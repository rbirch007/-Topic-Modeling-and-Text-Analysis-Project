            "content": "FROSTED TREES Grace M. Candland All trees in winter are a lovely sight When frost has settled round each limb and branch, As if some elfin artist would enhance Our joy, and make the somber day more bright. These jeweled pencils pointing to the sky Or fragile rods of pure white peppermint Are bits of glory without measured stint To tempt the notice of each passerby. The bitter winds and heaps of ice and snow Reveal a magic beauty all their own, And from their ample frigid arms we know The grand array of springtime buds are blown. Life, too, must have its cold and darksome day And yield its treasure as it slips away. The Cover: The cover \"Winter in City Creek Canyon, Salt Lake City, Utah\" is from a photograph by Grace O. Tuttle. GENERAL PRESIDENCY OF RELIEF SOCIETY PRESIDENT AMY BROWN Lyman. FIRST COUNSELOR MARCIA K. HOWELLS SECOND COUNSELOR BELLE S. SPAFFORD AT the opening of a new year, we are generally more inclined than at any other time to try to visualize what lies immediately ahead. We wonder what the new year will bring. It is a time also when we are most inclined to make new resolutions, and new plans, taking into account the mistakes and failures of the past and focusing our attention on our highest and most cherished ideals. And now what of this new year? What will it bring? With war raging all around the globe, impoverishing the whole earth, and inflicting on civilization the severest blows which it has ever received, with sorrow and tragedy entering home after home, the future seems discouraging and unpredictable. We therefore face the new year with sad hearts and with our minds disturbed and perplexed and filled with anxiety, apprehension, and uncertainty. It is obvious that our first duty, and that which lies closest at hand, is to do what is humanly possible to comfort those who are sad and bereft and, through earnest and sober prayer, ask our Heavenly Father to bless them and to give us all divine guidance through this period of peril. Let us, however, not lose hope, let us not lose faith. Let us cling to the thought that the thousands, yes millions, of peace-loving, righteous, Godfearing people in the world can, through faith and works and prayers, help to bring about what one philosopher has called \"the rule of intelligence, of morals and of law.\" Let us remember what the Lord said toAbra-ham regarding the righteous as a protection to the wicked. In Genesis 18:26 we read, \"And the Lord said. If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\" He later declared that he would save the city if only ten righteous could be found. Let us have faith and keep in mind the words of Jesus to his disciples: \"And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said. Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain. Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you\" (Matt. 17:18-20). What the world most needs today is the acceptance and application of the laws of God as these are set forth in the Decalogue, and amplified by the Savior in the Sermon on the Mount. When the children of Israel strayed away from the teachings of their Maker, when they set up and worshipped an idol in the form of a golden calf, through Moses they were given the Ten Commandments written by God with his own hand on tablets of stone. When Christ came to redeem Israel and the world, he restated, emphasized, and amplified the teachings of Sinai. These laws and teachings are fundamental and eternal. And now, today, when so many people have departed from or set aside the laws and teachings of God and, in their place, have set up new man-made philosophies which have brought upon mankind many great and mighty evils the like of which the world has never known before, it is time for us to struggle, as best we can, to apply these fundamental teachings which have been a guide through the ages, and to awaken in the hearts of all people such an interest in the things of God that they will make an effort to live righteous lives and thus help to bring peace and freedom to all mankind.

And what shall comfort the heart that yearns To lose the memory of sacrifice, What valid solace shall his loved ones give To heal the lost look in a soldier's eyes. By what eternal measure shall he live? Give him the river's song, the shadowed hill, A road that leads to his familiar door, Make his mornings eager and his midnight still Page 6 PRIZE-WINNING POEMS And give to him the love he waited for; Give him this recompense, confirm his choice-Children's laughter home a woman's voice. 11 Metal that made the sword can shape a plow, The tool of promise, strength, security-Give a man the brighter blade, show him how To cleave the ground in furrowed symmetry, This is an ancient truth and long revealed, Dominion of the earth is sure defense, And by this touch a broken man is healed  In seed and soil he finds his recompense. For there is solace where the snow has lain And comfort when the fallow season turns To April's chalice and the sound of rain. Once more, like hopeful grass, the seared heart learns That tenure of the earth alone can bring The jewelled sunlight to the field of spring. Ill In Sabbath twilight let the soldier find The open door, the edifice of prayer. Let all the battered ramparts of his mind Receive the sound of benediction there. Too vivid still he bears the lash of memory. And yet the sacred parables can light The wilderness of doubt that men may see A lambent star above the hills of night. Give him the quietness of sacrament. The Bible's treasured word and organ tone, The union of this brotherhood be sent For recompense that once he knelt alone; And let only luminous words be said In worship when the soldier bows his head.

CHRISTIE LUND COLES Second Prize Poem Aftermath Christie Lund Coles I Today I walked with autumn on a hill And all the autumns of our past came back; All the wide acres of my heart grew still As swallows traced the sky in seamless track; My heart was heavy with its aching loss, The honk of wild geese left me as forlorn And desolate as barren trees, across The far horizon where the mist is born. Today I walked with autumn and with this  An hour of stark and timeless quietude; I knew all I could bear of loneliness, I faced infinities of solitude. For memories too, leave but a seamless track. Since loneliness nor tears can bring you back! PRIZE-WINNING POEMS II I remember a day of autumn weather  The heft of the wind and the slant of sun, The edge of cold when winter was at its tether, The scent of trampled leaves as the year was done; And while I walk alone in these same places, I think of you, the wall of slivered rain, The brook-cool air upon our lifted faces. The words we whispered that were said in vain. I know a sudden, dark, recurrent yearning, Remembering that opalescent dusk Lying on valleys where the season, turning, Was marked by jeweled sun on the corn's dry husk; Still I am sure as leaves in autumn weather That in the wind of death we'll be together. Il Sleep, beloved, here where the grass is fluted By the wind on this green and lonely hill. Sleep and be glad that your anguish is muted. Sleep undisturbed by the world at its kill; Now I must stand here alone, bereft, seeing The town where we walked alive and unaware That death could part us, sorrow eat at our being, Betray us, track us down like a beast to its lair. Soon I will go back into the city, Back to the clamor and passions of men, I will not expect nor find any pity, Uncomforted, I will lie awake again With loneliness beyond the name of grief-Yet spring returns.. And life.. And budding leaf. This is the second time Christie Lund Coles has been an award winner in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest having received first prize in last year's contest. She also won second prize in the Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest for 1943.

CAROLINE EYRING MINER THIRD PRIZE POEM That Which Sustains Caroline Eyring Miner Yesterday They knew, who walked the trackless desert miles, Who breathed the dust the oxen powdered fine And forded rivers, trying to divine The way where savage, beast, would not discern Their presence. They who walked in endless files And halted but to dig their graves no sign To mark the spot  they knew the great design Could not be stayed nor curbed by man's concern, They knew they were the instruments of God And these were moments of eternity. The thought sustained them as they slowly trod Their way. This was for their posterity. Because their purpose was divine, complete, Their weariness, their sacrifice, was sweet. Today Within this quiet church they surely know. The warm light filters through the colored glass And gold and silver merge as minutes pass And sunlight touches young and older heads Bent reverently. The flowers in the low White bowl are gay and bright, a lovely mass Of bloom. No harmony can ever surpass This scene of perfect peace. And as he reads, 'The Lord is verily our own good shepherd/' The speaker knows that all assembled feel Secure, despite the warring world, the Lord Who led them here, will to their sons reveal His power in their extremest need. To be So certain is to glimpse eternity. Tomorrow I know that though the sun goes down today. Tomorrow it will rise again; the flower. Remembered perfume, colored dust, an hour From now, in God's own time, will bloom again. These things I know for I have seen. They say I only have the vision of this earth, the power To know the clearly proven fact. The Tower Of Babel was confusion, for those men Sought heaven by building solid rock and stone. Is sweet content the fruit of. Other tree? The peace beyond our knowledge comes alone Through perfect trust and faith and will to see That God yet rules the troubled earth and through The sacrament of sorrow, he'll come to you.

Winning Story Annual Relief Society Snort Story Contest First Prize Story Rock Roses of Nazareth Ethel Newman Eccles A bluish mist hung over the silent little village. The murky darkness trailed off into pale gray above the rolling hills in the distance. Spring in Nazareth was a paradise, and it was spring. Nazareth lay among the hills 1200 feet above the sea. It could be reached from the fertile plain below only by a tedious climb through a narrow, steep, and rough mountain path. Here lived Lydia. Her house was one of the finest; its courtyard one of the most comfortable, and its roof commanded an unsurpassed view. Here she sat in her leisure hours by the window. With soft, brown eyes she looked across the low-roofed houses, built of yellow-white limestone, so dazzling in the sun. From her smooth forehead fell the white woven veil of the young Jewish maiden. It fell in weighty folds about her slender figure. Her dress was low-cut, and of the finest fabric. It spread about her lovely, sandal-clad feet in cascades of purest white. The room was bare save for a few mats lying evenly against the wall. The water jars stood before the door. The landscape of distant hills, the nearer view of square-roofed houses with their purity of line and color. ETHEL NEWMAN ECCLES and the immaculate interior of the tiny house well befitted the spirit of the beautiful Jewish maiden, for Lydia's heart was pure. Many a long day this lovely girl had gone about her household chores with one, great, overwhelming thought lighting the way: The Christ, yes, he was to come; to be born as a tiny babe; and greatest of all great joys, he was to come to a Jewish maiden. Lydia raised herself from the low stool. She passed her hand lightly over her forehead and down her cheeks to her sounding throat. Through the soft folds of her dress she passed her hand, and at last gently she bowed her head in thanksgiving for this strength and loveliness. For might not the Holy Father see fit to crown her womanhood with the greatest of all the desires of a Jewish maiden: to be the mother of the Christ?\nLydia hugged the thought to her heart. In her strong young arms she held, in her mind's eye, the tiny body of her little son. And, in the overwhelming positiveness at the thought, she prayed, in the purity of her soul, that she, of all the Jewish maidens, might be the one chosen to bear God's Son.\nDarkness fell, and still Lydia knelt by the little white stool, her head bowed in prayer and her heart beating in wild desire. A strange peace came over her, an assurance that the Holy Father, with his understanding kindness, was near; that he had heard her prayer, she was sure. Would he answer it?\nThe enveloping peace that had come to her in this sweet hour gave her hope, enveloping, heavenly hope.\nIt was here that Joses found her when he came with jars of fresh water from the well the small one great hope that some day Lydia would become his wife; for were they not of marriageable age and of the same station?\nHe stepped lightly over the threshold, leaving his sandals outside. He lifted Lydia to her feet and with his arms around her, with a smile, gently he put his hands to his shoulders and pushed him away. \"No, Joses,\" she said, \"the Christ has not yet come to earth. Let us forget that we once had thought...\"\nThe pallor of her face told him what was in her mind; this decision after many sleepless nights. In that moment the young Jewish boy knew that Lydia would only live for the coming of the Son of God.\nEach day Joses came as of other days. He carried her water jars and attended to the little tasks that needed to be done. Always the beloved the stately moving Lydia with hungering eyes. Always she was kind, always grateful, but always living in the dreamy future. For her there was but one great thought the Christ would come to a Jewish maiden, one of them. For this Lydia lived.\nDay followed day, and her longing became more intense. More and more she lived in herself, and more and more shut Joses away from her life. She busied herself in her garden, which yielded for her sweet-smelling anemones, pink phlox, rock roses, and the asphodel. On her day she went to the synagogue, but only by the back street, and veiled.\nJoses still brought the water jars, but never lingered into the shadowy evenings. Finally, he stopped coming at all. Lydia took the water from the well alone. And the blows were too heavy for her were left undone.\nFrom her window she could see Joses often walking with other Jewish maidens along the sloping vineyards, or hear his pleasant laugh rise clear from among the white and scarlet blossoms of orange and pomegranate. She had the dreadful temptation to call Joses back to her. She longed to make him happy; and loose folds about her. The light of yet, surely, the dear Lord would hope and sweetness shone from her meet out to Joses a goodly portion, clear young eyes as she rose at Joses' for had he not been always a good entering. Nazarene? He told her simply and reverently of the message of Christ's birth that SPRINGTIME \n\ncame again to had been carried over the land.

For one short Lydia remained joyous and hope moment she stood before him thus, ful through the brilliant sunshine while the light of hope faded from and color. But when later the trees her face. Were barren and the low, dry hills Joses watched her anguish. He spread endlessly in the distance, dis took her two warm hands in his. Turbing thoughts took hold of her, \"My Lydia,\" he said, \"other sons tortuously. It was only a few and daughters of our Father will be months later that the signs for which sent to earth. Mayhap one will come everyone watched, and which every yet to you that will fill your heart's one knew, came to pass. Longing.\" Cradled in a manger and honored \"Think you, Joses, that my long-by shepherds and wise men, the ing for the Son of God has been Christ, the Savior of the world, was wrong in his sight?\" Lydia asked, born. True, to a Jewish maiden, but \"For you, my Lydia, there is no not to the lovely Lydia. Wrong,\" Joses replied. He put his It was not long after the coming arms tenderly about her. This time of the Savior that the news came to she did not draw back. The tears Lydia. It was Joses who brought it dried on her lashes. She took Joses' to her; not as a mockery or in the strong, kind hand in her own and spirit of exultation. Only that she dropping to her knees beside the lit-might need him now a friend. For tie stool, she prayed, only Joses knew the disappointment A quiet peace came over her. Lydia could feel. \"Bless thou that other Jewish maid-He found her kneeling above the en with joy in her little Son.\" Thus low prayer stool. The folds of her she prayed because her heart was lovely dress and veil fell in soft, pure. Ethel Newman Eccles, a native of Salt Lake City now living in Washington, D.

Lydia remained strong and hopeful through the brilliant sunshine and color. But when later the trees were barren and the low, dry hills offered endlessly in the distance, disturbing thoughts took hold of her, nervously. It was only a few months later that the signs for which everyone had watched and which everyone believed in came to pass.\nLydia knelt in a manger and honored the Shepherds and wise men, the Christ, the Savior of the world, was born. True, to a Jewish maiden, but not to the lovely Lydia.\nIt was not long after the coming of the Savior that the news came to Lydia. It was Joses who brought it to her, not as a mockery or in the spirit of exultation. Only that she might need him now a friend. For only Joses knew the disappointment Lydia could feel.\nHe found her kneeling above the low prayer stool. The folds of her lovely dress and veil fell in soft, loose folds about her. The light of hope and sweetness shone from her clear young eyes as she rose at Joses' entering.\nHe told her simply and reverently of the message of Christ's birth that had been carried over the land. Lydia sighed and stood before him, poised as if ready for flight. For one short moment she stood before him thus, while the light of hope faded from her face.\nJoses watched her anguish.

            "content": "A Few of Our Gifted Utah Women Artists Alice Merrill Home Former Member of Relief Society General Board Part II While Dr. Heber John Richards was visiting and traveling in art centers of Europe with his wife and daughters, Hattie married, in the city of Paris, J. T. Harwood, her former art teacher in Utah. The young couple spent their honeymoon at Pont Aven a French fishing port where they both painted. Hattie Harwood's still life \"Pumpkin\" won a name for the young artist in a day, when it was accepted and hung in the beautiful Woman's Building of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago. Hattie was a painter of flowers, too. Her still life was distinguished. Hattie's father and her grandfather, Dr. Willard Richards, who was first editor of the Deseret News, were both college men of high attainments. Hattie, too, possessed a legal mind. She read her father's scientific works, took extension courses in research, and such studies as geology and astronomy at the University of Utah. Hattie's mother, Julia Johnson, was a daughter of Ellis Johnson, biologist and horticulturist of Southern Utah in pioneer days. Both mother and daughter had the gift to propagate rare house plants. The Harwoods went to California in search of greater art opportunities. The young mother, stricken with a toxic goiter, was forced to lie in bed. From books brought her from the public libraries, before her death, she went, in imagination, with the North and South Polar Expeditions. Ruth Har-wood, poet and illustrator, is their daughter. Harwood painted several lovely portraits of his beautiful wife. A school collection should be named for her and contain some of her own work, and also some of Harwood's portraits of this gifted woman.  Hattie Richards Harwood PETUNIAS AT WINDOW UTAH WOMEN ARTISTS Rachel Grant Taylor THE HOME OF YESTERYEAR Rachel Grant Taylor   In Rachel Grant Taylor's recent water colors is seen a rich flowering of a gift to paint. The Heber City Central School has named its collection for Rachel Grant Taylor. The school children purchased Rachel's \"Blossoming Trees\" and the artist presented \"Yesteryear's Barn.\" The Alice Merrill Home gift was Rachel's \"Pleasant Valley Hill Foliage.\" This painting of charm reveals oak brush which is almost moving. The whole landscape seems diffused with a soft light reminiscent of the end of day. Also there is a feeling of the last day of summer. This painting, purchased for a gift painting to honor Bathsheba W. Smith, pioneer artist, is a part of Mrs. Taylor's collection. Rachel's love for art is not stronger than her husband's, for John H. Taylor, though modest of his prowess, is an art collector in his own right and cherishes his art collection. Ruth Ballard Snow   a Utah artist who resides at Arlington, Va., is winning for herself a place among contemporary American artists. Mrs. Snow holds membership in the Society of Washington Artists, and Virginia Art League. Her work has been exhibited at the Philips Memorial Gallery and with the Society of Washington Etchers, Carnegie Library. Recently, at the Seventeenth Biennial Exhibition in the Corcoran Gallery of Art, she won honorable mention. She is an art instructor at Corcoran Art School, being assistant to Nickolai Cicousky, the noted figure painter. Formerly in Utah as head of Granite High art department, her work was more or less profound. Ruth married Dale C. Snow and went to Washington where her husband was employed with the Government.  Ruth Ballard Snow PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER Opportunities came fast from the day she entered Corcoran School to continue her art studies. The work of this artist has found ready sale in Utah when she exhibits with the Utah Art Colony of which she is a cherished member. In the East, sales follow her exhibitions. Mrs. Snow's father, the late Melvin J. Ballard, has been recognized for his eloquence as a preacher and he could have made a place for himself in the concert hall with his fine baritone voice. Like her father, Mary Ruth, as she is often called, possesses a fine presence, is a good speaker and wins friends by her charming personality. Her mother has the gift of design. The writer, with President Emmeline B. Wells, visited the Ballard home in Portland as guests of the Northwestern Mission. Mrs. Ballard's home management, her hospitality, her entertainment of guests, and the work of her hands shown in clothing her children and decorating the home, revealed an artistic temperament which carried over to Mary Ruth. Grace Cutler Solomon, granddaughter of the late John C. Cutler, has gifts in her own right. A water colorist of varied attainments, she writes verse and paints pictures as did her poet uncle, Alfred Lambourne. This young artist's Winter Exhibition contained a subtle \"Winter Fields\" as well as \"House of Memories,\" which bravely depicted a quaint pioneer home  both water colors were snatched up by a private collector. Grace C. Solomon GARDEN FLOWERS UTAH WOMEN ARTISTS 19 -Ida May Savage ANCIENT POTTERY Mrs. Solomon is often represented by a design which is fancifully created from one flower. Several collections have chosen her design from a magnolia or some other favorite flower. This ambitious artist is able to maintain a beautiful home and family life with her gifted husband, C. Francis Solomon. Recently she, with her daughter, was in Chicago, brushing up at the Chicago Art Institute. Ida May Savage was blue-eyed, fair, a true blonde, with a charming personality. She was a promising student of Harwood and painted flowers with flower quality. There was grace and charm in her compositions and she painted only clean color. Daughter of Charles R. Savage who made a circle of love for art around him, Ida died too young, and to keep her memory green the lovely creations of her hand could well be brought together to establish a school collection with her dear name attached thereto. Mary Teasdel   a much traveled person, was a graduate of the University of Utah. She studied piano, voice, and an extended art course under J. T. Harwood and continued in Paris for three years. On her return home, Miss Teasdel was elected third president of the Utah Art Institute when, with the help of Cyrus E. Dallin, her close friend, the New York and Boston artists sent outstanding canvases to the annual exhibition held at the old Social Hall. Mary took her mother with her for a second trip to Europe. Miss Teasdel was a brilliant conversationalist and correspondent. Perhaps no other art teacher was more inspiring than Mary. She possessed a remarkable vocabulary and her knowledge of art was broad. The writer has heard her criticisms in class lectures illustrating a certain problem in art. She would say, \"Velasquez the Spanish painter would render the problem this way; Rembrandt used this method; Rubens treated it like this; and James McNeill Whistler (who was her main inspiration) would have this version.\"  Mary Teasdel BLOSSOMS Any art student would be fortunate to be under Mary Teasdel's wing. J. T. Harwood, her teacher, had the first painting from Utah hung in the Salon. Mary Teas-del was next to be hung in the Spring Salon. She had the honor of having three miniatures chosen for the French Exposition in 1900. Two of her portraits are in the State Alice Art Collection which received the $300 prize. She had the gift to achieve simplicity in her work, for in her fine use of colors as well as in the painting of rich fabrics, she accomplished perhaps the greatest quality of art  repose. Thirty-two of Mary Teasdel's paintings hang in a memorial collection as a civic collection at the Smithfield Carnegie Public Library. HILMA Mole Payne   One of Utah's virile artists and named among the 500 American artists   paints with enthusiasm Utah's blue skies, the Weber River, cottonwood trees, blossoming orchards, spring, and reflections in both pond and running brook. Hilma Mole studied with Harwood at the University of Utah. A trip abroad visiting the galleries of both the Old World and the United States did much for this ambitious artist. Hilma begins right by first creating a design for her pictures. She is a colorist and knows her tools well; and so produces works of art. Coupled with the ability to work, Hilma has the necessary qualifications to make what we call a \"born artist.\" She is also a financier. Last fall when the pickers failed to appear at the Payne orchard, she gathered 400 bushels of apples and sold them, too. The Wasatch High School Hilma Mole Payne Art Collection in Heber City is among the best of Utah's thirty public school collections. In addition, her work is hung in many other picture galleries and private collections in the State. A. J. Payne, her husband, and James, the son, are proud of the accomplishments of this woman who is winning a name for herself in the Utah Art Colony exhibitions. Mr. Payne, a native of Tennessee, once kept the missionaries from being mobbed, and then made friends with the mobbers who joined his Sunday School class."

Palestine Dr. Lehnd Hargrave Creer Head of the Department of History and Political Science, University of Utah Part II [This is the last installment of the final article in the series by Dr. Creer on the historical background of some of the countries involved in the present war. The map of Palestine appeared in the Magazine for December 1944.  Ed.] IN the administration of their mandate obligations with regard to Palestine, the British were too ready to believe that the French would show genuine consideration for Arab hopes and ambitions elsewhere. In this they were to be mistaken. While, in 1936, the French permitted the twin republics of Lebanon and Syria to become established, they have yet to promise the much-sought-for independence of these states. Hence, the Arabs have become increasingly discontented. French maladministration, too, in Syria, culminated in the infamous Druse Revolt in 1927. The British have been unduly optimistic, also, in that they have consistently entertained the opinion that the economic advantages occasioned by the Jewish occupation of Palestine would overcome racial and political prejudices there. It is true that the increasing prosperity of Palestine occasioned by the successful efforts of the Zionists to reclaim the land and to develop the natural resources of the country, for awhile, did allay the hostility of the Arabs. But, when the number of Jewish immigrants increased until by 1929 some 160,000 had entered the country and it was feared that a complacent minority might soon become an aggressive and ambitious majority, the Arabs became increasingly restless and flared up into open revolt in 1929. Page 22 On September 1, 1922, Sir Herbert Samuel, British High Commissioner, promulgated a constitution for Palestine. It provided for a high commissioner, a commander-in-chief and an appointive executive council. There was also to be a legislative council, consisting of the high commissioner and twenty-two deputies, ten of whom were to be appointed by the high commissioner and the remaining twelve (eight Moslems, two Christian, and two Jews) to be elected. The Moslems, however, considered the arrangement to be unfair, and refused to participate in the elections. Thereupon, the high commissioner was obliged to govern with the aid, only, of an appointive council. Friction between Arabs and Jews crystallized into a violent Anti-Jewish onthrust in August 1930. The Arabs complained particularly of the British land legislation which, they claimed, had enabled the Zionist to buy up large portions of the none-too-plentiful arable land, thus threatening the existence of thousands of Arabs. They also objected to the type of Jewish immigrants, who, they declared, were refugees of the lower classes from Russia, Rumania, and Poland, and these, they averred, entertained radical political philosophies, dangerous and inimical to the safety and security of the state. In the civil war which followed, 23 I understand this is for academic research on historical print culture. While I cannot make legal determinations about copyright status, I can help with OCR correction of this historical text excerpt.\nHere is the corrected transcription:\n\nlowed, several Jewish villages were attacked and more than 100 Jews killed. The British Government rushed warships and supplies to the scene and quickly restored order. A Royal Commission was then appointed by Sir Walter Shaw, established \"the Arab feeling of animosity and hostility toward the Jews, consequent upon the disappointment of their political and national aspirations, and for their economic future.\" But of this important report is worth reproducing here.\nThe Arab population, whilst baking the advantages enjoyed by the Jewish settler, views with apprehension their increasing rapidity, while the land available for their sustenance has decreased by about 250,000 acres. This area has passed into Jewish hands. It can now be definitely stated that at the present rate, and even with the present methods of Arab cultivation of the land, there is not a large margin of land available for agricultural development by new immigrants, with the exception of such underdeveloped land at the various Jewish organisations hold in reserve.\nIt was further pointed out that the Jewish Promotion Fund, which rented land to the Jews, forbade the employment of Arab labor on its soil, and that the policy of the General Federation of Jewish Labor was to import Jewish workers rather than to hire bindles Arabs.\nTHE publication of the Shaw report caused the British Government to modify its policy, and to suspend, indefinitely, immigration permits already issued to some 2,500 prospective Jewish immigrants. This action was enthusiastically received by the Palestinian Arabs, who now look forward confidently to a far greater part in the government of the state by supporting the constitution of\n1922. But the Jews, both within and without Palestine, were angry. Dr. Chaim Weizmann resigned as president of the World Zionist Organization. The British Government was accused of \"a monumental act of bad faith,\" \"betrayal\" and of \"almost impartial lack of gratitude.\" But the MacDonald Government (1931) insisted that it was simply striving to carry out the three-fold task of giving the Jews a National Home in Palestine, of dealing fairly with the large Moslem majority, and of preparing the land for eventual self-government.\nIn accordance with the recommendation of the Shaw Commission, still further investigations were undertaken in Palestine. Sir John Hope Simpson spent three months inquiring into problems of land settlement, immigration, and the development of the mandate system. The Hope Simpson Report was published in October 1930. This was followed by a government statement of policy, known as the Lord Passfield White Paper. Both documents supported the Shaw Report and endorsed the new British policy of restricted immigration. However, in 1932, the government relaxed its immigration restrictions to the extent that it modified Jews to Palestine provided they were farmers, merchants, or businessmen, who possessed at least $2,500 in capital. It was also announced that a like quota of 4,500 would be permitted during a six-month period, commencing October 1, 1932. By 1935, there were in Palestine more than 500,000 Jews, and the amount of land held by them had increased to 141 km. On the close of World War I (1918), Jews in Palestine were reported to have a population of 60,000 in 1933, and to be increasing at the rate of 15,000 a year. As the number of Jewish immigrants steadily increased until the number of those entering Palestine in 1935 reached 61,854 as compared with 42,359 for 1934 feeling hardened only 5,249 for the year 1929, and the despite the restrictive immigration policy adopted by the British Government following the publication of the Shaw Report in 1930 striction between Arabs and Jews became more intense, and culminated, finally, in the Arab National Strike and boycott of 1936. Jewish population in Palestine had increased from seventy-eight to eighty-one square miles in 1919, to over 130 per square mile in 1936. By 1937, the total population was nearly 1,400,000, of which about 400,000 (or over one-fourth) were Jewish. According to informed observers, it was calculated that if immigration were allowed to continue at the rate reached in 1935, it would overtake the Arab figure in twelve years, and that if it continued at only half the rate, at 30,000 per year, the two peoples would be approximately equal in 1960. As the year 1936 approached, the prevailing Arabic unrest in Palestine was heightened by a number of external incidents. Among them was the war mentioned above against Italy in Ethiopia, the conflict with its serious repercussions affecting both the British and the French in Egypt and Syria, both neighboring Arab states. In Syria, the Arabs successfully demanded and received a guarantee of republican government. A Memorandum filed by the Palestinian Arabs, in November, 1936, by the Grand Mufti on his return to the British High commissioner the price of future Arab co-operation. The most important demands included: (1) the establishment of a democratic government, (2) prohibition of the transfer of Arab lands to the Jews, and (3) a drastic curtailment of the immigration of Jews. The White Paper issued for the bitter purpose, a \"competent committee\" should be set up \"to determine the absorptive capacity of the country\" and that \"there should be an immediate interim suspension of the Jewish immigration.\"\nFailure of High Commissioner Sir Arthur Wauchope, to respond satisfactorily to Arab demands, and led to the proclamation, on April 19, 1936, of an Arab National Political Strike directed against the British Mandatory Government. Organized terrorism was let loose upon the countryside. There were strikes in the towns; guerilla warfare in the highlands; looting and armed bands of Arabs roamed over the whole of Palestine. During the six months that the strike was in progress, there were about 400 Jewish and 1,600 Arab casualties. Quick military action by the British brought the Strike to an end in October 1936.\nLike previous uprisings, the National Arab Strike was followed by the dispatch of a British Court of Inquiry, this time the Peel and Woodhead Commission, which was to investigate the underlying causes and to propose remedies.\" The \"underlying causes\" of the friction were found to be the same as those which had led to the disturbances of 1920, 1921, 1929, and 1933, namely, \"the desire of the Arabs for national independence and their hatred and fear of the establishment of the Jewish National Home.\" Among the recommendations made by the Commission were the following: adequate political representation for the Arabs through a Pan-Arab assembly; restrictions and safeguarding of the sale of Arab lands; censorship, for the time being, of Jewish immigration; and finally, the formation of Arab cooperative societies on the same pattern as those founded by the Zionists; and the increased restriction of Jewish immigration based upon the principle of \"political\" and \"economic absorptive capacity of Palestine,\" which, for five years after its initiation, would limit Jewish immigrants to an annual maximum of 12,000 persons. The Commission's one revolutionary recommendation, however, was the surgical operation of partition. The following illuminating extract from the Peel Report explains the reason for this suggestion:\nThe application to Palestine of the Mandate System in general and of the specific mandate in particular implied the belief that the obligations thus undertaken towards the Arabs and the Jews respectively would prove in course of time to be mutually compatible owing to the conciliatory effect on the Palestinian Arabs of the material prosperity which Jewish immigration would bring to Palestine as a whole. That belief has not been justified, and there seems to be no hope of its being justified in the future. \nReduced to its simplest terms, the recommendation of partition envisioned the establishment of two sovereign independent states, plus a mandated area or enclave, which should contain Jerusalem and Bethlehem. The Arab state would comprise Trans-Jordan Palestine, and Transjordania. The Jewish National Home was to encompass Northern Palestine, including the Jezreel and Esdraelon valleys, and all the fertile coastal plain. It was intended that the mandated area should include Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Nazareth, together with a corridor extending to the former by the Mediterranean seaboard. The Commission even further recommended that the Mandatory Government should keep open an Arab corridor to the Mediterranean, debouching from the Jewish enclave with a terminus at the proposed Arab port of Jaffa. The MacDonald Government should likewise guarantee Arab access to Gaza and Haifa, with shared participation. These was further recommendations that a new and re-stated for the relative infertility of their lands by a stipulated grant of 2,000,000 pounds. The proposed Jewish National Home would, by the Peel recommendation, be reduced in size to an area equivalent to that of the State of Delaware, but it would include, in the better sense of the word, the more productive areas of Haifa and Tel Aviv, the latter, the target important city area in Palestine. It was stipulated, further, that both Arab and Jewish states would be required to enter into military alliances with Great Britain, and that, for the present, the important naval base and anchorage terminus at Haifa would be left in British hands.\nThe Peel Report was not well received by either the parties most involved. The Arabs rejected the report uncompromisingly. They demanded unequivocally an arrangement which would regulate the Jews to minority status throughout the whole of Palestine. The Twentieth Zionist Congress was not satisfied with the proposed new state boundaries, yet recommended further negotiations with the British Government along the lines of partition. They declared themselves more in favor of the scheme or provisional cantonment; a plan whereby existing communities of Jews or Arabs would be formed into separate political entities or units, under the direction of a central or federal government. The Congress very sharply criticized the Peel recommendation with regard to further immigration restriction.\nAlthough the British Government at last formally approved the Peel Report, opposition was so strong to further partition plans that in 1938 that the Cabinet voted to table the plan; pending further study. Meanwhile, civil war again flared up in Palestine. Beginning in 1938, \"riots, sniping, bomb throwing, assassinations, banditry and inter-race outrages were of almost daily occurrence.\" The Government sought to re-establish order through reinforcement, hangings, and execution. In July 1938, marines were landed at Haifa and additional troops ordered to the interior. In light of these circumstances, it is not surprising that the British authorities in November 1938, announced that the Government had abandoned the plan for partition and that a new and definite plan was put forward, but it was stated that an effort would be made to iron out the difficulty through conferences with Arabic and Jewish leaders early in 1939.\nThe proposed conference met in London on February 7, 1939, but it was apparently foredoomed to failure, for the Arabs stubbornly refused to sit with the Jewish delegates, or to discuss their mutual problem with them. So the Arab and Jewish delegates met separately with the British representatives of the British Government, and the conference became, in effect, two parallel conferences, and when the British representatives sought to be mediators. In the end, as it turned, by both groups, the conference came to an untimely end.\nAS a result of the failure of the Arab-Jewish conference, the British Government, on May 17, 1939, issued its official statement of policy with regard to Palestine in what is commonly known as the MacDonald White Paper. This document envisaged the establishment, within ten years, of an independent Palestinian state, in which both Jews and Arabs were to participate equally, according to population, in a representative form of government. When once established, the independent state would be obligated by treaty relationship only with Great Britain. A transitory or probationary period of ten years was specified for the development of self-government. If, at the end of this period, the British Government should consider that the establishment of the independent states should be postponed, the British administration could remain unchanged. PALESTINE 27 The representatives of the people of Palestine, the Council of the League of Nations and the neighboring Arab states for arbitration. During the ten-year probationary period, the independence of the state as envisioned by the high commissioner, and the Jewish immigration limited to 75,000 that is, for the first five-year period ending June, 1944; and thereafter, Jewish immigration would not be allowed, except an additional 25,000 which might be admitted as soon as it might be possible to arrange for their maintenance in Palestine, \"as a contribution towards the solution of the Jewish refugee problem/' As an answer to claims and counter-claims and \"in order to avoid all future misunderstandings/' this important paper was prefaced with the following statements with respect to previous commitments: (1) Regarding the Arab claim to independence, the British Government announces its adherence to the view that the whole of Palestine west of Jordan was excluded from Sir Henry McMahon's Pledge. (2) Regarding the character of the Jewish National Home in Palestine, the British Government announces its adherence to the Balfour Declaration of 1917 which was given in the Command Paper of 1922; namely, that the terms of the Balfour Declaration did not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a home should be founded in Palestine. (3) The fact that more than 300,000 Jews had immigrated to Palestine since 1922 and the fact that the National Home had risen by 1939 to some 450,000 approximately one-third of the entire country, gave conclusive evidence that the Mandatory Power had been carrying out its obligation. While the Arabs have acclaimed the new British policy, the ardent Zionists have denounced it, and maintain that \"it betokens a surrender to Moslem Terrorism.\" The British answer to this latest criticism, is well expressed in the concluding paragraph of the Chamberlain White Paper: His Majesty's Government cannot hope to satisfy the partisans of one party or the other in such a controversy as the Mandate has aroused. Their purpose is to be just as between the two peoples in Palestine whose destinies in that country have been affected by the great events of recent years, and who, since they live side by side, must learn to practice mutual tolerance, goodwill and co-operation. Complicated and difficult as the Arab-Jewish problem in Palestine appears, the writer ventures the following conclusions: (1) The only hope of the realization of Zionist ambitions for establishment of an exclusive Jewish National Home, a state controlled politically by a preponderate Jewish population, rests either in the application of the principle of expatriation or partition to the solution of the problem. In the case of the former, the problem is complicated because of the intense nationalistic aspirations of the Arabs already on the land; in the case of the latter, in the opinion of the writer the more feasible solution, the problem becomes involved because of the vast amount of capital already expended by the Zionists in the reclamation of the whole of Palestine, and because of the intense cultural and religious interests of both Jews and Arabs in shrines such as are included in the proposed Jerusalem enclave and which, in any plan of partition, must necessarily be excluded from the control of either race. (2) It appears from an examination of the postwar commitments with regard to Palestine, that both Zionists and Arab Nationalists have exaggerated their claims and falsely accused the British Mandatory Power of a breach of faith in their behalf. (3) Whatever the ultimate solution, this much is certain, the success of any future homeland for either Arabs or Jews in Palestine will depend upon their collaboration, cooperation, and mutual conciliation."

A Happy New Year to all our readers, patrons and friends! The beginning of a year is always fraught with sentimental feeling. We have just bid farewell to the old year, and there is a sort of sadness in the very fancy of parting, but the new year brings anticipation and sublime resolves, and the influence of the desire to do better, to aim higher, to live nearer to God, buoys one up and makes glad the dawn of the new year. The division of time is most wisely arranged, and the effect upon the human soul is inspirational. There is a time for all things, said the preacher, and if men were wise and judicious in the matter of time no doubt there would be. It is mortals who fall so far short, and not the great Dispenser of times and seasons and the over-ruler of all things....Home Affairs: The Office of the Woman's Exponent has been removed to the Hooper and Eldredge Block, Main Street, just a few doors south of Z. C. M. I., upstairs, in room No. 4. The merchants, coal-dealers and men in business have been liberal to the poor during the holiday time, and much has been distributed by the Bishops and the Relief Society through the city. The weather has been favorable for those who have been short of fuel, and it is ardently to be hoped that no one has suffered. There is certainly no need of any real suffering while the granaries and barns are filled with grain, and the cattle abound \"upon a thousand hills.\" Two handsome pictures hang on our walls received from the large mercantile firm of Z. C. M. I. They have been prepared expressly as a decorative advertisement, and certainly are artistic in design and coloring. Each has a calendar so on each day in the month and each month in the year when one refers to the calendar on the wall, one is reminded of the wholesale and retail establishments of Z.C.M.I, where they can always purchase the best quality of all varieties of goods at the most reasonable rates. Ladies can buy there fancy as well as staple groceries, glass, china and silver ware. Fancy dress goods in all styles, ribbons, scarfs, shawls, laces, gloves, hosiery, shoes of the best quality. A room has been fitted up where a lady can feel perfectly comfortable to try a shoe on. There have been a number of desirable changes made in the inside arrangements of goods during the past year, and a decided improvement is the result. Everybody trades at Z. C. M. I.

            "content": "Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon WITH the dawning of 1945 come the greatest opportunities of the ages for women. Peace-planning must be as careful and exhaustive as warplanning has been, or the world's tears will not cease to flow. It has always been woman's role to heal wounds; given the chance, she might do much to prevent them. Today's world needs tenderness, patience, the human mother-touch. But it can also use the intellects and skills of its countless, highly trained women to carry out the mandates of their hearts and their consciences. RECENT birthdays: We congratulate Sister Johanna Porter of Portsmouth, England, a faithful saint for eighty-five years, on her 100th birthday; Sister Maria K. Perssen of Cache Valley, now ninety-eight; Sister Winnifred Morris Tibbs, eighty-nine. Sister Tibbs, who has contributed verse to Thewas honored on her natal day by the ward Relief Society, and by the Daughters of the Pioneers. HOLLYWOOD has filmed the popular A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith. TN the United States armed forces Mrs. Jean Wessman of Salt Lake City has seven son; Mrs. Edwin E. Thurston of Provo has six sons; and Mrs. Hugh Ford, six brothers and one sister, children of the late General and Mrs. Carl Badger of Salt Lake City. Every woman's heart aches with sympathy for Mr. And Mrs. Alben Borgstrom of Utah, four of whose sons have been killed in action.

            "content": "A Stone, in Place of Bread \"Or what man is there of you, if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?\" (Matt. 7:9). THIS soul-searching question of the Savior recalls to one's mind the almost sublime relationship which exists between a child and his parents? the sweet dependency, utter trust, and confidence of a child in his parents, and the feeling of security enjoyed by the child because his parents ever strive to provide a protecting bulwark between him, in his youth, and the world at large. The parent, on his side, treasures his God-given eternal gift and plans and dreams for his future joy with almost a selfless love. In the early, formative years of a child's life before he has reached the years of accountability at the age of eight, the foundation of his character is built largely upon his observation of the actions of his parents and the training that they are able to implant as a guide to his conduct. Rarely does a parent fail to provide the necessary food for the full development of his child's physical body; but, in the matter of his full spiritual growth, how often does a man, \"if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?\" These early years are the golden time in which to feed a child the bread of life, the time to train him to pray, to keep holy the Sabbath day, to pay his tithing, to observe the Word of Wisdom, to uphold the Church authorities and in all his daily conduct to train him to live in such a way that the Spirit of the Lord may ever dwell with him. Any laxness in the strict observance of the laws of the Church by his parents will be noted by a child, and may have a lasting influence upon his future life. A mother who drinks tea or coffee opens wide the door for her child to reject other parts of the Word of Wisdom which she herself does observe. A father who allows liquor to be served in his home, even though he himself does not partake of it, is inviting his children to become partakers when they are grown. Page 30 The use of alcohol with its attendant misery and degradation is becoming more widespread each day, and all that any Latter-day Saint parent can do, by example and precept, to impress upon his children the tragic effects which alcohol has upon the lives of those who use it, is absolutely essential. These are but two instances of the many which might be cited where a parent offers to his child a stone in place of bread. In the matter of setting an example to one's children it might be profitable for Latter-day Saint parents also to consider the significance of these words of the Savior: Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise? (John 5:19) At the beginning of the new year, then, let any parent who may have been lax in the example he has set his child, set his house in order, and provide at all times for his child the bread of everlasting life. M.S.S. The Y. W. M. I. A. Observed its Diamon Jubilee. The Y.W.M.I.A. observed its diamond Jubilee, Tuesday, November 28, 1944, with impressive services conducted in the Lion House in the same room where President Brigham Young assembled his daughters seventy-five years ago and effected an organization whereby the daughters of Israel might \"get a living testimony of the truth\" and \"improve in everything that is good and beautiful.\" This Association originally known as the Retrenchment Association, later as the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association, and at present as the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, has, during its seventy-five years of existence, touched the lives of tens of thousands of the daughters of Zion, helping them to develop their talents, obtain knowledge of the gospel, and to live happy, useful lives in conformity with gospel standards.\nAn opening feature of the observance in the Lion House was the reading by Presiding Patriarch Joseph F. Smith of words spoken by President Young in founding the Association. President Lucy G. Cannon then spoke, relating interesting facts and incidents connected with its beginning. She also talked of the earnestness with which the daughters of President Young accepted their assignment as members of the Association, and also gave interesting statistics showing its activities and growth. Among the honored guests were Ruth May Fox, age ninety-one, only living past president of the organization who delightfully reminisced, and two of President Young's daughters, Mrs. Mabel Y. Sanborn and Mrs. Fannie Y. Clayton. A very impressive and appropriate feature of the occasion was the marking of the organization room by an artistic plaque bearing an inscription relative to the founding of the organization including words of President Young used in inaugurating the Association. Elder George Albert Smith, after paying tribute to the organization and those identified with it through the years, dedicated the plaque.\nThe Relief Society General Board recognizes the importance of the Y.W.M.I.A. in the program of the Church, and acknowledges with gratitude its excellent contribution in guiding and directing the daughters of Zion. It congratulates the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association on its past achievements and wishes for it continued growth and accomplishment. B.S.S. NOTES TO THE FIELD Remodeled clothing TODAY, when clothing is of wartime quality and prices are high, many women are finding it advantageous to search their closets for used clothing of prewar quality to remodel into attractive, serviceable garments. Children's clothing, at present, presents a special problem in that it is not only expensive and of wartime quality, but in many localities it is difficult to buy. The wise, thrifty mother is clothing her children with garments remade from used clothing. Following are a few suggestions for remodeling clothing: General Suggestions for Procedure 1. Be sure used material is worth using again. Don't waste time on worn, threadbare, or moth-eaten materials that won't last. 2. Be sure old articles are carefully picked apart, washed or dry cleaned, and pressed before using. Most woolen materials can be washed, 3. Be sure fabric is suitable for the planned remodeled article. Don't use materials of a weave, weight, or color not suited to the uses to which the remodeled article will be put. Some fabrics have a definite \"adult\" look and should be used in remodeling articles for adults; other fabrics are more suitable for children's clothing. Don't use material that is too heavy for small children's clothes. 4. A style should be chosen when remodeling to fit the material so that a minimum of piecing need be done. 5. Don't use original buttonholes, loop fastenings, etc., unless they are substantial. Generally, the original garment receives most wear at these points. Page 32 6. Be careful of color combinations. Poor color combinations may readily spoil an otherwise attractive garment. 7, Material that is worth using is worthy of good workmanship. The same fine workmanship should go into remodeled articles as goes into articles made of new material. Suggestive Remodeling Projects A. For boys 1. Pants from adults' pants 2. Overcoats from adults' overcoats (if material isn't too heavy). 3. Snowsuits from old suits or coats, or from woolen or heavy part-woolen blankets. 4. Shirts in small sizes from adults' shirts, especially from dress shirts where, frequently, only the collar is worn. 5. Shorts from men's shirts (if material is strong enough). 6. Sport coats from men's coats (if they have patch pockets). If pockets are set-in, then a sleeveless jerkin could be made, or the back and sleeves could be used for part of a sport coat and a contrasting material could be used to complete the garment. 7. Coveralls or play suits for the small child who crawls or for the toddler ?either boy or girl?from the backs of the legs of old overalls. B. For girls 1. Suits from men's suits (if fabric and color are suitable). 2. Small gored skirts or jumpers from men's coats. 3. Coats from ladies' coats (if material is sufficiently youthful looking)- 4. Dresses from adults' dresses (if fabric and color are suitable). 5. White blouses from men's white shirts. NOTES TO THE FIELD 33 7. Panties from shirt tails, from the bottom of underslips, or from underslips used with sheer party or formal dresses. 8. Front aprons from men's shirts. 9. Jerkins from soft woolen articles. 10. Envelope handbags, lapel ornaments, half hats or flowers for the hair, and other accessories, from old bright felt hats. General Suggestions 1. Pieces cut from old suits or coats, crocheted around and sewed together make good afghans. Old cotton house dresses, shirts and aprons cut and sewed may be used for woven throw rugs, hooked rugs, or other types of rugs. Salt or sugar sacks sewed together and hemmed make very satisfactory dishcloths. Flour sacks dyed and sewed together make satisfactory soft quilt linings. (It is almost impossible to buy plain materials suitable for this purpose at the present time.) Good pieces of knit underwear crocheted around make satisfactory wash cloths."

            "content": "Mama's Boy Alice Morrey Bailey TOMMY 34 Mama's Boy\nBy Jane Mercy Bailey\nTOMMY began to get the feeling even before Billy punched him in the ribs. It was afternoon, and Miss Deering was putting number work on the blackboard. ?Lookee here? Billy said displaying the small plastic jeep, shining new from the top of his pocket. Tommy looked at it with interest, wishing he could have one just like it. ?And lookee here,\" said Billy, showing a bright toy and a pack of marbles, still in the red mesh bag. They were beautiful marbles of clear, polished glass, and caught the light in small pools of blue, yellow, crystal, and green. Tommy?s fingers wanted to touch them, but he didn?t reach out. Billy always had new things-new pencils, new erasers, and new toys.\n\"Where'dja get them?\" Tommy asked. \"Glancing around, Billy leaned closer. \"Come with me down to the five and ten after school, and we'll get you some.\"\n\"I haven't any money,\" said Tommy.\n\"Don?t need money. You just take them. I'll show you how.\"\n\"But we would be stealing?\"\n\"Naw! All the kids do it. They don't get of stuff down there.\"\n\"I don't want to. My mother wouldn?t want me to,? said Tommy. ?Yah! Ha! Mama?s Boy,? Jeered Billy, forgetting not to whisper loud. Miss Deering looked at them, which meant not to disturb the class. When Tomy tried to be still the feeling came stronger and stronger. He looked out the window, but that didn?t help. Only there was dirty snow, and black smoke and chimneys and ugly brick walls. It wasn?t like Still valley where you could see the foothills, except for the cotton woods along the creek bed.\nAll these things crowded in on Tommy until he couldn't stand it?even the things in the room, the wigwams and the green trees and the reared-back Indians that the second graders had painted on wrapping paper with poster paint. All at once Tommy had to get out, or he was going to bawl. He had to see mother. \nMiss Deering's voice reached out to stop him when he left his seat and went toward the door, but he went right through the sound, like wading the little canal when the current was swift. Sometimes she just let him go, but today she followed him out to the hallway where he was putting on his galoshes.\n\"Tommy, come back,\" she said. \"You know it won't do any good to go home. Your mother won't be there until five. Why won't you stay until school is out?\"\nTommy didn't answer. He went on fastening his galoshes.\n\"Don't you want to be promoted? If you keep going home every day in the middle of the class period you will not learn all you should. You will have to stay in the second grade a long time, and people will think you are dumb!\"\nStill Tommy didn't answer. It was just words that the teacher was saying. The sound of her voice beat up in his ears in waves, like irrigation water backing up against a dam. She put her hand on his shoulder, but he only weighed eighty-one pounds, and down the steps.\nMaybe mother would have a headache and would have sick leave, like she did one Saturday, when she was home all day. She pulled him in bed with her and he was warm and comfortable, almost like being in Still Valley again.\nIt was nice there, especially in summer, when the cottonwoods floated gauzy seed pods down, and when you could lie on your stomach on the bridge and fish for pretty rocks, or look into the glassy water until you could see yourself speeding upstream.\nMother's fingers were sometimes butter-gooey from making cake, and you could like to see if the setting hen had stolen her nest in the woodpile. Mother knew why a four-leafed clover had four leaves, and where God was, and why the old sow grunted instead of talking.\n\"Heavenly Father, make mother have a headache,? he prayed as he knelt down, and then almost skipped. He almost remember that she had been sick a little before she went to work. He was sure she would be home this time.\nBUT mother didn't have a headache, and she wasn't home. The furniture was there?the new pink davenport and the overstuffed chair that you couldn't put your feet on, but the house was empty. Tommy ran through it shouting: ?Mother! Mother!? so loud his ears rang when he quit, but there was no answer. \nThe little hand on the clock was between two and three, so Tommy took it down off the shelf and set with it between his knees on the linoleum. Then, because the kitchen had cold breakfast dishes on the table, and the back looked like old hens at molting time, and the bathroom had damp floors on the floor. Tommy waited and waited and cried awhile because he thought she might not come at all, and it seemed like a million years until the little hand was on the five, and she opened the door.\n\"Mommy!\" he said, and was so startled he couldn't tell what she looked like.\n\"Tommy Haman!\" she said, snatching the clock from him. \"If you touch my alarm, I'll never get to work on time.\"\nIt was then he noticed the two straight marks between her eyebrows, and that her hair was tight in little iron curls and her mouth was sticky with red stuff she used to ?keep herself up.? When she saw that he sat so till and that his mouth was dumb with the lump in his throat she hugged him and said: ?I?m sorry.? She even smiled, but her face was like the apartment when he came home. Her features were there, like the furniture, but she was gone. ?We have to hurry now-get the house cleaned, supper and to bed with you Mother?s having company-some of the girls from the plant.? \"I don't want them,\" said Tommy. \"Call them up and tell them not to come.\"\n\"Why, Tommy! That wouldn't be polite. Besides, this is your daddy's last night on swing shift, and he'll be home evenings after this.\"\nThey weren't girls, though, when they came. They were big ladies, like mother, and they sat in mother's living room and laughed and all talked at once, and sounded like the pallets when you jumped suddenly into the coop and said \"Boo!\" Tommy was shut in the bedroom and he still wanted his mother.\n\"Mother! Mother!\" He shouted until the cackling all stopped, and mother came through the slit of light from the opened door.\n\"There's a Tiger in the closet,\" he said, so she left the door open a little crack, and said \"nonsense.\"\n\"Children are certainly a headache,\" she said when she got back to the living room. Maybe Heavenly Father had answered his prayers.\nTommy's always been such a mama's boy,\" she went on, and Tommy, hearing her, winced with shame. \"You know he gets so homesick for me he just gets up and leaves the schoolroom every day just like that?nobody can stop him when he chooses any day.\"\n\"His father wants me to quit work and stay home,\" his mother continued.\n\"That would be a mistake,\" said a lady, and her voice sounded like she thought she was smart. \"He'll have a mother complex if you don't look out.\"\n\"That's just what I think,\" agreed his mother. \"Besides, I want to get a few things.\"\n\"Do you think you'll go back to the farm after the war?\"\nTommy held his breath, listening. \"I'll say not! Never a new thing, and nothing but work! I didn't know how bad it was until we moved. I finished paying for my overstuffed just the other day. Now I want to get two tables and two blue lamps?\"\nTommy's stomach hurt with disappointment, and he cried a little because he couldn't remember what his mother looked like with her hair loose and her eyes soft, but the next day he didn't come home. When his teacher came, he chewed his pencil and thought fast about the blue lumps and about her thinking he was a mama's boy. And after school, when out he went with Billy down to the five-and-ten."

They accused him of stealing a sack of food. Niels hearing them from the side of Johanna's sick bed slipped away. Ann Kristin thinking to save both him and the sick girl confesses to taking the food. Instead of freeing Niels the officers decided to take both of them, and started to hunt for the \"big Swede.\" They were saved by Jake who pretended he had also been hunting Niels. He told the officers where to go to find him. After they had gone, the girls persuaded Jake to stay and eat with them. Patty Lou transferred her anger at him to Ann Kristin, demanding to know just where she got so much food. Ann refused to tell, then Helga discovered Ann's ring was missing. That broke down the resentment Patty Lou had always felt toward Ann Kristin. So she told them that Tom Bedloe had taken their money. He had also taken her money?claiming to have given it to Elder Lewis. The two men were just starting out to find Bedloe when Helga came running for help. Johanna was dying. CHAPTER VI THE Camp of Israel was a long way from the banks of the Mississippi. A long way in time, in wearied footsteps, and in heartaches over what had been left behind. In the same crowded cemetery Johanna and Edward Lewis lay sleeping side by side. Because she had so loved the city, which to her had meant Zion, Niels and Matt had taken Johanna there, where her bones could rest in the shadow of the temple. A week later they had placed Edward Lewis beside her. Still later, they had begun the series of moves that had, two years later, placed them on the plains of Iowa not far from Winter Quarters. Twice Jake had been able to move their few belongings, and twice Matilda Lewis had put them in her own overloaded wagon. Ann Kristin was thinking of all this and much more as she walked toward her home. It was late afternoon and hot, but the heat was dry. Not sticky as it ha'been along the river. Ted Lewis, walking beside her, sighed. \"Tou should not have come with me, Ted,\" Ann Kristin told him. \"It is too much walking.\" 'Pooh. I can walk as far as any girl.\" Then he sighed again. \"I wish I was a sheep herder. That was a big band of sheep. I bet there was a million sheep in it.\" *] am afraid not quite so many. If there had been a million brambles, there would have been more wool.\" \"Have we got enough wool to make Anna a coat?\" he asked. \"Well,\" Ann Kristin looked at the mat of dirty wool in her apron, \"there is enough for a pair of stockings, perhaps. Tomorrow I shall follow the herd again. Perhaps then we will have enough for a coat.\" \"You can't go out alone,\" Ted warned. \"The Injuns might see you.\" \"But there will be more wool farther out. There were too many women following the herd today.\" \"I am going to marry Anna when Page 37 I grow up. I like girls with yellow I grow up. I like girls with yellow hair.\"\n\"That will be a long time. Anna is only ten.\"\n\"Oh, not so long,\" Ted answered wisely. \"I'm not going to be an old bachelor like Matt. He says he has enough of women. I'm not going to make an excuse. She says she is in love with someone, and is too stubborn to know it. Anyway, Becky didn't wait for him. She got married.\"\n\"Was he in love with Becky?\"\n\"Gosh, yes. He walked her to all the meetings and dances. Anyway, I have to go west before I get married or maybe I won't. I might be a freighter like Jake and Matt or even a scout like Jim Bridger.\"\n\"Does your mother say whom he is in love with?\" Ann Kristin asked, hesitantly.\n\"Who is in love?\" Ted demanded. \"I do not know. You said your mother?\"\n\"Ah, don't care if I am in love with Anna. She says it is quite safe. Golly,\" he cried suddenly, \"look at the dust. It's a wagon train. They will have the mail. Maybe Patty Lou will get her letter.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Kristin wasn't sure she wanted Patty Lou to receive her letter. That would mean she would leave them. \"Jake might be with them.\"\n\"It is a long one. Let's run,\" Ted urged.\nAnn Kristin shook her head. \"You run, Ted. Probably if you can across the coulee you can meet them.\"\nThe boy dashed away, his bare feet skimming over the dry earth. It was incredible after all the walking he had done. She watched closely. She could tell by the dust that it was a long train. Probably on its way to Winter Quarters, or perhaps even to Fort Laramie or Fort Bridger. It would bring mail and very likely more saints. It would lay over here in camp all night. Her pulse quickened. If Tom did come back and news of the saints scattered among the trail. There would be no news for her, unless she held the thought a moment, unless Tom should write to her.\nThe evening of Johanna's death, Jake and Matt had visited the trader, Willkins, seeing them had given them more satisfaction than information, for Willkins, seeing them in time, had bolted his door and fled, thereby establishing his guilt. Becky had never found him. Nor had he ever returned to Ann Kristin for his answer. The humiliation of it had left its mark.\nOf all the scars there was none so deep as that caused by the death of Edward Lewis, and none that had brought with it such deep humility. They had chosen to leave Norway, the death of her parents had not been preventable. Poverty she was learning to endure, and camping would, in some happy day, be a thing of the past; yet she would never be able to forget what she had done to her. \"Tell Evelin she can't do it. It will be too hard. To make it harder to bear, almost in last words had been to her. \"Tell Evelin not to blame herself,\" Ann Kristin was learning to trust my Maker.\"\nThe weeks had passed, Tom said. \"Pa had done a good work and his time had come. Let's honor him by working for the future, not the past. There is too much to do to spend time in grieving or regretting.\"\nMa, her eyes told Ann Kristin she would always grieve; and the girl wondered again at the depth of her love and understanding, her capacity for forgiveness. FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 39 Love of a gospel that would foster such growth grew in Ann Kristin, and dissolved the fibers of her uncertainty and self-concern. When the moves came, they clung to Mrs. Lewis. Her family accepted their presence as one more feature of the unnatural life they were leading. In the two years Matt had been with his mother only twice, briefly, and both times had avoided Ann Kristin. CIRCLING the camp, Ann Kristin approached her home. It was a sod shanty the girls had erected themselves. It was the best home they'd had for two years. It would keep them warm when winter came, if they were still here. Here, as at Camp Lewis, much of their living was done outside. Helga and Patty Lou were sitting before their shanty waiting for Kristin. Patty Lou was holding a skein of yarn over her wrists, while Helga wound it into a ball. Little Anna was toddling between the two trying to reach the thread. She was small boned like Johanna, and with Johanna's flaxen hair, but her eyes and features were much more like Niels'. They all adored her, but to Helga she was the sum total of life. She was all the lovely things Helga had lived and loved, and still hoped for. \"This is all the yarn I have,\" Helga sighed with regret, \"and I haven't any more wool.\" \"You-all?,\"\" Patty Lou corrected herself, quickly, 'you use more wool than any dozen women in camp. Why don't Kristin come? It will be evening directly, and no sign of her.\" Helga took Anna, protesting loudly, on her lap and began undressing her. \"She must have stopped to visit someone. No. No,\" as the baby tried to push off her lap, \"come, Helga will sing you a song.\" She rocked back and forth as she sang softly, \"Sof du min lilla, min alsk-ling, ar du jom?\" \"Do you reckon she is fretting over Tom Bedloe?\" Patty Lou interrupted. \"She's powerful dreamy lately. She doesn't sing any more.\" \"Ann Kristin has too much sense to be unhappy over a man like Tom Bedloe.\" Helga spoke shortly, \"I think it is something else.\" \"Do you reckon she is in love? That Bill Hooper comes here plenty often. I see him watching her when he thinks no one is looking. Do you reckon she loves him?\" \"It is quite possible. Girls her age are usually in love, if they aren't married. I thought Bill came here to see you.\" \"I thought so, too, at first.\" Patty Lou sighed. \"I won't do any complaining about it but it does seem mighty queer. Every man that comes to see me falls in love with her. I reckon I got to get used to bearing burdens.\" She changed the subject abruptly. \"Do you reckon that wagon train will ever get here?\" \"It should be here by tomorrow at the latest. That is what the scout said.\" \"That no-account Jake Nickols had better be here. We are getting mighty low on food.\" Helga looked up from the baby. \"Patty, how can you continue to take food from Jake when you don't love him?\" When she found Patty Lou did not intend to answer, she continued. \"He sent word he would be here, and he has never failed to keep his word, except when he swore to catch Tom Bedloe; but he'll do that, eventually \"S-sh. Here comes Kristie.\" Helga looked around. Anna gave a squeal of delight and tried to wiggle out of Helga's arms. Kristin stooped to kiss her. \"I can't take you now, Alskling, my lap is full.\" \"What have you got?\" Patty Lou asked. For answer Ann Kristin opened her apron and showed them. \"We heard that a band of sheep was passing so I dismissed school and followed them. All the wool nearby had been gathered, so I had to go a long way. I am going again in the morning, while it is cool. You want to go with me, Patty?\" \"Not me. If it is so far the other women haven't already picked it, I'd never make it.\" \"You are lazy?oh, I forgot. A wagon train is coming into Camp. The mail might be here already.\" \"Sure-enough?\" \"Sure-enough.\" In an instant, Patty Lou was up and away. Ann Kristin went inside. After washing, she put on a clean apron. VOUR supper is on the table,\" Helga called. \"There are some string beans. Sister Andrews brought them to pay for Danny's schooling. What do you think she said?\" Ann Kristin waited to answer. She put a slice of bread on the plate of beans. Going outside, she sat on the box where Patty Lou had been. \"What did she say?\" she asked. Breaking a crust from the bread, she handed it to Anna. \"She said how thankful she was to be in the same camp with a great lady like you, so her little crippled Danny could learn to read and write. It is we who are blessed. If you could not get pupils we would starve.\" Ann Kristin smiled at her sister's extravagant statement. \"You knit and Niels sends flour, not to mention Jake's occasional contributions. I wish I needn't charge. I could weep when I see what sacrifices parents make that their children may have a little learning.\" \"Most parents are like Sister Andrews. What makes you so restless? Are you tired?\" \"A little.\" Then she asked quickly, \"Do you know what day this is?\" \"July 10, 1846. Four years to the day since we sailed from Norway. That was a long time ago. Almost another world.\" \"Quite another world. Four years* ago we were those proud Mortensen girls. We had no thought of anything but marrying well and settling down to a well-ordered existence in the parish where generations of Mortensen?s had lived and died. Then?,\" She stopped and Helga picked up the thought. \"Then father heard the gospel, and here we are. Camp of Israel, Indian Lands, U. S. A.\" \"Since we never get mail, no one is interested in our address. Where will we be next?\" Helga's ears caught the threatened sob in her sister's voice. She saw that Ann Kristin was studying FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 41 her hand. She could use it now, but it would never look normal again. She chuckled. \"Farther west. And we were so sure our troubles would be over when we reached Nauvoo.\" She got up and went inside to put Anna in her cradle. Coming back, she took up her knitting. She suggested that Ann Kristin do the same; but Kristin was in no mood for knitting. \"Do you suppose we shall ever be married and have homes of our own? I mean real homes with flowers and gardens and pastures and cattle? And milk to drink once more?\" \"I doubt it.\" Helga's practical mind saw only the present. \"Even if we should go west to the Rocky Mountains or into Oregon, I should think the Indians would keep us living in forts. Would you mind?\" \"Mind.\" Ann Kristin turned the word about. \"Mind? I ache to get settled. Every girl wants a home and a family. What is there?but I am glad I am here and very thankful. Our lives in Loftshammar were stale and without purpose, in comparison.\" \"Hmm-m. Plenty of purpose I would say. We worked and ate and lived in houses, and went to school and directed the work of the servants?.\" \"Helga,\" Kristin interrupted, \"do you remember the stories mother used to tell us when we were children? I loved most the stories of the early Christians. Because they were true to their faith they changed the history of mankind. Do you suppose?do you think our suffering will be remembered even in a small way? Look what our people are doing. Sister Lewis for instance. She is a cultured, refined woman. She has lost every material possession except what can be hauled in one wagon. It is seven years since she left her home. She has lost her husband.\" \"Now, Kristie, let's not go into that again.\" \"She has lost everything, yet she acts as if she had the riches of the world at her feet. Even under these primitive conditions she never lowers her standards. Surely such faith and devotion will?.\" \"You are such a dreamer.\" \"But it can't be wasted effort, Helga, nor insignificant. It means more than our eyes can see or our understanding grasp. Something great and powerful will come from it.\" \"I am not interested in history. What I want is a home right now, and a family and a place where we can worship in peace.\" \"Do you know what Sister Lewis told me? Because we are not sure of the future, we must face it with full confidence. We must go forward, without fear. We must hold and appreciate each little moment of happiness that comes our way. But you needn't worry. You will have Niels and Anna.\" Helga did not answer for a moment. When she looked at her sister, her eyes were troubled. \"I could not endure having him take Anna away from me, but he has never spoken of marriage. In a year and a half he has written once.\" \"But he has sent messages and supplies by Jake. Niels was ever a man of few words. You know, Min Alskling, in Norway you would not have looked at him except as you would look on any laborer, but we are not in Norway. When you \nare not in Norway. When you are gone, I will be alone.\"\nHelga threw up her hands. \"Who could be alone in this camp?\"\n\"Many people are alone, even in a crowd.\"\n\"I understand what you mean. At home, Kristin, you had your pick of the boys. Why do you refuse the attentions of the young men here? Are you grieving for Thomas Bedloe?\"\nAnn Kristin's eyes had been turning restlessly to the prairie. The setting sun had brushed it with a bright varnish. Her glance came back suddenly to meet her sister's. \"It still hurts. I suppose that is pride.\" She got up and moved about. \"How could he have been so charming and yet so sedentful? I always ask myself that when I walk with Bill Hooper or Phil Westover. Tom seemed as sincere as they. Do you think there could have been a mistake?\"\n\"No. Matt is not the kind to jump to hasty conclusions. We know for certain Tom did not give Patty Lou's money to Elder Lewis.\"\nDUSK was settling over the prairie. Shadows lengthened, and mingled into a dusky curtain. Patty Lou had started a small fire. The smoke caught at Ann Kristin's heart. It was so long since Patty had danced. \"See what I have. My letter from papa.\"\n\"Did the wagon train get in?\"\n\"Only the mail.\" Unexpectedly she dropped to the ground and began to cry. \"Just think. My first letter in two years. He is a good writer. See!\" Pride dried her tears. \"And he sent me this. What is it?\"\nShe passed a slip of heavy green paper to them. Kristin scrutinized it.\n\"Patty, it is money. You must take it to a bank. We had similar ones in our box.\"\nPatty Lou snatched it. She turned it over and over. \"I've never heard tell of such money.\"\nKristin explained. Patty's eyes widened with delight. \"Jake it to Nauvoo on his next trip. It is going to be lonesome without you, Patty Lou.\"\n\"Without me? Why should I go clear up to Nauvoo? Jake can get my things for me.\"\n\"It will save time. You will have to go there anyway back on your way back to Alabama.\"\n\"Who said anything about going back to Alabama?\"\n\"Patty Lou Turner. Didn't you tell your father you would go home if he sent the money?\"\n\"I did not. I said I was tired of living like a woodchuck. I'm sorry if he misunderstood. This money will buy a wagon. Maybe Niels and Jake can get us some oxen. Then we can go on being uncomfortable for another right smart spell.\"\nAnn Kristin did not know whether to kiss the girl or shake her. \"You can't do it. It would not be honest.\"\n\"Why? He's my very own papa, isn't he? If he don't know me by now, like a dumb shame.\"\nThe girls laughed. \"That was so like Patty Lou. If she actually made a promise nothing could swerve her from it, but no one else was so adept at evasion. She turned their logic aside so cleverly they were left smiling. Helga's fine sense of honor was outraged. \"A fine saint you are.\"\nPatty Lou began to cry again, then, dry sobs that shook her slender body. Kristin was provoked at Helen for being so harsh.\n\"Don't cry, dear,\" she said softly.\n\"Don't you think I want to go home? Do you think it is easy to stay here? I love my family.\"\nAnn Kristin looked at Helen, and then they were crying, hugging relief for themselves and despair for Patty Lou who had cried for so long. Their tears did what their argument had failed to do. Patty Lou wiped her eyes on her apron. Holding up the slip of paper, she kissed it dramatically.\n\"Goodbye?\" She stopped short. The creaking of wheels brought them to their feet. Jake was driving into their dooryard. Behind him were three other wagons. Patty Lou looked at the driver in the first and her face paled. Jake jumped to the ground. The hand she held out to him was trembling violently.\n\"Jake?Jake?is it??\"\n\"Yes, honey. It's them.\"\n(Continued)"

VISITING TEACHING Oakland Stake (California) RUTH S. HILTON, stake Relief Society president, reported in 1944 that at the officers' meeting in connection with the 1943 ward Relief Society conference ?we suggested and urged that special meetings or conventions be held in all of the wards for the purpose of honoring and giving instruction to the visiting teachers, as well as to furnish opportunity for personal expression of problems by the visiting teachers themselves. These meetings have now all been held with several members of the stake board in attendance at each. We have heard original poems, short bits of drama, song, and speeches, all lending emphasis to the work of our visiting teacher, as well as portraying the magnitude of her responsibility. Often lunch was served, with the teacher who had given the greatest length of service as the honored guest. Our visiting teaching since the curtailment of gasoline and tires has been a real challenge to us. However, our sisters are gradually being converted to the point of view that we may change the method but 100 per cent visiting teaching is still our goal.' Gradual improvement has been shown all winter and our report for Page 44 last month (March) shows a high since the war began, with four wards having 100 per cent and four others between 90 and 91 per cent. We are happy to note a steady trend upward in our stake as follows: January 1944 ?60 per cent; February? 70 per cent; March?77 per cent.\" Young Stake (Colorado and New Mexico) BERGETTA A. COVINGTON, released in 1944 as stake president of Relief Society, reported early in that year \"that the Kirtland Ward had achieved 100 per cent visiting teaching during the past year. Our stake visiting teachers' message leader made a special effort to obtain such results in all our wards by providing exceptionally fine messages for the summer months, but the Kirtland Ward is the only ward to report 100 per cent for the full year. This success is due in part to the splendid follow-up work of the supervisor. Sister Elsie Tanner, who made a special effort to see that it was done the first week in each month. If the teachers were unable to go she provided substitutes or went herself.\" Harriet D. Foutz is now president of this stake Relief Society. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 45 VISITING TEACHERS OF THE CALIENTE WARD RELIEF SOCIETY, UVADA STAKE, who for four consecutive years maintained a record of 100 per cent visiting teaching. This picture was taken at a social in their honor in 1944. Officers in the front row, left to right, are Evelyn Anders, organist; Margaret N. Willis, secretary-treasurer; Annie S. Forsyth, first counselor; June C. Huntington, president (now Uvada Stake Relief Society president); and Arvilla Bradshaw, second counselor, who has since been appointed president with Ruby Davis as the new counselor. Sevier Stake (Utah) LETTA STAPLES, stake Relief Society secretary - treasurer, reports: \"A Summer Fun Fest, under the direction of Relief Society Stake President Myrl Brugger, was enjoyed by over 300 Relief Society sisters at the Sevier Stake Tabernacle, July 18, 1944. The auditorium was beautifully decorated with a profusion of summer flowers. Clever gold and blue programs, bearing marigolds and bachelor's-buttons, announced the afternoon's activities. \"The program included community singing, readings, guitar music, and dances. A play, 'After This What?' was given by the Richfield First Ward urging regular attendance at Relief Society meetings. Two clever song-and dance numbers were given by four young married couples of the Richfield Fourth Ward. \"Especially honored at the program was Emma Nay who had the longest unbroken visiting teaching record?67 years of service. Awards for long years of service as visiting teachers were also given to Sena Larsen. Second Ward, 40 years; Hannah Rentier, Third Ward, 46 years; Mattie C. Nielson, Fourth Ward, 44 years; Tessie Oldroyd, Glenwood, Ward, 20 years; Mae Nielson, Sigurd Ward, 35 years; Hannah Anderson, Koosharem Ward, 35 years. Individuals having perfect attendance records for one year or more were Carol Salisbury, Edith Balle, Emily Nebeker, Elvira Dastrup, and Myrtle Bagley. \"A beautiful vase of flowers was VISITING TEACHERS OF MANCHESTER WARD, SOUTH LOS ANGELES STAKE, which reported in August 1944, that for eight successive months all 27 districts had achieved 100 per cent visiting teaching by the second week of each month. Alta Boice is ward Relief Society president and Delia Wilson, the visiting teachers' message leader. presented to the Richfield Second Ward in recognition of 13 1/2 consecutive years of 100 per cent visiting teaching. Lovely vases of flowers were also given to the Boxcreek and Richfield First Wards for obtaining Magazine subscription rates of more than 75 per cent. \"The awards were made by Ivy Ashby, Maiben Thomson, and Let-ta Staples of the Sevier Stake Relief Society presidency. \"After the program, a lovely tea, carrying out a blue and gold color scheme, was enjoyed in the recreational hall. The committee on arrangements included Ruth Rowley, Marvel Dewey, and Vilda Helquist, with all members of the stake board assisting.\" Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho) IDETTA E. MERRILL, president of this stake Relief Society, reports that a stake visiting teachers' convention was held last September to which were invited the stake presidency, advisory high councilman, ward bishops, ward Relief Society executive officers, and visiting teachers. The aim of the convention was to explain the modification in funds, the change in meetings, and to increase an appreciation of the teachers' duties. The stake board presented a model teachers' training - report meeting. Stake board members representing visiting teachers gave verbal reports as the stake secretary called the districts by number. The stake message leader gave a sample lesson, and the president's message included the information regarding discontinuance of collections and the combination of report and training meetings. NOTES FROM THE FIELD VISITING TEACHERS OF IDAHO FALLS STAKE at a stake visiting teachers' convention, September 24, 1944 \"We prepared skits for the wards to present, demonstrating visiting teachers confronting the problems of (1) making friends where they were formerly not welcome; (2) solving the visiting of the out-lying district; ad (3) showing teachers ability to meet emergences. A second group of skits depicted incidents proving the value of service done by visiting teachers. ?Refreshments were served and a spirit of friendliness was enjoyed.?"

            "content": "The Salvage of Tin Is Essential Tin, used in small proportions and almost exclusively in combination with other strategic metals, is a concealed war weapon, and a deadly one. It goes into every war machine, on land, sea, or in the air. A battleship contains 76 tons of tin. The intricate machinery of a submarine calls for more than 3 tons of tin. A destroyer must have 490 pounds of tin for its electrical system alone. Every heavy bomber must have 48 pounds of tin, every medium tank 35 pounds, every Diesel engine 13 pounds. Airplane motors, cannon, machine guns, bomb sights, gas masks, torpedoes, and hand grenades, radio, telephone, and telegraph equipment?all demand tin. Tin, known among the ancients as the \"devil of the metals,\" because of its unique effect on the physical properties of other metals when combined with them, is the hidden but irreplaceable component in the alloys that go into war equipment and in the solders that hold many of the parts together.. Also for medical items tin is indispensable. The fighting man's individual morphine hypodermic syringe (syrette), his emergency sulfa ointments, blood plasma, and other medicaments are kept free from contamination in containers of pure tin or tin-coated steel. All these urgent military needs as well as essential civilian demands for tin must be met out of a diminishing supply of this metal.. Though this country has long been the world's largest consumer of tin, it has produced practically none, for workable tin deposits are almost nonexistent in the United States?or anywhere else in North America. Ever since the beginning of the war, the United States has been learning to do without tin for all but the most essential uses. Tin coated containers may be used only for those products which must be packed in tin. The use of tin has been banned for kitchen utensils, galvanized ware, toys, costume jewelry, Christmas tree ornaments, and many other items. Tin foil is permitted to be used for electrotype machines, electrical condenser, and a few other essential purposes, but none can be made available to wrap such items as tobacco, chocolate or cheese for civilians... An important factor in filling the gap is the salvaging of tin from tin cans. Billions of cans, each containing 1 per cent pure tin by weight, go into American homes each year. They are the most dependable source of tin in the Nation today... Since the launching of the tin can salvage program in the spring of 1942, collections have grown from 1,000 tons a month to 20,000 tons, or approximately 200,000,000 cans, at the present time. But the country's 8 detinning and 6 shredding plants are able to handle tin cans at twice the current rate. Two out of three tin cans going into homes are still being lost in garbage piles?a loss that the United States can ill afford.-War Board Salvage Your Tin! Page 48"

One important wartime job is to take care of what we have. A spot or stain spoils the appearance of any fabric. Commercial laundries and dry cleaners are not always available. The wise homemaker learns to care for the family's clothing and all household fabrics herself. Fresh spots are removed more easily than old ones. It is always better to remove spots and stains before washing or cleaning the entire garment. Knowing the nature of the spot simplifies the job. Two precautions should be kept in mind: first, not to destroy the surface or finish of the material, and second, not to rub so hard that any of the dye is removed from colored fabrics. If possible, it is always safer to experiment with a small sample of the fabric. Stain Removers. Stain removers may be divided into absorbents, solvents, and bleaches. Absorbents are used mainly for the removal of grease spots. Fresh chalk, talcum powder, Fuller's earth, dry starch, cornmeal, and dry cleaning powders are absorbents. In using absorbents, spread the stained fabric on a flat surface. Cover grease spot thickly with absorbent. This may be worked around gently with the fingers. Sometimes it is necessary to leave the absorbent on the spot for several hours. It is then brushed carefully. Repeat if necessary. Grease spots are sometimes removed by placing the fabric between, two sheets of white blotting paper and pressing the spot with a warm iron. Several thicknesses of paper towels serve the same purpose. These treatments are effective for fresh stains on white or light colored fabrics. It is almost impossible to brush all traces of an absorbent from dark materials. Solvents. Solvents are used to dissolve a stain. Cleaning fluids, alcohol (denatured or wood), ammonium hydroxide, ether, carbon tetrachloride, or commercial solvents with this base may be used when water fails. When using solvents, lay the material, spot side down, on a pad of cloth or white blotting paper, apply the solvent with a soft cloth rubbing from the edge toward the center of the spot. Change the pad occasionally and also change the sponging cloth as soon as it is soiled. Caution: Most all cleaning fluids are inflammable. Be careful to use them in small quantities, work in well ventilated room, and keep stopper in bottle while working. Bleaches are used in the last attempt to remove a stain. They should be applied very carefully. Javelle water, oxalic acid, potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydro-sulphite are usually more successful for bleaching purposes than lemon juice or sour milk. Bleaches will injure fabrics unless directions are followed carefully. Method to use?Stretch the stained portion of the material over the top Page  of a bowl 1/2 to 1/4 full of hot water and fasten tightly with a rubber band, then apply the remover with a medicine dropper. Be sure to rinse out all bleaching fluid with clear water after the stain has been removed. Apply the water very carefully. Clorox, a commonly known bleach, may be used to remove some stains if directions on the bottle are followed carefully. Fruit stains are removed by stretching the fabric over a bowl and pouring hot water from a height through the spot. Miscellaneous Stains: Iron Rust-Lemon juice and salt or oxalic acid made into a concentrated solution are effective. Any good commercial iron rust remover is good for white cotton or linen. Do not use for silk or colored materials. Ink?Apply stain remover with medicine dropper. A small amount of ammonia, added to hydrogen peroxide is helpful. Two tablespoonfuls of ammonia added to the hot water will produce fumes that are often effective. Heavy Grease?Rub a small amount of clean, unsalted fat on the spot and work it around with the fingers. Wash in warm water and heavy suds. Turpentine is a well-known solvent for fresh paint to use on the hands, wood or glass. Household Pests. Most pests are remarkably adaptable. They will climb high or low in search of food. Houseflies are the most common and the most dangerous of all household pests. They may be carriers of such diseases as typhoid, tuberculosis, cholera, diarrhea and dysentery. The housefly lays it eggs in decayed animal or vegetable matter. Hence, absolute cleanliness both inside and out is necessary for its extermination. All windows and doors should be well screened. Ants are not actually harmful but their persistence is annoying. Sodium fluoride powder (poisonous), is quite effective, but keep it away from children and pets. Some sprays are also helpful. Mice. To avoid mice, guard against their entrance, by closing up all holes and cracks. The wooden snap trap is the best mouse exterminator. Cheese is not as popular with mice as freshly fried bacon, oil sardines, or peanut butter. Moths. A preliminary cleanout will da much to prevent moths. A good spray or some moth preventive should be used before storing. Store in moth-proof bags or closets or cedar chests. Cockroaches feed mainly on dead animal matter and cereals. Try to obtain expert advice. A mixture of equal parts of fresh pyrethrum and sodium fluoride is very effective. Bedbugs are no respecter of persons. Powders and sprays are effective if introduced into the places where the bugs are hidden. Mosquitoes like houseflies are carriers of disease. Their extermination should become a community project. Elimination of all breeding places is necessary. Expert advice may be obtained from a county agent or the state board of health. House rats carry disease. They are destructive and are filthy in their habits. Cutting off the rat's food and water supply is the surest way of {Continued on page 64) LESSON DEPARTMENT"

Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, April 3, 1945 Objective: To study the major events numbered in the bright and dark years in and about the city of Nauvoo the Beautiful. THE bitter sorrows born in the struggle to establish the center stake of Zion in Missouri, served to throw the cause of the Church into sharp relief against political weaknesses of the State and Nation in which the kingdom of God was to rise. Little did the mobs of Missourians realize how they indirectly helped to \"bring about Zion.\" The persecution which these unscrupulous ruffians, in fiendish delight, heaped upon the saints perfected a unity of purpose among the followers of the Prophet which God had sought, but failed to get completely during their rise to power in the days of Kirtland. For within a period of but little more than six years, a marshland, fit but for an abiding place of malarial diseases, leaving naught to recommend it but its site upon a beautiful horseshoe bend in the Mississippi River, was to shine forth a city, the like of which the State of Illinois had not known. A city graced with a temple of God whose white stones and spires were to catch the eyes of travelers for miles up and down the Father of Waters. Nauvoo the Beautiful it was to be called. The saints, now bound together in deeper love through common suffering, were to work this wonder as evidence of the fruits of the kingdom. The winter of 1839 found from ten to twelve thousand Latter-day Saints in a most pitiable condition upon the lands of Illinois. The hospitable citizens of that State donated thousands of dollars in provisions Page 51 and clothing to these suffering people. With the arrival at that early hour they laid the corner stone of the temple and heard the fulfillment of the revelation so given by the Prophet, much to the chagrin of their enemies who had declared, under oath, that these words of the Mormon leader should go unfulfilled.\nWith the coming of the summer of 1839, the future city of Nauvoo began to take shape above the marshy land. Blessings of the Lord, both temporal and spiritual, came abundantly. In August, seven apostles departed for England, from which place was to come a rich harvest from the missionary work begun by Heber C. Kimball and those associated with him in the opening of the British Mission. As a result, some three thousand souls came to Nauvoo by July 1, 1841. At that time, too, Brigham Young, who had been in charge of a permanent shipping agency in Great Britain, arrived with some of his brethren.\nWhile the missionaries to England were abroad, the Prophet Joseph left his followers and made a trip to Washington to present before the officials of the National Government, there, the grievances of the saints sustained during their expulsion from the State of Missouri. Such had been the publicity of the crimes committed that the whole country had been made aware of the \"Mormon problem.\" They now, too, held \"a balance of political power in the State of Illinois\" came the cry. It was upon this trip that the Prophet met and talked with President Van Buren, who at first listened to the story of the Church but, later, in fear of his own political life turned a deaf ear to justice saying, \"Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you, and if I take up\n\nLESSON DEPARTMENT 53 for you, I shall lose the vote of Missouri.\" In disgust, the Prophet left the \"city of politicians.\" His trip was not in vain, however, for during his journey he spoke to large audiences about the cause of Truth. Edward Hunter of Chester County, Pennsylvania, later a presiding bishop of the Church, came into the fold as a result of hearing the message delivered by the Prophet at this time. With the winter of i840-'41 came a most liberal charter granted to the city of Nauvoo by the legislature. So broad were its provisions that great good for the Church and its people was seen by the Prophet. A day or two after this instrument of government went into effect, on February i, 1841, a university and a Nauvoo Legion were organized. The Prophet became the head of the latter, holding the rank of lieutenant-general. Newspapers sent reporters to cover the news of the \"Military Prophet.\" Joseph Smith's fame now had spread to two continents. Publishers sought his word for printed distribution. The result was a short account of the founding and rise of the Church, as written by the Prophet, in which, succinctly, were put the \"Articles of Faith,\" the subject of the Relief Society theology lessons for the past three years. As one reads these, he is impressed with their simplicity and direct expression of the power of godliness. \"We believe\" they state. Ours is a faith that leads on to an understanding of the will of God; not a religion of the mind that is shaped from the touch-and-go interpretations of his word by men. The year 1842 found the Prophet and his people at the height of their prosperity. The Times and Seasons, a noted publication of the Church, carried the gospel truths abroad to the world. On March 17th of that year, the Relief Society for the women of the Church was organized. Everywhere, the peace of beautiful homes and thriving industries made Nauvoo a haven of rest for the twenty thousand souls who had come to Zion?a blessing and joy this was to the heart of their Prophet, who prophetically, though, had seen the bitter darkness that lay just ahead for him and his people, even as he then stood radiant in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the thickly darkening clouds. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word\" which has been written especially for our life in this day. 1. Were the Prophet here today what questions of a spiritual nature might you have liked to ask him? Read sections 129, 130. Perhaps, in part, some of the questions raised by the class will be answered. The thought here is to have the teacher and class come a little closer to the natural and direct way in which the Prophet enlightened his people. Read the two epistles written by the Prophet to the saints, enjoying them much as you would a letter. These were written during the Nauvoo period when he was forced to go into hiding because of his enemies. Here is as near a personal visit with this man of God as we who were not privileged to know him in life can come (Doc. And Gov. 127, 128)."

Hinckley For Tuesday, April 3, 1945 \"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God\" (Matt. 5:9). Objective: To show that enduring peace between men and nations, in the home and abroad, will come only through the adoption of the precepts of the Master. TO be able to compose differences, reconcile those at variance, promote harmony and happiness is a rare and precious gift, and this is within the reach of the humblest. We may not be able to write a book, accumulate a fortune, distinguish ourselves in the field of statesmanship or politics, we may not startle the world with inventions, but we can all contribute to the peace and happiness of those about us, and, in so doing, we become real peacemakers. Such indeed are the children of God. Whosoever cherishes hate in his heart, whoever makes it easier for men and women to suspect each other, to mistrust each other, that individual, regardless of his profession, is fighting against peace. Whoever is hard to live with in the home, whoever is a promoter of strife between man and man, whoever creates discord, discontent, and misunderstanding, whoever preaches selfishness, whoever fosters prejudice is a disturber of peace. On the other hand, if we are peacemakers, if by what we say, by what we are, by what we do, we preach the \"Gospel of Reconciliation\"; if we promote peace in the home, peace in social circles, peace between nation and nation, then we are making common cause with the Prince of Peace. His gospel is the gospel of peace. Enduring peace between men and nations, in the home and abroad, will come only through the adoption of the precepts of the Master, and through magnifying these precepts by actually applying them in our daily lives. \"Peace on earth\" is not to be established by congress and parliament, nor by any group of international representatives, peace cannot be legislated into existence for it comes from within. The only way to build a peaceful community is to build men and women who are lovers and makers of peace. Each in of your Father which is in heaven, dividual holds in his own hands, in a... (Matt. 5:44-45) measure, the peace of the world.* Ruskin said: **Do you ask to be *'Love your enemies, bless them the companions of nobles? Make that curse you, do good to them that yourself noble and you shall be.\" If hate you, and pray for them which you asked to be called the \"children despitefully use you, and persecute of God,\" cultivate the divine gift of you; That ye may be the children making peace and you shall be. *See discourse of Elder John A. Widtsoe, Conference Pamphlet, October 1943. Literature New Testament Lesson 7?New Testament Epistles Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, April 17, 1945 IT is somewhat difficult for folk today with widespread mail service, the press, and the radio at their command, to visualize how severely limited were the means of communication in the long ago. In these days, gospel messages may be broadcast with electric speed over all the world. With the Savior and his apostles, gospel teaching was largely restricted to places within walking distance, and to conversing with the few who cared to listen. It was a kind of home-to-home missionary service, with occasional opportunities to give the divine message to larger groups, attracted by the marvelous works and words of the Master.\nLater, when Paul was carrying forward in the realms of Greece and Rome, he wrote epistles to help him spread the truth. These gospel letters were far more, however, than ordinary communications. In letters, they carried greetings and cheer and courage to the different branches of the Church and, at times, to individuals. They sometimes dealt also with specific problems that troubled the saints. But more than this, they were masterful interpretations of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As such they hold a high place in the world's great literature.\nThe epistles found in the New Testament, written not only by Paul, but by other evangelists, have classic qualities. Though addressed for the most part to specific congregations, they ring with truth for people of all time. Outside the gospels, no other religious works have been more often quoted in the Christian world; nor have any had a more profound influence in guiding action along ways of righteousness. Most of the epistles preserved for us in the New Testament were produced by Paul. How many other gospel letters this ardent missionary wrote, we do not know. Through the busy, troubled years of his ministry he was constantly speaking?portraying the gospel with fervor and clarity before varied types and classes of people from common folk to kings. A hint of his eloquence comes to us in the complimentary remark of King Agrippa: After Paul, as a prisoner, had pleaded the cause of Christ before him, the King said, \"Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. And Paul replies, \"I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds\" (Acts 26:28-29). His persuasive eloquence vibrates in the epistles preserved for us. These gospel letters reveal not only a clear mind, but a fervent soul. They are the blossoming and the fruitage of years of devotion to the cause of truth, which, with direct commission from the Savior, he had made an intrinsic part of his own being. It was dearer to him than life itself. Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, in effect, that sermons should not be written until they had been spoken many times?this to round and polish them as pebbles are smoothed and perfected by rolling with the waves on the beach. Paul doubtless often voiced the profound truths, and the reasons for his belief in Christ, before he wrote his epistles. When he did address\" one of these gospel letters to saints he had helped to bring into the fold, he was ready for such written expression. He talked to them fervently with his pen; and in doing so, he often expressed great truths with literary finish and force. Following are a few of his many lines that bear out this statement: For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation (Romans 1:16), For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 6:23). The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God (Romans 8:16). Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good (Romans 12:9). And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power (I Corinthians 2:4). Let all things be done decently and in order (I-Corinthians 14:40). If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable (I Corinthians 15:19). O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? (I Corinthians 15:55). But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ \"(11 Corinthians 11:3). Be not deceived: God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap (Galatians 6:7). 'Taul,\" says Dinsmore, \"had a rare power of condensing much wisdom in a sentence. That is why preachers find him so rich in text.\" LESSON DEPARTMENT 57 Not all parts of his epistles, it is true, are of the highest literary standard. At times, as critics have pointed out, his sentences are not close-knit; and in places he lacks directness and simplicity. Yet, one quality is never lacking, and that is sincerity. The great evangelist spoke and wrote under the inspiration of the Master, who had called him to his mission to help save mankind. It is this spirit that gave undying vitality to his words of truth and light as he himself so well said: 'The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\" Under the impulse of the poetic spirit, Paul rises at times to unsurpassed literary excellence. An outstanding example of this is the poem ?for such it may well be called?on Charity* (or Love), I Corinthians, chapter thirteen. Read its beautiful lines aloud, thoughtfully: Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity. Observe the perfect balance, the cadence of the lines in this gospel poem. It has the qualities of Hebrew lyric, with something of Grecian polish added. Note also such picturesque expressions as \"sounding brass and tinkling cymbal,\" \"suffereth long and is kind,\" \"vaunteth not itself; is not puffed up.\" Mark too, such upbuilding spiritual suggestions as \"seeketh not her own,\" \"thinketh no evil,\" \"rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.\" With clarity and charm the lofty theme is developed to its simple impressive close. Its literary excellence is well described in these words of Thoreau: \"Perfect sincerity and transparency make a great part of beauty, as in dewdrops, lakes and diamonds.\" Other writers of New Testament Epistles, though producing fewer of these than did Paul, still have bequeathed to us some precious gospel letters. Of these we have in the New Testament: one by James; two by Peter; three by John; and one by Jude, the brother of James. To James, the apostle who was cruelly slain by the tyrant Herod, Latter-day Saints will ever be deeply indebted. It was he who wrote the *Some translators prefer the word love. Either form is beautiful. lines that inspired a boy, Joseph Smith, to seek the Lord in prayer. \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed\" (James 1:5-6). Acting on this sound advice, Joseph took the first step that led to the restoration of the true gospel of Christ in these latter days. In the Epistle of St. James will be found other inspired lines. A few of them follow: Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above (James 1:17). Let every man be swift to hear, slow'' to speak, slow to wrath (James 1:19). Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only (James 1:22). What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him? (James 2:14). Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? (James 3:11). And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace (James 3:18). Good counsel, given in a sweet spirit, characterizes the Epistle of James. One feels in his lines the heart of a man who has tested the truths of life, and is giving them forth as a father talking in plain, but kindly words, to his children. In the Epistles of Peter, likewise, we get closer to the man himself. His gospel letters reveal a vigorous leader in the cause of righteousness. With forthright sentences, tempered with wisdom and love, he lays down fundamental principles in his trenchant lines of counsel: But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you (I Peter As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby (I Peter 2:2). Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation (I Peter 2:12). And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins (I Peter 4:8). But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (II Peter 3:18). Echoes of the Gospel of Saint John are found in the three epistles written by this \"beloved disciple.\" He re-emphasizes the manifestation of God through his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ. He impresses the truth that Jesus was sent to propitiate, not only the sins of the Jews, but the whole world. He stresses also the truth that, if we walk in the light of the Savior, we are in fellowship one with another and with God. From these lines of John's gospel letters we can catch something of his spirit: He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now (I John 2:9). He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love (I John 4:8). LESSON DEPARTMENT 59 Perfect love casteth out fear (I John 4:18). For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one (I John 5:7). I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth (II John 1:4). Discussion and Activities 1. (a) What incidents of the New Testament show the modes of travel in those days?

            "content": "Social Science Modern Applications of Ethical Principles Lesson 6?Honesty, the Core of Character Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, April 24, 1945 Lesson link: The discussion last time centered around truth and its perversions. It was shown that truth is the very framework of ethics, but that because of abuses; such as ignorance, lying, cheating, hypocrisy, expediency, et cetera, the highest morality is frequently never reached. Lesson aim: To analyze the ethical aspects of character and to show that honesty is at the heart or core of it all. THE last hundred years or so has \" been described as the age of science. During this period, more than at any other time, man has been occupied with the discovery and analysis of facts. And in this quest for factual truth man has been largely successful, for he has greatly extended the boundaries of his understanding, making possible, thereby, a speedier progression and a higher morality. But facts alone are not enough. In spite of the world's technological advancement, it is doubtful that it is any more happy or any more moral than before, as we have shown in an earlier lesson. Knowledge means power; but power used without principle is a curse rather than a blessing. The misapplication of facts is as often to blame for the ills of man as is the ignorance of facts. Science cannot substitute for virtue. The right application of knowledge and the right use of power are far more important than knowledge and power in and of themselves. Technical education without adequate ethical orientation is of questionable value. It is time for man to realize that character building is the most important business of life. Character Versus Reputation It was shown last month that truth is frequently abused and distorted in an attempt at self-benefit. The highest morality depends upon our ability to strive for: Truth instead of falsehood Intelligence rather than ignorance Information in place of confirmation Straight thinking in place of fantasy Sincerity in place of indifference Certainty along with sincerity Intellectual honesty instead of self-justification. Analytic searching rather than dogmatic defending Conviction in place of skepticism Confidence without arrogance or self-pity Self-interest without cheating Humility without self-depreciation Statesmanship rather than politics Honor rather than expediency Genuineness rather than hypocrisy Principle rather than profit Whenever truth becomes neglected or perverted in any of the ways discussed (or any other way for that matter) morality suffers. Dishonesty is the willful abuse of truth, whether it be on the covert, the verbal, or the overt plane. Some people are dishonest because they won't think straight, others because they lie, and still others because they cheat. But most dishonest individuals offend on all three of these levels covering up deceit with more deceit. Because of this all-too-common tendency to cover up or hide the real self from others, there is frequently a fundamental difference between a person's character and his reputation. Character is what we are, while reputation is what we seem to be to others. If everyone was entirely honest, character and reputation would be identical; but since all are not honest, man is easily fooled and injustice is perpetuated. A Sunday School teacher assigned the twenty-fifth chapter of St. Luke to be read for the following week. When the class reassembled he asked how many had read the assignment, and about one-third of the hands went up. \"Well,\" he remarked to the startled group, \"you are just the ones I want to talk to for my subject is on lying, and there isn't any twenty-fifth chapter in St. Luke.\" Several years ago Eddie Cantor offered a $5,000 prize to high school students for the best essay on peace. Out of the thousands of entries a young man was selected and taken to New York City to be honored and awarded the prize. But before the end, it was discovered that he had copied a large proportion of his essay word for word from a magazine article published a few years earlier. Needless to say, he went home in disgrace and without the prize, all because he had failed to understand the meaning of plagiarism. These are only two of many examples that could be given to illustrate the existence of basic dishonesty in society around us. Studies reveal that quite a high percentage of our young people copy and cheat in school. But the problem doesn't stop there. Even a cursory self-analysis along with an examination of society at large will reveal that cheating is not confined to school nor to the young alone.\nThose who seek to build or protect their reputation by deceit will do well to remember that, \"nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad\" (Luke 8:17).\nThe Role of Honesty in Character\nHugh M. Woodward (Humanity's Greatest Need, pp. 137-150) following an arrangement by Mrs. Noenetta Richardson, summarizes the major qualities of character by comparing them to the construction elements of a building. The aim or motivation for building the temple of character is found through self\nunfoldment and service to humanity. The temple is located on the mount of service beside life's highway. The great sustaining pillars which support the entire structure are self-respect, self-effort, self-control, and self-poise. The foundations of the temple are honesty, trustworthiness, sincerity, and courage. The floor is made up of perseverance, temperance, frankness, and humility. The doors for entrance into the temple are faith, a passion for the truth, an interest in all life, constant industry and effort, and a wakeful conscience. The windows of the temple, which represent the attitude of a righteous soul, are a genuine interest in life, a sympathetic understanding of others, tolerance, and love. The color scheme is cheerfulness blended with refinement, kindliness, gentleness, and gratitude. The crowning feature of this temple of character is made up of charitableness and altruistic service.\nSome of these features of character we have already discussed in earlier lessons, and others will be examined on later dates. While the scheme obviously is not perfect as it stands, it is at least suggestive. With close study, it may seem desirable to add additional qualities of character and mentioned here or to rearrange the order and relative position of those given. But, perfect or not, such a scheme should at least prove helpful in any character analysis.\nTo the writer the most significant thing about this temple of character is the including of honesty in the foundation. It would be impossible to even conceive of character without honesty, for any structure founded on deceit and falsehood is founded upon sand and rather than rock and must inevitably fall. Furthermore, a careful scrutiny of the other factors of character listed here will reveal that they are all related to basic honesty. Honesty, then, may be considered as the core of character. Character Building The roots of character reach back into infancy and early childhood. Character building starts soon after birth and continues throughout life, as the individual learns and absorbs the moral codes of those about him. But the first impressions are the most important, for they arrive when the personality is most pliable, and they set the stage or determine the focus for later ones. As the twig is bent the tree is inclined. Parents sometimes fail to realize the tremendous responsibility that is theirs in shaping the characters of their developing children. Aside from their frequent neglect of moral instruction in the home, impression and example are often of the wrong sort. It is likely that we teach more by what we are than by what we say, and for this reason many children go wrong. Righteousness is contagious, but, unfortunately, so also is unrighteousness; and too many parents are in the second class. Sometimes children are woefully neglected, sometimes they are bossed and shoved around in the spirit of ownership without any training in responsibility and self-control, and sometimes they are actually encouraged by their parents to lie or cheat or in other ways be dishonest and unsocial. Children are a blessing, a gift of the highest order. But with every gift comes a responsibility, and, unfortunately, there are many modern parents who fail to realize this. Irresponsible parenthood is back of most of the immorality of the day. While the home is the first and the most primary nursery of character, it does not stand alone. The church, the school, and other groups or persons that the individual contacts and from which he absorbs culture are also involved. Morals do not come ready-made, and the making of morals is the responsibility of us all. Character building requires instruction and example of the right kind; respect for individuality and personality; opportunity for responsibility and self-control; and all of this from parents, teachers, and associates who come in daily contact with the young. Whether our children develop into immoral expedients or honorable characters depends, in a large measure, upon us. Adult ethics (or lack of ethics) and juvenile delinquency are intrinsically related. \"God Give Us Men\" Abraham Lincoln represented the type of manhood so much needed today when he said, \"I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true; I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to what light I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right; stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong.\" It is this type of resolution and courageous honesty that forms the core of character. Too many people in the modern world lack the strength that comes from honor, for LESSON DEPARTMENT 63 they have no honor; too many are Machiavellian, living for profit rather than principle. There must be no compromise with right and truth. What we need today is men and women who know the right and who have the honesty and the courage to live it, even when others aren't looking; men and women of fidelity, integrity, and honor. In conclusion let us say with J. G. Holland: God give us men! A time like this demands Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands; Men whom the lust of office does not kill; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will; Men who have honor; men who will not lie; Men who can stand before a demagogue And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking; Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog In public duty and in private thinking; For while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds. Their large professions and their little deeds Mingle in selfish strife, lo! Freedom weeps. Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Defend the statement that character building is the most important business of life. Have we departed from character emphasis in this age of science? Discuss pro and con. Why is factual knowledge alone insufficient for righteousness. 2. What is the difference between character and reputation? Why is there so often a difference between the two? What are the three levels of dishonesty? Give illustrations of dishonesty on each level. Why is a dishonest person so often dishonest on all three levels? Discuss. Is anyone one hundred per cent honest? Discuss. 3. Here is an actual case that might be used for debate or lively discussion: A young man in returning home from a party about three o'clock in the morning accidently awakened his mother, who then asked him the time of the night. He answered, \"Plenty after twelve\" but said it in such a way as to make it sound like \"twenty after twelve.\" Technically he told the truth; but actually, by intention, he gave the wrong impression. The question is, was he lying? Think of other examples of \"technical honesty\" and decide whether the question of honesty is to be judged on the basis of words or intended meanings. 4. Name the major elements in the temple of character outlined in the lesson. If you have a blackboard available it might be well to try your hand at drawing the temple and labeling ' the various parts. Discuss the entire scheme and see if there are any suggestions for adding other elements or rearranging those listed. Show how honesty is central and basic in it all. Could the other qualities exist without honesty? 5. Why are the habits and attitudes learned in the early years of life so deeply engrained in the character complex? Why are parents so important in the process of character building? Name and discuss some of the mistakes parents make with reference to character training of their children. Discuss the places of the church and the school in character formation. 6. Read aloud and then analyze Holland's poem \"God Give us Men.\" Find examples of honesty in the lives of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and other great men, and then show how their honesty has paid them dividends. In looking ahead to the next lesson show how the virtues of love, service, and tolerance would be largely negated without honesty as a starting point.

I studied eugenics, genetics, and zoo, I've reaped information wherever I go. I delved through psychology and child care. Vitamins, diets, clothing, and hair, Punishment, teething, and education, Corrective guidance and sanitation. My schedule told me just what to do, I fed him at six, at ten, and at two. A bath at nine-forty then sleep 'till eleven, And his cod-liver oil came strictly at seven. He was in bed by six?although he might shout, The door was closed tight and the lights were turned out. With such competent training, I can't comprehend Why it's all forgotten before he turns ten. He's the subject, the object, and source of my wrath. It's a full day's job to give him a bath. He crawls through the windows and slides down the stairs. His falsetto soprano rends the air. He bangs the door and swings on the gate. He kicks up the flowers, and comes to meals late. He teases, he kisses, he stumbles, he shouts, He questions, he answers, he argues, he doubts. I've finally concluded that it's useless complaining. For boys will be boys in spite of their training.

Work Meeting COMBINATION APRON AND SEWING BAG ANY woman who sews, darns, mends, or does fine needlework, crocheting or knitting will appreciate an apron with pockets to hold her thimble, scissors, and tape measure, and keep her sewing clean, too. This combination apron and utility bag* is very convenient and practical. Materials required?1 1/6 yds. Fabric, preferably heavy, washable print or solid color, \"Yi yards cord or ribbon for draw string and to tie envelope accessory holder, bias binding, two wooden rings, beads or buttons. To make?Cut two pieces of material 16 3/4 inches by 22 inches for bag (A) (Illus. 1). Seam the bottom and sides. Turn down 1 3/4 inches at top for hem. Stitch hem, then stitch 3/4 inch from edge of hem to make a Ya inch casing to enclose draw string. Leave seam on outside of casing open for draw string. Cut one piece 10 1/2 inches long by 22 1/2 inches wide for apron part (B) (Illus. 2). Make 1/4 inch hem on each side. Sew lower edge to inside of back of bag, stitching Y inch below (C) hem stitching. Make a second stitching over hem stitching (E) and through apron to hold apron in place and to cover raw seam. Make pocket (D) 4 1/2 inches by 13 1/2 inches finished with 3/4 inch hem at top. Stitch to back of bag and over lower edge of apron, allowing top of pocket to come to stitching (E). A small, envelope-style folder may be made (Illus. 4), the pocket to hold small scissors, skeins of floss, buttons, thimble, etc., the strip of outing flannel to hold needle and pins. When the apron is pinned and C and tied with ribbon or cord attached at point H, a very compact sewing equipment case results (Illus. 5). This may be kept in small pocket in apron. Band for top of apron and tie strings may be cut from remaining material. When one stops sewing, the apron top may be folded down into the bag, the draw strings pulled, and presto, one has a utility bag to hang on one's arm to take places, or to hang by the draw string in a convenient place ready for future use. Further suggestions on aprons will appear in the March issue of the Magazine. *This apron design was originated by Ruth T. Oscarson, first counselor in charge of sewing, Granite Stake Relief Society Board, Salt Lake City, Utah. ILLUS.

It's a sort of filling station for a boy of nine or ten; It's the family trysting place with apple pie; And the smell of hot, brown gingerbread upon a frosty night Is a memory you'll cherish 'till you die. It's the room where you'll find mother, where little folks can come To tell their troubles, and have broken hearts made whole; Oh, a house can be most anything, a mansion or a shack, But the home without a kitchen is a home Without a soul. Forward, Without Fear Dorothy Chpp Robinson CHAPTER 7 AGAIN Ann Kristin was out following the trail of the sheep. She was a long way from camp, and alone, and because of that the sack she carried was nearly full. She was glad to get away from the others. There were so many new people in camp, and so much happiness. Newcomers were hunting relatives and friends. Letters were being read and discussed. Women, the more fortunate ones, were bargaining eagerly for new foods to relieve the monotony of their diets. Patty Lou was still going around in a daze trying to be with Jake and her family at the same time. There had been a happy gathering in the Mortensen dooryard the evening before. Around the campfire, while the Turners ate, a story had been told and retold. \"How did you come? How did you know where to come? Who told you where to find me?\" \"Jake did,\" Jinny, a younger sister, had answered, \"and you-all are even prettier than he said.\" Her letter had been months reaching them. After his first unreasoning anger at the thing that had taken his daughter away, Mr. Turner had fallen to wondering. He suspected she had no intention of returning home. It had taken him some time to arrange the transfer of money to her, then he had begun to investigate. He was curious about Page 98 the power that could keep a girl like her among strangers. \"So,\" the story had ended, \"we came on to Nauvoo. Everything we own is in these three wagons. Brother Matthew Lewis baptized us the same time he did Jake.\" Patty Lou turned slowly to face Jake who sat beside her. Her eyes filled with tears of happiness. Jake, frightened by them and the solemnity, tried to grin. \"You-all ready to quit being cagey and marry me?\" \"Jake Nichols. You are blind as a badger. I've been counting on it right along.\" \"Will you-all mind?\" \"I love doing what pleases you.\" \"Make her give a definite promise,\" Mr. Turner advised, and the others smiled their agreement with him. \"I am not inferring this time,\" the girl turned serious. \"I am so happy with the way the Lord has blessed me, I will do anything to show him.\" Forgetting the presence of the others, Jake answered, \"Oh, Patty Lou, you good-for-nothing Honey Chile. I been waiting for this moment all my life, and that's a right smart spell.\" Nestling one hand in his, the girl gave her father the other. Looking about to include them all she said simply, \"You are my family.\" Niels' eyes had said the same thing to Helga. Little Anna had awakened, and she passed from her father FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 99 to Helga and back again many times. Niels had a wagon and ox team now, and a cow he had lead all the way from Nauvoo. Being a property owner had given a new proud lift to his shoulders. Only Ann Kristin was alone. So very much alone, she told herself as she picked snags of wool from the brush. Matt Lewis had come in with the wagon train but she had not seen him. For all she knew he might have brought a wife with him. Even so, she was deeply affected by what the Turners had said of him. He was a true son of his father. There would never be any doubt of his integrity, nor of his devotion to the cause. The girl who married him would be lead inevitably into the celestial kingdom. Perhaps he wasn't married, but would go on tomorrow with the freight. He was working with Jake between the settlements and Fort Bridger. SUDDENLY Ann Kristin realized she was miles from camp. In all directions there was nothing but hot sky and brown prairie. A tremor of apprehension went through her. There might be Indians lurking near. She had been following a dry water course, now she walked to the top of a short rise and looked about. To the southwest a spiral of dust was rising as if in warning. She dropped abruptly to the ground and watched from behind the brush. She would have to crawl back down and find a hiding place?if there was a hiding place. It was a single horseman, and as she watched her fear vanished. It was a white man. Probably a scout, or some one following the sheep, for he seemed to be looking for some one. Several times he rose in the stirrups and looked about. Ann Kristin rose and waved. Instantly the rider saw and came galloping toward her. It was Matt Lewis. He stropped his horse and sprang to the ground. \"What do you mean coming out here alone?\" he demanded. \"Don't you know there are Indians? You might get lost.\" \"Is that what you came out here to tell me?\" \"Someone had to tell you.\" \"If you came out here to quarrel-.\" \"Who's quarreling? You?.\" They both stopped abruptly. He lifted his hat and ran his finger through his damp hair. It was the same hat he had worn the first time she had seen him. \"You are thin,\" he said unexpectedly. \"Why shouldn't I be? We walked from Montrose. Your mother helped haul our things. We were fortunate not to have to carry them.\" \"Next time there will be room to ride. I have a wagon and team of my own now. Jake and I are hauling freight.\" \"Yes, I know. Jake told us.\" For the life of her she could think of nothing else to say. Her torn faded dress, her worn shoes, the bag of greasy wool embarrassed her. She was holding on to the bag with her bad hand. It was no longer withered but it would always be a little stiff. \"Did you??\" she began, \"No,\" he read her thought, \"but it is no longer important. I found out all I needed to know.\" He had been holding the bridle reins. Now he looped them over his arm. His gaze wandered a moment as if he were searching for words. '1 found your money box/ he said, abruptly. \"You found it!\" He nodded. \"Not the money, naturally. One of the saints had bought it from Bedloe. It was a good strong box and evidently he could not resist the price it would bring. How he got it off the boat we probably will never know, nor how they managed to open the trunk without arousing suspicion. We knew it was yours by the initials of your father carved on the inside. Jake and I visited Wilkins. We made sure he did not see us coming this time. Under pressure he confessed. Bedloe was the leader of an organized band of thieves. Some of them, like himself, posed as saints to more easily win the confidence of the unsuspecting immigrants. But we did not find Bedloe.\" Then Ann Kristin knew, too, that the affair was no longer important. What was important was her changed attitude, her increased strength. The sudden knowledge that men like Matthew Lewis could always be trusted. She could touch suspicion and still know faith, one could accept trials and still know peace. She could be friends with Matt. \"You know now that I signed the paper innocently?\" Instead of answering Matt looked at her. His gray eyes were reddened by wind and sun. Dust lay a hard veneer over his features, but the hardness of distrust was gone. He spoke simply. \"T have always loved you, Ann Kristin, from that first moment on the wharf.\" Color drained from her face. She let the wool fall. He stepped closer. \"Could you?I'm not polished like Bedloe, I have nothing to offer you.\" \"You have everything,\" she raised her eyes to him and wondered at her own temerity. \"You have the Priesthood, heritage, honor, and a great kindness. Perhaps with you. Matt, I could forget the selfishness of my past.\" With a whoop of joy he caught her up and swung her about as he had his mother. Then he set her down abruptly and almost timidly took her in his arms. Later, from the pocket of his faded flannel shirt he took a small object wrapped in buckskin. \"Mother's ring,\" she cried out and reached for it. \"Where did you find it?\" With one hand he held her back. His grin reminded her of the day she had seen him teasing his mother. \"This is mine. I got it from Wilkins the same night he took it from you. I gave him five dollars and defied him to refuse to sell. I think he knew then I was suspicious. He didn't dare squawk.\" \"Oh, my dear, as scarce as money was?and you have kept it all this time.\" \"I knew this hour would come. I had to know it.\" He slipped the ring on her finger and then held her hand in both of his. She looked at the ring and tears brightened her eyes. \"All our lovely things are gone. Except this.\" \"But you have something much better. Strength and fortitude, and understanding.\" His compliment was so similar to hers she started to laugh. His smile FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 101 widened and then they were both laughing. Quick spontaneous laughter that brought back the lines of youth to their faces. He tied the wool on the saddle and they walked back to camp, savoring the minutes together. There was so much to talk about and their hands kept touching. \"We will be married tomorrow' he said at length. \"Mother will be very happy. She sent me to find you. You can stay with her until we get settled, or would you rather be with Helga?\" \"With your mother, then you can be with both of us between trips.\" \"I am not sure how long the trips will last. Much depends on what the body of the Church does. We can't settle here permanently. The saints are leaving Nauvoo and vicinity as fast as they can dispose of their property, and get wagons or carts to haul their few belongings. All must be gone by spring. Those in power have decreed it, which makes it much harder to sell anything. Especially land. Now Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri are petitioning the Federal Government at Washington to refuse us permission to settle within the confines of their boundaries.\" \"But where can we go?\" \"Brother Young is asking permission to settle in the Far West. That would entail much planning and more suffering. If there is a place of rest we will find it. I hope it will be next year. Take mother, for example. It is seven years since she gave up her home. In all that time she hasn't really been settled.\" \"BUT the trouble of the saints was soon forgotten. They talked as young people in all ages have talked. The past was forgotten and the future was not yet upon them. Only the present was theirs. So short a present. A mile from camp two men came riding hard out of the west. Matt stopped and his hand went to his gun. Even when he saw they were white men he did not relax. \"What news?\" he asked as they pulled in their lathering horses. \"Plenty. Brother Young is behind us. He wants to meet all the men.\" They were off again, and now the future was upon Ann Kristin and Matthew. The old sickening apprehension swept over her. His lips closed to a hard straight line, and his steps quickened. As they entered camp, they saw the buggy approaching. They stopped until it passed. Brother Young and two other men were in it. \"Go on,\" Ann Kristin told him. \"I?ll take the wool home. You can tell me later.\" Without a word he hurried away. Holding to the bridle reins she led the horse past tents, shanties, and wagons. Before her own home she tied the horse to a wagon wheel and removed the wool and saddle. There was no one around. Even the Turners were gone, except Jinny and she soon left. \"Why don't you-all come to the meetin\"?\" she asked. \"Everybody is goin'.\" Ann Kristin refused. She felt the necessity of fortifying herself for Matt's return. If the news were bad ?but she closed her mind to it. Perhaps the meeting meant they could settle in the Rocky Mountains, or even stay here. That would be wonerful, She took up her knitting, but as time passed her fingers moved faster and faster. Surely, surely, the Lord would not try them longer, but why didn't Matt come, or Hel-ga, or some one? When she could stand the suspense no longer she got up and moved about. She was too tired to walk. Succumbing to a sudden whim she decided to dress up and go to the meeting. From a trunk she took the dress she had worn the day she left the River Maid. The one that had made her appear \"over-decorated.\" She had not worn it since that day. She shook it out and ran a cold flatiron over it. The shoes were there, too, and the hat. She arranged her hair as it had been. When she had finished she surveyed herself in the small mirror she had. What she saw was not too reassuring, but such things as wrinkles and coarse rough hands were minor annoyances. Remembrance and expectation supplied what poverty and primitive conditions failed to grant. The transformation was complete even to the ring on her finger. For a moment she looked at it, then raised it to her lips and kissed it softly. Gathering her skirt in both hands she started for the meeting. \"Kristie.\" \"Oh,\" she dropped her skirt. Matt was standing in the doorway. His eyes lighted at the bridal picture before him, but love could not entirely erase the bleakness from his eyes. She moved quickly to him. His smile faded. \"Is it a mob or an order?or do we stay here?\" she asked breathlessly- \"Neither. It is war. War with Mexico.\" \"But what has that to do with us? Surely after the way we have been refused homes?.\" \"the Government would not expect us to help protect others' homes? Yes, it expects just that, and it is our country, Kristin. Brother Young is here with an army man to get recruits. Jake and Ezra have volunteered.\" \"But?but we are to be married. We have been unhappy so long.\" Matt stepped inside. He put his arms about her shoulders and drew her close. He tilted her chin so their eyes met. Her hat fell off but neither noticed. \"Let me explain, dear.\" \"Yes?but, oh Matt, not now. Not when you have work and?.\" \"I must go. Try to understand. An older man, Niels perhaps, can do my freighting. The army pays seven dollars a month for privates, besides the clothes issued. I was a top sergeant in the Nauvoo Legion. I am hoping Captain Allen will give me a rating. If I go, other young men will go.\" \"How many do they want?\" \"Five hundred. Think what seven dollars a month coming to five hundred of our homes could mean.\" \"But war! Life is ours now. You can't throw it away now. War is brutal and savage. There are Indians, and Mexico, where is Mexico? Matt, I may never see you again.\" \"Yes, it may even mean that. Even so, we have nothing to fear. The future is all ours.\" \"I want the present. Matt, don't go. Don't ask me for another sacrifice.\" \"Where is your strength, your faith?\" FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 103 \"1 haven't any strength. I haven't any faith. I don't want any. I want you.\" For a long minute he held her close trying to still the trembling of her body, but he said nothing. She laid her face against the rough cloth of his shirt. When she raised her eyes to him, the youth and gaiety were gone from them, \"I am all right now/' she said quietly. \"When do you go?\" \"Tonight. Now.\" 'Tonight?\" \"We must be in Council Bluffs by the sixteenth. It will take hard marching to reach there by then.\" \"And the others?\" \"Niels and Helga, Jake and Patty Lou are being married by Brother Young. They wanted to send for you, but I wanted these few minutes with you alone.\". -But-but-.\" \"There is no time for that for us.\" He took her hand and slipped the ring from her finger. Then he put it back. \"Our lives are like this ring. They are not to be lived in a straight line from one year to another, but in a circle, from eternity to eternity. There is no end to them, so we shall never be apart, not days, nor deserts, nor Indians can separate us for long. 1 will be back.\" After a moment she answered, \"I know you will. I'll go to your mother. And you will come there, wherever our home is.\" The clear note of a bugle came to them. With a prayer in her heart and a smile on her lips she watched him stride away. She turned quickly then to put together her few belongings. Niels and Helga would want this cabin. She and Sister Lewis would go on together without fear. She whispered the last aloud. THE END FEBRUARY Leone E. McCune Ghostlike February, In your tattered gown. Hovering sad and lonely, Trailing up and down. You drift in the hollow 'Neath the moonlit hill. You shriek around the corner, Weep upon my sill. I hear you at dawning; Moaning sad and low, Wandering like a lost soul. Knows not where to go. You will follow winter When the sun rides high, And pussy willows unfold To a clear blue sky. NOTES FROM THE FIELD Vera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for \"Notes from the Field\" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, Pg 104- MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS Australian Mission JUNE CANNON ORME, recently released president of Relief Societies of this mission, wrote September 14, 1944: 'The work of the Relief Society is greater now than ever before within the mission. With the strain of this present time weighing heavily upon the women of the mission, the lessons and work outlined by the General Board is more and more appreciated. The constant visits and need for home life by servicemen from many nations is being met by the women within the mission in a most admirable manner. The mission home, alone, gives relaxation to literally scores each month. Many of the sisters are doing their best to relieve the situation by opening their own homes, and have done so for many months. It is a wonderful labor and a very happy work. We appreciate more than we can ever tell the contact we have with the sons of so many mothers at home. Ninety-nine per cent of those mothers in Zion can rest assured that their sons are clean before the Lord; this same thing can be said of those mothers who have daughters in the services. We get to know them very well in their visits, we have them living and eating and praying, studying and relaxing with us, and their Page 104 attitudes and their worth speak well for the homes from which they come. The groups they form in advanced bases and the difficulties they surmount to form those groups is a living testimony of the fine homes from which they have come. Their devotion and desire to make contact with the Church upon arrival is a healthy sign. It is impossible to write an individual letter or history concerning each because they come and go so quickly, but such sons and daughters speak well for the women of the Church who are their mothers. I do not wish to depreciate the brethren who are the fathers in any way, but I am speaking only as a woman and knowing the program of the Relief Society, I think it is good, once in a while, to view the fruits of those who belong to this society.\" California Mission MRS. GLYDE BOOTHE, president of the Laguna Beach Relief Society, wrote recently: \"Laguna Beach is a very picturesque little city, situated on the shores of the beautiful blue Pacific. The hills form a wonderful background, with lovely homes trailing to the upmost top of them. \"We were organized September 6, NOTES FROM THE FIELD 105 ALEXANDRIA RELIEF SOCIETY, TEXAS MISSION Missionaries Lewis R. And Laura M. Jenkins are in center, front row 1942, with 13 members; today we have 14 members and 13 subscriptions to TheWe are fully organized. In 1943, we held a bazaar and made $105.50; in 1944, we cleared $300 at our bazaar. We start the first of the year and make certain things each month; for example, January, pot holders; February, aprons; March and April, dish towels; May and June, baby clothes; July, luncheon cloths; August, scarfs; September and October, pillow cases; November, miscellaneous. In this way our sewing has been a tremendous success. All credit goes to the members and the wonderful helpers I have.\" Texas Mission LAURA M. JENKINS, returning short-term missionary, brought to the General Board, during 1944, the accompanying picture of the Alexandria Relief Society, and a history from which the following excerpts are quoted: In the five years since organization of this Relief Society in 1938, we have organized a Singing Mothers' chorus, have canned six hundred cans of fruits and vegetables; have given bazaars; put on rummage sales; given box suppers; made candy and sold it, standing on the street corners, for ten cents a bag, until we raised approximately $300. When sugar was rationed we were given special permission to solicit various business houses, and raised $700 in this way in 1943. With this $1000, matched by the Church, we purchased a six-room residence for a meeting place. Throughout the five years, there have sometimes been from five to six women meeting regularly, and more often two and three; there have even been times when the president was alone. There have been four presidents of this organization: Sisters Melhus, Viola Armond, Rhoda Mae Jones, and Bertha Wehner. AUSTIN RELIEF SOCIETY, TEXAS MISSION President Ruth Paris is standing in the back row, second from left. We now have a fully organized society with a membership of seventeen.\" La Verne Walsh, secretary-treasurer of the Austin Branch Relief Society wrote in August 1944: \"Early this year our Society held a rummage sale and a bazaar the proceeds from which totaled approximately $125. We contributed $25 to our Church Building Fund, and it is a source of pleasure to our Relief Society that we have never failed to donate a part of the proceeds of every project to this Building Fund. We are holding two work meetings a month this summer, and these are devoted to working on articles for our next bazaar. \"In accordance with the Church Welfare Program, we have given much of our time to quilting, and this year have completed two quilts and have quilted one for a member. The quilting for members is one of our projects for the year. These quiltings are always enjoyable affairs, since we combine them with covered dish luncheons, and when the spirit of love, and friendship, and co-operation is added, then we have treasured memories in addition to a wonderful work well done. We should like, also, to voice our appreciation to the wives of the army and navy men, for giving their time and their talents to our Society.\" Northwestern States Mission TN April 1944, before her release as president of the Relief Societies of the Northwestern States Mission, Edna H. Bennion submitted the accompanying picture and following statement: \"With the growth of war industries, many Latter-day Saints have come to the Northwest to work. Through the efforts of the missionaries a number of branches of the Church have been organized. In many places, they have started with NOTES FROM THE FIELD 107 RELIEF SOCIETY OF VANPORT, OREGON, NORTHWESTERN STATES MISSION (NOW IN PORTLAND STAKE) a Sunday School and a Relief Society. Such a Relief Society is the one at Vanport, Oregon, a housing area just outside of Portland. All of the women in the organization live at Vanport and many of them work in the Kaiser shipyards where their husbands are employed. They meet at 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning so they can be home in time to have dinner ready for their husbands as they come off day shift and the women go on the swing shift. They are all doing their bit to win this war, but they haven't lost their desire to meet at Relief Society. The Vanport Branch has grown to a complete organization of happy, faithful saints.\" This branch has since been transferred to the Portland Stake. Central States Mission THE following reports from five branches of this mission were all submitted during the forepart of 1944. Their mission Relief Society president is Lydia Ann M. Romney. May Kipp, president of Dodge City (Kansas) Branch Relief Society, wrote March 14, 1944: *'We were organized in the fall of 1940 with myself as president and Sisters Pauline Parsons and Louise Davis as counselors. We held our first bazaar a week before Christmas with very good success. We took in $35 which was an achievement as it established the bazaar idea within our group until we now sell handmade articles to many regular customers. We are selling a good many baby clothes at this time, and we, as a group, heartily endorse the idea of holding bazaars and keeping ready-made garments on hand. We have also made a good many surgical dressings and also cookies for the U.S.O.\" Ada Van Dam, president of the Fort Sill (Oklahoma) Relief Society, submitted the following statement prepared by Mary G. Matheson: \"Fort Sill is the largest field artillery school in the United States. DODGE CITY RELIEF SOCIETY, CENTRAL STATES MISSION (Picture taken in 1942). Many Latter-day Saint men are stationed here and consequently\" a goodly number of wives have accompanied their husbands from Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Arizona and other states. \"We have organized a splendid branch, and the attendance at our Sunday School and the evening sacrament services rivals various Protestant gatherings held on the post. The services are conducted by army personnel as there are no civilian members located in this vicinity. With more of our brethren being stationed here, the number of vives coming out has increased, and many expressed their desire for a Relief Society. Ada Van Dam and Olive Phillips were instrumental in organizing our group under the direction of the Central States Mission. 'The first meeting was held in September 1943, with about ten sisters present. Our membership now averages twenty-three at every meeting. As we have no chapel of our own, our meetings are held in various members' homes once a week. \"We are probably the youngest group, in age, of any Relief Society in the Church. Many of our sisters are attending out here for the first time in their lives. The majority are newly married and are about twenty-two years of age. \"The lessons as outlined in Theare being followed and we all take turns instructing. It is a grand group, and the association with each other is doing much for all of us who are away from our homes in these troubled times. The branch is our mainstay, and we look forward eagerly to each meeting. \"Our Relief Society is responsible for beginning and continuing to hold socials once a month for all Mormons here. The young fellows in the army await anxiously the announcement of the next social. We had a Christmas banquet. New Year's Eve party, Valentine dance, and are planning another dance for March.

Paxman, a counselor in Wichita Branch (Kansas) Relief Society, wrote April 5,1944: I've been meaning to express appreciation to you for the wonderful Relief Society lessons we've had this year. Everyone has commented on how fine they are, and they have all enjoyed them, especially this winter. I've been teaching the Bible literature lessons this past year and every one has been a joy to prepare. The material in all the lessons is handled so well that I'm sure it accounts for the increased interest and attendance at our meeting. At home I rather thought the Relief Society was for the older women, but I find I was mistaken since being active in the organization here. Though our membership is comparatively small we've accomplished a great deal. We've quilted one quilt; made two wool afghans of crocheted wool blocks made from old dresses and suits, which we donated to the Red Cross for convalescent soldiers; had a victory garden from which we sold the produce and canned for members; held a rummage sale this winter which netted us $65 profit; redecorated the two rooms at the Church used by the missionaries; and other things. On March 17, we held a covered-dish supper and program at the church for all members of the Church and friends in commemoration of the 102nd anniversary of the Relief Society. RELIEF SOCIETY OF LITTLE ROCK BRANCH (ARKANSAS), CENTRAL STATES MISSION The officers, President Bessie Wilhite and Counselors Mary G. Wiggins and Lanoi Rowe are delighted with the good attendance which has been increased by wives of servicemen. The General Board has certainly done a magnificent piece of work in making the Relief Society program so timely and interesting to women all over the Church. We've found that the Relief Society has been an excellent missionary in this branch in getting nonmembers of the Church interested. Several of our Relief Society members do not belong to the Church as yet, but we feel sure they will soon.\" Maye Housley, secretary-treasurer of Oklahoma City Branch Relief Society, wrote last April: \"Commemorating the Relief Society anniversary, a banquet was given March 18 by the Priesthood of our branch in honor of the Relief Society members. It was held in the Venetian Room of the Y. W. C. A. The Relief Society colors of blue and gold were used in table decorations. The theme \"Memories\" was carried out in the program. Our president is Dagmar Patterson, and counselors are Pearl Anderson and Grace Cullimore.\" A copy of the artistic printed program accompanying the write-up indicated that the entertainment included special musical numbers, a one-act play, and dancing. {To he continued) SHE LAUGHS AT MIRACLES Mabel Jones Gabbott She laughs at miracles who never baked a pie, Nor watched her oven anxiously, with wistful eye, Who never lifted golden crusts with tender care, And wafted heavenward a silent, grateful prayer. Repairs An Amateur Can Make Chile P. Don us \"A hole is nothing at all, but you can break your neck in it.\"?Austin O'Malley \nNOW is the time to get your tool kit ready. You, no doubt, will have many occasions to use it before the repair man comes around again. Take an inventory of what you have, to see if you can find the following: hammer (two sizes), screwdriver, a pair of pliers, a three-cornered file, a cross-cut saw, folding rule, small can of machine oil, scissors, jack knife, awl, rubber force pump 'plumber's friend', nails, screws, tacks, scraper for removing old paint, pipe wrench, friction tape, auger, turpentine, putty, plastic wood and paint brushes in good condition. You may need additional tools, but the above list is a good beginning. Good tools are a good investment. They are now very scarce, so it pays to take good care of what you have.\nElectrical Repairs?Caution. Remember that live wires are dangerous. Avoid handling electric cords, switches, etc., with wet hands. If you are repairing a wall outlet or switch, remove the fuse in the circuit.\nWhat to do when your lights go out?It may mean a blown-out fuse which indicates there is something wrong with the electrical equipment or the manner in which it is used. The fuse is a safety valve for the electrical system. It consists of a link of soft metal which melts and opens the circuit when too much current passes through the wires. If it fails to operate, the wires in the walls would become overheated, char the insulation and possibly cause fire.\nFuses must never be tampered with. Keep all electrical equipment in good repair and avoid overloading the circuit.\nHow to replace a fuse. First, find the cause and remove it. The blown-out fuse will have a cracked or blackened \"window.\" Disconnect the lamp or appliance responsible. Touching only the fuse, grasp it by the rim, unscrew it. Screw in a new one and close the switch. Never use pliers. If you are timid about handling fuses, pull the main switch, usually located near the fuse box. Buy only fuses which carry the laboratories' inspection label. Remember, the proper rating of a fuse is determined by the size of the wire to be protected. Keep an extra supply of fuses of the proper rating on hand at all times. Your power company will give you all the necessary information.\nFaucets. The most common repair any home owner can make is to repair a leaking faucet. First disconnect the water supply. Grasp the faucet handle firmly in one hand, using the wrench in the other to unscrew the nut around the faucet. A piece of cloth or paper inserted between the nut and the wrench protects the faucet from bite-marks. When the faucet handle comes out, bring with it the defective washer, unloosen the screw at the center of the washer, using a screwdriver. If the screw should stick, apply a few drops of oil and give it a few taps. When replacing the new washer, buy one, turning the dull side toward the supply pipe. Replace the screw on the handle shaft and tighten nut. Composition washers may now be purchased which serve for both the hot and cold taps.\nSinks and Toilets. In order to repair the valves by which water enters and leaves the flush tanks of toilets, one needs to study the inside mechanism of the tank. It is very simple. Any plumbing supply house will be glad to show you. Any one can learn to use a \"plumber's friend\" or suction plunge. This handy tool is indispensable for clearing sluggish drains. The ball should be half submerged and worked up and down. Drains should be cared for when the first signs of clogging appear. Sometimes it is advisable to use a commercial flushing chemical. If so, always follow the direction on the can very carefully.\nLeaky Pipes need a plumber. Temporary menders of pipes: putty, cement, friction tape or adhesive plaster wound round enough times usually stop the leak. These are only temporary measures, however, and will not last long. If the water pipe becomes frozen never apply a blow torch. The sudden heat may burst it. Apply cloths soaked in hot water. This method is slow but perfectly safe. Become familiar with the water system in your home so you will know how to turn the water off in case of an emergency. If a leak in the ceiling occurs, first, shut off the water supply; second, take an awl or ice pick and bore a hole through the ceiling where the water is dripping and relieve the plaster of the load above. This has saved many a large plastering bill.\nYour gas pilot. If the pilot goes out close the main gas shut-off valve.\nTry to do this with a piece of fine wire. The flame may be too small. If so, increase it by turning the adjusting screw to the left.\nSticking windows are unnecessary. Check the runways for signs of wear and lubricate by rubbing them with paraffin or candle grease. Secondly, examine the adjustable \"stop\" strips which hold the sash in place, they may need a little loosening. Third. If the house trim has been recently painted be sure to remove any paint that might have dried between the sash. If a door squeaks put a little machine oil on the top of the hinges. Swing the door back and forth in order to get the oil to run down the hinge pin. Repeat if necessary.\nA broken table leg can be mended with a dowel pin glued into holes bored into each section of the break. In order to do this, holes will have to be made in each of the broken pieces. These holes should be less than one-third of the diameter of the leg and about one and one-half inches deep. The dowel should be as long as the holes. Sometime chair legs become loose. If the legs are bolted on, tightening the nuts may be all that's needed. If they are screwed on, the frame may be tight enough by driving the screws in farther with a screw driver or resetting them. Fill the holes with glue or plastic wood before resetting. If the rungs in a chair become loose, one of the best methods of repair is to use metal rung fasteners which are sold at hardware stores. These are inexpensive, hold firmly, and are simpler to use than glue. These fasteners are hammered into the rung and when the rung is replaced they lock in firmly. Before attempting to glue (Continued on page 128) LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 8?A Period of Prophecy Dr. H. Wayne Diiggs For Tuesday, May 1, 1945 Objective: To establish the test of a prophet and to study events that prompted the words of the modern seer, Joseph Smith. IN the days of ancient Israel the Lord made clear the way in which his people might know his voice. To Moses came the word, \"There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee. Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God. For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do. The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. But the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken? When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shall not be afraid of him.\" (Deut. 18:10-15, 19-22). The words of a true prophet will come to pass. Not since the days of the apostles in the meridian of time had the Lord raised up a prophet according to this pattern, until, upon that spring morning in the year of 1820, when the young Joseph Smith put to a Page 113 test the power of godliness. From that day on, for a period of some twenty-four years?the remaining time of mortal life allotted to this Prophet of the Lord?there lived among men one accepted of God, worthy to receive his word in opening the dispensation of the fulness of times. Within that short quarter of a century, there lived a modern seer whose contact with the Almighty was so close that the very whisperings of his voice were unmistakable.\nWhat were the words of this leader of mortal Israel, and how did he deliver them? Were any of his associates ever present during the times revelations came? How would they know he was truly \"in the spirit\" and not obsessed as a \"charmer of wizard\"? What of his countenance, his voice, under such visionary experiences? As for the supreme test, when he spoke in the name of the Lord did the thing of which he spoke ever come to pass within the lives of those who heard? These and dozens of similar questions will flood the mind of an earnest seeker after truth today, just as they did when Joseph the Prophet himself walked among men.\nWe do have the answers to these and many other questions like them now; first, in the recorded words of the men and women who lived with and knew the Prophet intimately; and second, in the unfailing and literal fulfillment of many of his prophecies within the lives of those who heard them uttered.\nWithin the limited words allotted for these lessons, it is impossible to include even a hundredth part of the many facts now on record which bear testimony of the divine calling of Joseph Smith. We must therefore include but a few more widely known and readily appreciated about the Prophet's way of receiving revelations, as well as some of the timely predictions he gave which now we can look back upon with wonder.\nFor an account of the Prophet's appearance we may turn to the words of Parley P. Pratt: \"President Joseph Smith was in person tall and well built, strong and active, of a light complexion, light hair, blue eyes, very little beard, and of an expression peculiar to himself, on which the eye naturally rested with interest, and was never weary of beholding. His countenance was ever mild, affable, beaming with intelligence and benevolence; mingled with a look of interest and an unconscious smile, a cheerfulness, and entirely free from all restraint or affection of gravity; and there was something connected with the serene and penetrating glance of his eye, as if he would penetrate the deepest abyss of the human heart, gaze into eternity, penetrate the heavens, and comprehend all worlds.\n\"He possessed a noble boldness and independence of character; his manner was easy and familiar; his rebuke terrible as the lion; his benevolence unbounded as the ocean; his intelligence universal, and his language abounding in original eloquence, peculiar to himself?not polished?not studied?not smoothed and softened by education and refined by art; but flowing forth in its own native simplicity, and profusely abounding in variety of subject and manner. He interested and edified, while at the same time, he amused and entertained his audience; and none listened to him that were ever weary with his discourse. I have even known him to retain a congregation of willing and anxious listeners for many hours together, in the midst of cold or sunshine, rain or wind, while they were laughing at one moment, and weeping the next. Even his most bitter enemies were overcome, generally, if he could once get their ears. (Doc. and Cov. Commentary, pp. 18,19).\nFrom the book Stories About Joseph Smith the Prophet, pp. 166-168, compiled by Edwin F. Parry, we read the following, describing the manner in which the Prophet looked when receiving and dictating a revelation: \"The early day Apostle Parley P. Pratt has left on record the Prophet's mode of giving revelations. Elder Pratt and some others called upon Joseph respecting some evil spirit manifestations which they had observed in a certain branch of the Church. Their desire was to know what might be done to banish the evil. While these brethren were with the Prophet he inquired of the Lord about the matter. After we had joined in prayer in his translating room,' writes Elder Pratt, 'he dictated in our presence the following revelation: (Doc. and Cov. 50). Each sentence was uttered slowly, and very distinctly and with a pause between each, sufficiently long for it to be recorded by an ordinary writer, in longhand. This was the manner in which all his written revelations were dictated and written. There was never any hesitation, reviewing, or reading back, in order to keep the run of the subject; neither did any of these communications undergo revisions, interlining or corrections. As he dictated them so they stood, so far as I have witnessed; and I was present to witness the dictation of several communications of several pages each.\"\n\"Commenting on this description of the manner in which revelations were given to the Prophet, the History of the Church [Vol. 1, page 173] has this to say: 'This statement of Elder Pratt's is true in a general way, and valuable as a description of the manner in which revelations were dictated by the Prophet; and needs modifying only to the extent of saying that some of the early revelations first published in the \"Book of Commandments\" in 1833, were revised by the Prophet himself in the copy of correcting errors made by the scribes and publishers; and some additional clauses were inserted to throw light upon the subjects treated in the revelations, and paragraphs added, to make the principles or instructions apply to officers not in the Church at the time some of the earlier revelations were given.'\"\nMore, too, was given by this Prophet of the Lord than the revelations recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. Joseph was also known as a seer. Because he possessed this rare gift, he could foretell the coming of great events. Possibly the one event most widely remembered, of which he spoke is the prophecy concerning the establishment of the saints in the Far West. Here is a prophecy which came to pass within the lives of many who heard it uttered.\nAgain from the Stories About Joseph Smith, pp. 113-118: \"Joseph Smith's Journal, as contained in the History of the Church [Vol. V, pp. 85-86], has this entry under date of August 6, 1842: 'Passed over the river (from Nauvoo, Illinois) to Montrose, Iowa.... [had a conversation with a number of brethren in the shade of the building on the subject of our persecutions in Missouri and the constant annoyance which has followed us since we were driven from that state. \"? prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease, and some of you will live to go and assist in making settlements and build cities and see the saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.  \"?Among those present when this prediction was uttered was Elder Anson Call, who has left on record additional details respecting this remarkable prediction. He says that in the shade of the building mentioned was a barrel of ice water and the men were drinking it to quench their thirst on that hot August day. The Prophet warned the brethren not to be too free with it. What follows is in Elder Calls own words: \"With the tumbler still in his hand he prophesied that the Saints would yet go to the Rocky Mountains; 'and,' said he, 'this water tastes much like that of the crystal streams that are running from the snowcapped mountains.' \"I had before seen him in a vision, and now saw, while he was talking, his countenance change to white; not the deathly white of a bloodless face, but a living brilliant white. He seemed absorbed in gazing at something at a great distance, and said 1 am gazing upon the valleys of those mountains.' This was followed by a vivid description of the scenery of these mountains, as I have since become acquainted with it. \"Pointing to Shadrach Roundy and others, he said: 'There are some men here who shall do a great work in that land.' Pointing to me, he said: There is Anson, he shall go and shall assist in building up cities from one end of the country to the other, and you' (rather extending the idea to all those he had spoken of) 'shall perform as great a work as has been done by man; so that the nations. Of the earth shall be astonished; and many of them will be gathered in that land and assist in building cities and temples, and Israel shall be made to rejoice.' \"It was impossible to represent in words this scene, which is still vivid in my mind, of the grandeur of Joseph's appearance, his beautiful descriptions of this land and his wonderful prophetic utterances as they emanated from the glorious inspiration that overshadowed him. \"The subsequent history of the Latter-day Saints attests the fulfillment of that remarkable prediction.... That part of the prophecy relative to what Anson Call would do in the settlement of the valleys of the mountains,... Was literally fulfilled also. When Call came to Utah he first located in what is now Davis County. In 1850 he settled in Little Salt Lake Valley and also in Parowan. He then moved to the northern part of Utah, but was called to take charge of a colonizing company to settle in Pauvan Valley. In 1851 he assisted in founding Fillmore in Millard County. In 1854 he established Call's Fort; and in 1856 LESSON DEPARTMENT 117 he was sent to Carson Valley, Nevada, on a colonizing expedition. In 1858 he returned to Utah and in 1864 he was colonizing in Colorado and southwestern Utah.\" For him who would know the truth of God's promise given in Deuteronomy concerning a prophet, there stands today as solemn witness the Church of Jesus Christ.. Its members, the Latter-day Saints, bear testimony by the thousands of the fulfillment of God's word through the instrumentality of the modern Seer and Prophet Joseph Smith. If this man stood alone in a knowledge of the power of godliness upon the threshold of that day in the spring of 1820, there now has come a great host to join his company. After more than a century, an ever-swelling multitude of human souls affirm quietly, but with deep conviction, that the voice Joseph never forgot had put words in his mouth from heaven, both true and eternal. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word\" which has been written especially for our life in this day. 1. How can a permanent peace be established? Read carefully section 87 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Note the date of this prophecy as compared to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. The teacher should make full use of the notes following this section as found in the Doctrine and Covenants Commentary. Read the general notes found on page 1009 in the Doctrine and Covenants Commentary concerning Judge Stephen A. Douglas. Study in the following books will add enrichment to this lesson: The Introduction to the Doctrine and Covenants Commentary; Stones About Joseph Smith the Prophet compiled by Edwin F. Parry; and The Prophecies of Joseph Smith and Their Fulfillment by Nephi L. Morris. The teacher might well assign to each of several class members to be prepared with one story concerning the prophetic utterances of Joseph Smith. Let the year's work end on this note: At this, the end of a year's study concerning the early history of the coming forth of the Church, how more deeply are you ready \"to know that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God\"? Visiting Teaching Messages Sources of Strength?The Beatitudes * Lesson 8?Blessed Are They Which Are Persecuted for Righteousness' Sake Elder Bryant S. Hinckley For Tuesday, May i, 1945 \"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven (Matt $: io). \"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.\" (Matt. 5:11-12) Objective: To show that those who courageously stand for righteousness are often the victims of persecution, but such persecution is often the pathway to spiritual growth and those who stand firm under such persecution are heirs to the kingdom of heaven. Literature New Testament Lesson 8?Revelation of John the Divine (A Rhapsody of the Millenium) Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, May 15, 1945 ISAIAH in the Rhapsody of Zion Redeemed,\" visions with ecstatic hope the coming of the Messiah. This prophetic masterpiece, created when Israel was in travail, brought promise of relief and redemption through a Savior of mankind. John, the beloved disciple, banished to the lonely Isle of Patmos, was given, by the risen Christ, a vision of the millenium. Like Isaiah, he portrayed in rhapsody, what his exalted soul saw and felt. Only through such a blend of lofty types of literature, could he rise to the majesty of the theme.\nRhapsodic writings were in the mode of those days with Hebrews and early Christians. To impress burning messages of truth, or visions, those of prophetic spirit would sometimes fuse drama, lyrics, odes, oratory, and other forms of literature into a unified expression of their theme. The result was what Dr. Moulton has aptly called a rhapsody.\nIn the study of this type of Hebraic literature, one should remember that it is a central theme the author would impress. One must first get the spirit and meaning of the whole. This gained, it will be easier to understand the parts, so far as they will yield to our finite understanding.\nIt is hardly possible that all, or any of us, can understand the spiritual significance of every line of Isaiah or Revelation. Nor is it fruitless to be over-analytical of these or other masterful works of literature. As Dean Baliet, in cautioning teachers against such practices, put it, \"One cannot get at the meaning of sorrow by making a chemical analysis of a tear.\" Our leaders have often advised against our delving too much into the mysteries. Let these unfold in the Lord's own good time.\nOur part, now, is first to get the major message of the Revelation of John the Divine. A reading of this sacred scripture as a whole, with prayerful heart, will surely bring this to us. Every part of the prophetic book brings out directly or indirectly the living truth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer and Ruler of the World; and that those who are faithful in living the gospel as he taught and lived it, will partake of the glories with him in the millenium. Necessary limitations of this study permit only an overview of the sacred book, with an inlook into some of its impressive imagery and stirring lines. *Isaiah, chapter 49 to end. The vision opens with John seeing the Savior in power, and receiving his words of council to be passed on to the seven churches of Asia. In essence, it is stern but kindly admonition for them to forsake evil, hold to the truth, and be ardent for righteousness. \"Behold,\" the prologue closes, \"I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches\" (Revelation 3:20-22). An impressionistic vision of heaven follows. \"It takes...\" says Dr. Moulton, \"the form of three symbolic pictures passing one into the other like dissolving views.\" First, Deity supreme is manifested \"on a. Throne surrounded by a rainbow,\" while all grades of authority and all forms of life move in a ceaseless round of adoration. Then a book sealed with seven seals becomes visible in the hand of enthroned Deity\" (Modern Reader's Bible, page 1708). None, it is felt, can unseal the mysterious volume; but a promise comes that the Lion of Judah shall unseal it. Then appears not a lion, but a Lamb: and as the Lamb takes the book, \"ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands\" voice their praise of him in unison saying: Worthy is the Lamb... To receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea.,, heard I saying. Blessing and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever\" (Revelation 5:12, 13). After this song of adoration comes the breaking of the seals of the mysterious book. And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse: he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say. Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.... (Revelation 6:1-8). These were the four famed horses and horsemen of the Apocalypse signifying. Captivity, War, Famine and Death. How often since the days of this vision of John, have these elements of destruction gone forth to conquer, to fight, to dole out a pittance of food to the starving, to spread death! How tragically applicable is this dramatic picture to our war-torn world today! LESSON DEPARTMENT 121 The fifth seal broken, John \"saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony that they held: And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.\" One can sense here the feeling of John himself in the shadow of death, as he thought back of the martyrs for Christ, and those that yet would suffer death for his gospel. Yet the beloved Apostle looked beyond the clouds and the wrath of God. With the breaking of the sixth seal, comes the opening of destructions upon the world. And while the earth quakes and mountains and islands are moved out of their place, and men, high and low, hide themselves in dens and rocks, John sees the protecting angels holding back the destructive forces until other angels shall place the saving seal on the foreheads of the servants of God. The Revelation continues: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.... They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;.. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes (Revelation 7:14-17). As these buoyed up hearts of suffering saints of those earlier days. They have brought comfort and courage to the righteous of all time. When the seventh seal of the book was opened, \"there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.\" The vision continues: And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings and an earthquake. And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound (Rev. 8:2-6). Another dramatic portrayal follows of the woes that came upon the earth. Hail and fire, a darkening of the sun, smoke from the bottomless pit, locusts, scorpions, earthquakes and other plagues and calamities, spread terror and destruction. And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels. And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ....\" (Rev. 12:7-10). Satan does not cease his wicked work. In form of dragon and beast he reappears to lure men, to make them fear and worship him. He wars on the saints, overcomes them 'and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues and nations.. ' (Rev. 13:7)?all save those whose names are \"written in the book of life.\" John continues: And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth (Revelation 14:1-3). Following these and other lines of exaltation, descriptive of the pure in heart, comes a scriptural passage dear to every Latter-day Saint. And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. Saying with a loud voice. Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters (Revelations 14:6-7). Following these precious lines, prophetic of the restoration of the gospel of Christ in these latter days, come other oft-quoted words of scripture. Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them (Revelations 14:13). Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe (Revelation 14:15). After this is the vision John saw of the pouring out of the 'Vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.\" Destruction is meted to those who \"have shed the blood of saints and prophets,\" those who have \"blasphemed the name of God,\" and upon others steeped in sin. \"Babylon The Great, The Mother Oi Harlots and Abominations Of The Earth\" feels the fierceness of God's wrath: In flaming words (chapter 18), her fall is depicted: And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing,... For in one hour is she made desolate. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her\" (Rev. 18:19-20). In the light of terrible happenings today, it is not too difficult to visualize what John saw in vision nearly two thousand years ago. Triumph of righteousness follows destruction. Satan is bound. The millenium is ushered in. A new Jerusalem is portrayed in all its splendor? scorning down from God out of heaven.\" Christ reigns as \"King Of Kings And Lord Of Lords.\" Truly, in the Revelation of John the Divine, we have one of the four master Books of the Bible. From a literary viewpoint, it rises to the great heights of Deuteronomy, Job, and Isaiah. Milton, whose living spring of inspiration was the Bible, said of Revelation It is a majestic image of high and stately tragedy, shutting up and intermingling her solemn scenes and acts with a sevenfold chorus of hallelujahs and harping symphonies. LESSON DEPARTMENT 123 Ample illustrations of the appeal of its soul-stirring lines and its wondrous imagery, may be found in poetry, music, drama. Observe, for example, how John's portrayal of the New Jerusalem inspired this beautiful analogy in Longfellow's \"Courtship of Miles Standish\": Slowly as out of the heavens with apocalyptical splendors, Sank the City of God in the vision of John the Apostle, So, with its cloudy walls of chrysolite, jasper and sapphire, Sank the broad red sun and over its turrets uplifted, Glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city. ?(See Revelations 211 In its universal sweep, its emotional depth and height, the Rhapsody of the Millenium is majestic literature. More than this, it is saving scripture. Lifting lines, such as, \"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life,\" offer sustaining strength and comfort for the faithful. They hold hope for those who, despite unearned suffering and testing tragedy, keep their trust in God and their feet in the path of righteousness. Suggestions for Discussion and Activities 1. What, in brief, is the central theme of the Revelation of John the Divine? 2. Sketch the main parts in the development of the sacred theme. Give here just a brief line suggesting each; as, (a) Prologue: Message of Christ to the Seven Churches; (b) The Sealed Book of the Lamb. 3. Be prepared to read aloud one of these scenes from Revelation: (a) \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" (chap. 6:1-7); \"Adoration of the Saints\" (chap. 7:9-15); \"Seventh Angel Sounds his Trumpet\" (chap. 11:15-19); \"Michael and the Dragon\" (chap. 12:7-12); \"Announcement of the Everlasting Gospel\" (chap. 14:6-7); \"Fall of Babylon\" (chap. 18); \"Praise of the Saints for God\" (chap. 19:5-10); \"The New Jerusalem\" (chap. 21:1-8). 4. Procure the song \"The Holy City\" and read its lines; or better, have it sung. What inspired this song? 5. Be ready to give from Revelation some other musical lines that are woven into one of our hymns; or some other quotation from the Book that has brought uplift to you. Note: Use King James' translation as the basic text for this study of Revelation. Social Science Modern Applications of Ethical Principles Lesson 7?Brotherhood, the Key to Greatness Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, May 22, 1945 Lesson Link. Character, through honest living, was the substance of our discussion one month ago. It was shown that the assimilation of facts alone does not produce virtue. Parents and others too frequently neglect responsibility in the moral training of youth, and people, generally, are* too prone to deceive by substituting reputation for character. Honesty is the core of character, and it is Unfortunate that so many disintegrate at the core while they struggle desperately to maintain a gloss on the surface. Lesson aim. To show that greatness is dependent upon bigness of soul; that virtue in its highest sense requires the submergence of self to the welfare of others. IT has been said earlier that happiness is contingent upon love and service as well as upon personal health and progression. The application of truth to ourselves, and the devotion of ourselves to truth, are both prerequisite to real joy and the good life. But if we stop with ourselves alone, we stop far short of the goal, for man is a social being and, try as he may, man cannot become happy or great all by himself. As someone has said, \"Joy is a partnership, grief weeps alone.\" Happiness and selfishness are simply incompatible terms.\nMan has come a long way in his quest for knowledge and power applied to personal aggrandizement. It is time now that he learn how to love, give, and help for the benefit of others.\nThe Social Sense\nLove of neighbor is second only in importance on the scale of moral values to love of God and the principles of truth and righteousness he exemplified (See Matthew 22: 35-40). Not only is it impossible for man to be saved in ignorance, but it is impossible for him to be saved alone and in hate, as well. A sense of interest and responsibility in humanity about us, coupled with a willingness to consider ourselves secondary to the general welfare of all mankind, is essential to the highest good.\nJesus recognized this moral principle when he said, \"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it\" (Mark 8:34-35). When one selfishly or hatefully strives for self-benefit at the expense of others, he loses out on the better things of life, on satisfactions that can come only from self-denial, love, and service.\nBut this sense of social justice for world welfare is frequently never realized in the thinking and living of people. Covetousness, too, often crowds out generosity; vanity and egotism push aside humility and meekness; sympathy gives way to suspicion and slander; and love is outdone by hate. In their wild scramble for happiness, people too often center on themselves alone, and in so doing they lose the very thing that they seek.\nSmallness of character is a vice that feeds upon egotism and self-interest. Some people are small because they take themselves too seriously, they lack a sense of humor, they see themselves in distorted and inflated perspective. Others are small because they are unfriendly, inhospitable, inconsiderate; more concerned with personal advantage than with equality or justice, and straws willing to lie, steal, cheat, or hoard at the expense of the public. Still others are small because of the prejudices and hates they allow to operate. LESSON DEPARTMENT 125  Small people are parasites and leeches draining the life blood of humanity. Instead of contributing to society they take from it; instead of building it up they drag it down. Petty jealousy, malicious gossip, and trivial bickerings are characteristic of people like this? and the world is too full of their kind. Greatness is a quality of character derived from a sense of brotherhood, and its marks are those of sacrifice, charity, gratitude, loyalty, and the like. Gratitude in Place 01 Greed There is nothing that betrays the true character of a person any more than acts of ingratitude. Sometimes these acts grow out of selfish interests and the spirit of greed, and sometimes out of hate and the desire for revenge; but always in the unthankful heart there is an absence of love and social responsibility. The attitude of gratitude is one of the first steps in achieving greatness of soul. But we are at times prone to hide our feelings of friendliness and appreciation even when we have them, and that is bad. Why keep our hearts in cold storage? Expressions of gratitude and kindly acts toward those around us in appreciation for all they mean to us are small pay for the innumerable and continuous favors each receives from others. Furthermore, through such cheerfulness and helpfulness the soul of the giver is lifted up along with the souls of receivers, and in this way the world is made better and happier. We should speak a heartfelt thanks, write a letter of appreciation, perform an act of gratitude, whenever and wherever the opportunity permits. Every day should be a thanksgiving day. But gratitude to be helpful must be genuine. There is an unfortunate tendency in this modern day to standardize and commercialize sentimental expressions to the extent that they become artificial, superficial, and hollow. Too often we say things that others have composed, buy gifts that others have made, and give gifts out of habit or because we feel that we are expected to. Money interests through advertising have capitalized upon the sentiments of man until now Christmas, Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, birthdays, anniversaries, and other holidays have become festive occasions with great displays of gifts, but too little genuine appreciation springing from the soul. This is a perversion of sentiment and there is need for a return to the original, undiluted, and unpolluted. Gratitude is a virtue, but it requires neither the spending of money nor elaborate demonstration, and it is best when it is spontaneous, natural, and sincere. Tolerance Without Indifference Brotherhood implies the willingness and the ability to co-operate with others even when it is distasteful to do so. We don't need to tolerate wrong and evil, but we can be kindly and helpful to those who are in sin; we don't need to let go our convictions, but we can examine them in light of all the evidence, and we can suspend judgment until all the facts are known. Intolerance grows out of ignorance, falsehood, and prejudice; and it is unethical, unchristian, and un-American. But tolerance, of course, means neither indifference nor acceptance. Without conviction, tolerance may lead to instability and the perpetuation of wrong. On the other hand, though, conviction without tolerance may mean narrow dogmatism and blind bigotry. What we really need is a combination of the two; tolerance should be strengthened with conviction, and conviction should be open-minded and accompanied by mercy and charity for all. Unity does not require uniformity; we can have diversity and still work together co-operatively for the welfare of all humanity. If we can't agree, then we can agree good-naturedly to disagree, and go on living together in the spirit of tolerant participation. It is better that judgment be left to a power higher than mortal man. Failure to do this means intolerance, which often results in fundamental and far reaching injustice. Gossip is unkind; hate is vicious. It is our place to forgive; only God's place to judge. Tolerance is one of the most important and, yet, most lacking virtues in the scale of moral values. Benevolence Beyond Justice While brotherhood is based upon the concepts of equality and justice, it goes far beyond the bare requirements of these principles. It is born of the spirit of love, and leads to unselfishness, altruism, and generosity. It is not enough to be tolerant in a negative sense, we should be actively doing good in a positive sense; it is not enough to \"live and let live,\" we should live and help live. If man is -really impregnated with the spirit of brotherhood, his benevolence will reach far beyond retribution and justice alone; love and mercy will cause him to be generous beyond all specifications of law?and in this he will be really great. Nobility Through Sacrifice But the test of true greatness lies in one's willingness to deprive himself that others may benefit. Being tolerant of those around us, showing gratitude for their friendship and help, and even rendering service beyond bare requirements of justice, are all relatively easy where there is no particular sacrifice or inconvenience involved. It is through self-denial and sacrifice, however, that the greatest love is demonstrated and the greatest good accomplished. Nobility of character is a thing to be achieved through love, service, and sacrifice. The life of Christ furnishes an excellent example of nobility through sacrifice. He died that others might live, and in so doing he proved his greatness. Coming out of World War II, as has been true of all wars, are accounts of personal bravery and self-sacrifice beyond the call of duty. One of these accounts relates the experiences of a group of soldiers who had willingly and without complaint become \"expendable\" in the interests of their country.? Such unselfish heroism (and this is but one of a great many examples that could be cited) should make the hearts of everyone, regardless of country or creed, feel proud, for it demonstrates how noble and great man is capable of becoming. (See William L. White, They Were Expendable, New York City, Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1942). LESSON DEPARTMENT 127 The world is made better by such sacrifice. But the sad thing is that man so seldom rises above the petty, selfish, and commonplace activities of life. It is an unfortunate reflection upon humanity that it takes a war to make people really noble, and that, even then it is the battle front, not the home front, where true greatness is so often found. Why is there so much narrowness, cheapness, and smallness in the world today! Why are so many ignoble! Why are so few really great! Because selfishness, distrust, and hate are let loose, and world brotherhood remains largely an ideal not yet reached. If men are to be really great they must be willing to make themselves \"expendable,\" just as did Christ, and just as have many others in times of crisis. Consecration to an ideal; allegiance to a principle; loyalty to the right and to those who stand for the right; and, what is more, a willingness to sacrifice all, even life itself if necessary, for decency and justice?these things are important if man is to climb and if Christianity and civilization are to survive. Men should be more humble, teachable, and charitable; they should be less willing to misrepresent facts and exploit persons, and more willing to appreciate and accommodate others; they should have more brotherly love and be more noble in expressing it. When we sing \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men\" (Luke 2:14), let us remember that the glory of God is best realized through peace, and that peace can only come by the development of \"good will toward men.\" Brotherhood is a prerequisite to the greatest good in the universe and is therefore the key to greatness in personality. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Why are happiness and selfishness incompatible terms? Illustrate with examples. Why is it impossible for man to find either salvation or happiness all by himself? What did Jesus mean when he said that those who would try to save their lives would lose them, and vice versa? How does this apply to brotherhood? What do we mean by the \"social sense\"? Show how it is defeated by egotism; by selfishness; by prejudice and hate; by jealousy; by gossip; by petty bickering. Discuss each of these in turn, pointing out relationships to brotherhood and morality. What is a social parasite? 2. Why is ingratitude wrong? Is it necessary to speak words of appreciation when your actions already demonstrate that you are thankful? Which is the best expression of gratitude, words or actions? Show how gratitude expression is sometimes perverted. What do we mean by the commercialization of sentiment? Discuss. How can the expression of feelings on holidays and at other times be made more genuine and meaningful? Discuss. 3. Define tolerance. Does it require indifference on an issue or acceptance of another point of view? Give reasons for your answer. Define prejudice. What are the major reasons for the existence of prejudices and intolerance? Why. Should we suspend judgment of others and be anxious to forgive them of their mistakes. Does this condone sin? Is there a danger in being too forgiving? Discuss. 4. What is \"benevolence beyond justice\"? Why is the philosophy of \"live and help live\" of a higher order than \"live and let live\"? 5. What is nobility of character, and how is it achieved? Illustrate with the life and the teachings of Christ. What does it mean to be expendable? Was Christ expendable? Why is this a quality of greatness? Explain why there is so much cheapness and smallness in the world today. What is the result in society at large? In the character of people? Why is brotherhood the key to greatness? Selected References Milton Bennion, Moral Teachings of the New Testament, Deseret Book Co., 1928, pp. 36-38; 57-66; 95-118; 153-162. (Out of print) William L.

Work Meeting COMBINATION APRON AND SEWING BAG ANY woman who sews, darns, mends, or does fine needlework, crocheting or knitting will appreciate an apron with pockets to hold her thimble, scissors, and tape measure, and keep her sewing clean, too. This combination apron and utility bag* is very convenient and practical. Materials required?1 1/6 yds. Fabric, preferably heavy, washable print or solid color, \"Yi yards cord or ribbon for draw string and to tie envelope accessory holder, bias binding, two wooden rings, beads or buttons. To make?Cut two pieces of material 16 3/4 inches by 22 inches for bag (A) (Illus. 1). Seam the bottom and sides. Turn down 1 3/4 inches at top for hem. Stitch hem, then stitch 3/4 inch from edge of hem to make a Ya inch casing to enclose draw string. Leave seam on outside of casing open for draw string. Cut one piece 10 1/2 inches long by 22 1/2 inches wide for apron part (B) (Illus. 2). Make 1/4 inch hem on each side. Sew lower edge to inside of back of bag, stitching Y inch below (C) hem stitching. Make a second stitching over hem stitching (E) and through apron to hold apron in place and to cover raw seam. Make pocket (D) 4 1/2 inches by 13 1/2 inches finished with 3/4 inch hem at top. Stitch to back of bag and over lower edge of apron, allowing top of pocket to come to stitching (E). A small, envelope-style folder may be made (Illus. 4), the pocket to hold small scissors, skeins of floss, buttons, thimble, etc., the strip of outing flannel to hold needle and pins. When the apron is pinned and C and tied with ribbon or cord attached at point H, a very compact sewing equipment case results (Illus. 5). This may be kept in small pocket in apron. Band for top of apron and tie strings may be cut from remaining material. When one stops sewing, the apron top may be folded down into the bag, the draw strings pulled, and presto, one has a utility bag to hang on one's arm to take places, or to hang by the draw string in a convenient place ready for future use. Further suggestions on aprons will appear in the March issue of the Magazine. *This apron design was originated by Ruth T.

            "content": "How to Choose a Painting Alice Merrill Horne Former Member Relief Society General Board HOW should one go about choosing a painting? When one considers that a good work of art is purchased not for one person, not even for one generation, but for posterity, then one realizes that the most careful study is needful in choosing a painting.\nArt is universal. No one country can claim all the gifts. Each individual is endowed with a degree of talent though not every soul is permitted to realize himself. The human soul is the finest instrument and can hardly fail to discern beauty. Even a little child will select the best picture in a collection. The best poem, the greatest symphony, the most profound work of art is declared as such, is set apart as such, by universal taste. Art critics have no part in the selection of masterpieces for the reason that each generation evaluates its own productions thus, we learn to put faith in the masses.\nEach nation has pride in its own gifts and seeks to save its best productions, and that is why we visit other countries. In witnessing their handiwork, their precious, treasured paintings and sculptures, we can learn the causes of greatness and can estimate the scale of a nation's attainments and culture. In this way, admiration for the best is developed, establishing friendly relations between nations.\nThe world's cultural loss because of the present satanic world conflict is of colossal proportions. The heartbreaking truth is that it may take\ngeneration to reveal the full cultural loss that has been sustained by the invaded countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The gentle, peaceful countries, now subjected to force, have seen their treasures of arts and crafts, and fabrics of handlooms torn from them. They were ruthlessly pillaged for the low purpose of degrading, impoverishing, and conquering them. Knowing well the value of art, the aggressor nations have thus schemed to lift their own financial and cultural life by seizing art productions from those gentle people who created them.\nThe world has learned to recognize the need for works of art. Let us consider how a picture is selected for its rightful place in the field of art:\n(1) A picture should be a design. Women of this day are truly designminded. It will be easy to get right into the spirit of design. Shall we sit down and design a rug? I have long pictured Relief Society members designing rugs as do the artminded, rug-weaving Orientals.\n(2) Every woman desires a tiled bathroom floor, so let us design such a floor.\n(3) Make a design for a counterpane using the motif grapes, grape leaves, or a petunia. Oak leaf and acorn pattern could be used.\n(4) Do you make real lace? Then you would find a delightful exercise in creating a rose design for a real lace collar.\n(5) Make a sego lily design for a bedroom pillow. Page  (6) Using the mountain maidenhair fern and a wild rose, create a design for a tablecloth. (7) By this time you will be prepared to design a picture. Design your Picture Go out with your sketching pad and colored crayons, and put in a blue sky with a white cloud. Place a hill with white snow patches that will repeat the white cloud. Draw in a farmhouse. Now add a group of Cottonwood trees which will seem to love and protect the house. Make a path that leads to the front steps. The trees will have some leaf buds opening, to repeat the greens on the lawn and garden in front of the house. R Now organize what you have sketched into a diamond in a square. Millet liked to compose his pictures that way. Values in a Picture Look at your picture and answer these important questions: 1. Is the sky a dome or is it flat like a vertical wall? 2. Does the foreground come forward to meet you? 3. Does the background stay back? 4. Does the farmhouse stay in front of the trees? 5. Do the trees stay in front of the hill? 6. Is the sky behind the hill? 7. Do you feel there is another side to the hill? 8. Does the path come to you? If you answer \"yes\" to these questions, you have what artists name \"good values.\" The \"values\" of a painting is important for you want to feel spatial relations. It would feel awkward to make a house you could not walk around. A Dominating Theme In your picture there should be a dominating subject. You might use a dozen other subjects, but each and all of these should be subservient to the main point of interest. So, please, do not choose a painting which is divided in interest, in other words, constitutes two pictures instead of one. Therefore, always search for the dominating theme and discover if all of the minor details are needed to strengthen the dominating theme. An exercise in Painting greens An artist once asked me to give him a criticism on his exhibition. Three paintings hung side by side: The first, Yellowstone Park; the second. Southern Utah; the third. Salt Lake Valley looking toward the Wasatch Mountains. \"I fear you will not like my criticism.\" \"Please tell me what you see in my work.\" Nothing could keep me from giving an honest criticism where it was so much needed. \"You are lazy. You are not observing. The way you paint green accuses you. Green is what the light makes it. Your greens seem to have all been mixed in one pot. Notice that the greens at the top, as well as at the bottom in your Yellowstone Mountain, are exactly like the patches of green at the top and bottom of the Wasatch Mountains. Now compare the greens on your Dixie Mountain. There is no variation. If you will study the greens in any landscape, such as you have painted here, I am sure you will find light greens, dark greens, warm greens, and cool greens. Do you need glasses or is it laziness working on you, that you do not see that the greens at top, bottom, and middle distance are very different?\" When I saw his work a year later, it had changed markedly, and how he was enjoying the greens.\nHorticulture versus Variety\nDo you like pictures of trees? It is a favorite subject of mine, especially the way the spaces between the trees are painted is of vital interest. A row of trees exactly alike with spaces between equally uninteresting would satisfy a horticulturist, but so much monotony would slay an art critic. No two spaces should be alike. In your favorite picture of trees you may find several little pictures in between like trunks and boughs of trees.\nInasmuch as you are buying a picture for yourself and posterity, remember always that the best picture is worth two of the second best, three of the third best, and I do not recommend the fourth best for posterity.\nEurope has many collections that have been brought together for\nposterity. It is ever true that nations are known and remembered by what was accomplished in art before that nation was cleft in twain by designing men of that or some other land.\nAfter all, there are only two kinds of art, good and bad and, oh yes, there is the middling good which, like the middling good egg, can't be used. The better a work of art is, the more people recognize its superiority. So-called art critics praise gawky productions, such as nudes painted from wooden mannekins with the human figure distorted, but just so long as the great common class does not admire such work, it will be recognized as bad art.\nBest Pictures Survive\nPictures that lift the taste of the people are of great and lasting worth. But, after all, something is of still greater importance; namely, the artists who paint the good pictures. Without the artists, there can be no progress in art, but if the artists are loved by the people, supported by the people, why might we not have a renaissance of our own? But whatever happens, we must continue to buy good pictures for the sake of posterity.\nAN INESTIMABLE JEWEL\nIt is not merely for today but for all time to come that we should perpetuate for our children's children that great and free government which we have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you to remember this, not merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen, temporarily, to occupy the White House. I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has. It is in order that each one of you may have, through this free government which we have enjoyed, an open field and a fair chance to develop your own genius and intelligence that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life, with all its desirable human aspirations. It is for this the struggle should be maintained that we may not lose our birthright not only for one lifetime but for two or three years. The matter of the world is worth fighting to maintain for this inestimable jewel. A. Lincoln"

            "content": "Your Part in Utah's Centennial Prepared by the Utah Centennial Commission David O. McKay, Chairman; A. Hamer Reiser, Secretary *\"at the request of the Church Beautification Committee. \nDESPITE war-imposed handicaps, Utah will celebrate her Centennial in 1947 appropriately and well, because her citizens descendants of pioneers possess to a degree, at least, the sterling characters of the pioneers themselves.\nTo celebrate the Centennial fittingly under the pressure of war and its aftermath, will require idealism, vision, fortitude, and an abundance of hard work.\nTime is running against us, and, as it runs away in wartime, it takes with it opportunities to obtain materials and labor for the extensive program of construction contemplated in the original plan of the Centennial Commission. Adaptations and simplification of that plan may therefore be imperative.\nFeatures of the Commission's original plan, in which materials are a minor part, can, nevertheless, be developed in wartime. These include many of the cultural and spiritual aspects of the celebration. History, music, and the other arts, and the modern facilities for their expression, can be utilized for the presentation of the essential message of the Centennial. These can be effectively employed locally in community projects large and small. Schools, churches, clubs in all parts of the State can be busy hives of productive activity in furtherance of the fundamental Centennial theme.\nTo a substantial degree certain of the most important physical aspects\nof the Centennial can be developed, war or no war.\nIn the course of doing our daily tasks, even in wartime, every one of us can, by spending an extra hour today and another tomorrow, work at transformation in a year's time in the appearance of his home, farm, shop or factory. If each of us can have the help and co-operation of family, neighbors, and associates in business, church or club activities, and, in his turn, will give a full measure of help and co-operation with an eye to the beautification of his surroundings, the State of Utah can be adorned with attractive villages, towns, and cities well before the close of the Centennial year.\nWar-imposed restrictions may aid rather than hinder us in this achievement. Deprived of means and opportunity to travel, we can spend our time, energy and money at home and have, as the outcome, the satisfaction and pride of having our own products and arrangements, neatness, and beauty in our immediate surroundings.\nWho has not enjoyed a merited sense of satisfaction and pride upon seeing, as the result of his handiwork, a neatly kept lawn; a well-cultivated and arranged garden; beautiful shrubs, stately, healthy trees; a well-laid-out farm, efficiently managed; an orderly and attractive home, shop or factory! Whoever has not had this experience has been denied one of the most gratifying of emo-\nPage 70 YOUR PART IN UTAH'S CENTENNIAL 71 There is beauty and inspiration in every manifestation of care and pride in the use and preservation of machinery, tools, equipment, furniture, buildings, fences, houses, barns, and shops. It takes the soul of an artist and a poet to keep alive the appreciation of orderliness and craftsmanship which was so plentiful in Utah pioneer communities. One needs only to take the time to examine the buildings erected by early settlers of this State to discover a high standard of care and craftsmanship in the construction and adornment of their buildings. These are the evidences of culture, artistic sense, self-respect, and character in craftsmanship which we today must emulate, and by doing so honor ourselves as being worthy of our pioneer ancestry. Our Centennial Celebration will be empty and unworthy, if we do not exhibit unmistakable evidence of civic pride and of the sturdy virtues of industry and good husbandry, orderliness, neatness and love of beautification, which are such eloquent expression of the idealism of the pioneers. They dreamed dreams of beauty for their mountain homeland, and they worked hard to make those dreams real in productive fields and blossoming landscape. NATURE has made Utah beautiful with unmatchable color and variety. We who love her wall aid her, and will never let it be truthfully said of us that \"man is the great de-facer.\" If we sincerely admire her and love her for her beauty, we delight in paying our homage to her by doing everything we can to enhance her beauty, and nothing to mar it. Utah, the Star of the West, gains her physical beauty and color from nature, and her brilliance and luster from the sterling character of her citizens, who express their virtues in the attractiveness of their persons, personalities, and property. The Centennial Celebration of 1947, war or no war, will call the people of the State upon the stage, in the center of the spotlight, to exhibit the fruits of their pioneer heritage. Shall we earn the applause of the audience, as being worthy of the admiration which our famous ancestors have won? A good, practical example of collective community action toward beautification is offered in the situation in certain Salt Lake City areas where fast-growing, short-lived trees were planted in the early days to provide quick shade. These have now spent themselves and are dead. Equipped with available city-owned machinery, responsible groups of individuals, civic clubs, priesthood groups or quorums, by working to a well-planned schedule and assignments, could remove the trees in a short time, cut up and save the wood against times of local need and, at the same time, improve the general appearance of the community, remove hazards to life and property and make ready for planting of new trees according to the city's plan. A similar project in many Utah communities can be the starting point for wartime community beautification. Every community, through the action of individuals and organized groups, can participate in annual or more frequent \"clean-up and paint-up\" campaigns, and can thus put in (Continued on page 128) Second Prize Story Annual Relief Society Short Story contest"

            "content": "The Bureau Vesta Pierce Crawford VESTA PIERCE CRAWFORD YOU remember your Grandma Watts, don't you? Bertha Carlson, she was, before she married me. You remember when she died, but that was a long time ago and you were living in California. I suppose Bertha was very much like other women, only better. But when we were young I thought there was one particular thing about her that was peculiar. She set her heart on a piece of furniture. Page 72 I remember the first time Bertha mentioned wanting a bureau. We called them bureaus then, although I hear your wife referring to them as chests of drawers. We needed bureaus badly because the houses had no built-in cabinets. We had just moved into our first home one room. There sat Bertha on the floor with a heap of bundles around her, all her wedding finery. She held some lacey things in her pretty hands and she looked at me with coaxing blue eyes.  John,  she said,  I do wish I had a bureau.  I bent down and put my arms around her and kissed her auburn hair, and I said, \"Don't you worry, Bertha. I'm the one that's going to get you a bureau and everything else you want.\" I didn't know then what I've learned since or I wouldn't have made promises. I never would have made promises. It takes a long time to learn things, and sometimes you don't learn until it is too late. Bertha must have thought of that bureau a lot after she first mentioned it. Just before our first baby came she asked about it again. She had all the clothes about done, stacks of them, but where she got the cloth from I don't know, for I wasn't making much. Dry farming, you know depends on the weather. You don't have a regular income. So, as I said before, I don't know where Bertha got the cloth for the baby clothes. Maybe her folks gave her some or she might have cut up some of her wedding things.\nI can't forget that evening. It was November and the wind rattled the door. Bertha was sitting by the kitchen range with her crochet hook flying, and there, piled on the table were the baby things. She said she felt pretty good and she laid down the crocheting and started to fix my supper. She began to move the things off the table. Then she stopped and said, \"John, dear, I do wish I had a bureau. It would be nice if I had some drawers to put these things in.\"\nI put my arm on her shoulder and I asked, \"How much do they cost?\"\n\"Maybe fifteen dollars,\" she said, \"or twenty-five for a big solid-oak one.\"\nBut I didn't have a five in my pocket.\nThe next day I went to the store and got a big empty dry-goods box, and together we lined it with cloth and put the baby clothes in it, and Bertha seemed contented.\nQueer about women, though. She had her heart set on the bureau. Never asked for much else, and I made up my mind I'd get the bureau for her as soon as ever I could. That wasn't easy to do, for we always needed something else worse a new cook stove, a carpet, some tools or machinery. Then we had to build on to the house and make it larger, as you see it now, with this fancy porch and the bedrooms and all. We had five children and we needed the extra rooms.\nWhen I saw Bertha getting old and frail looking, I was worried. She never mentioned the bureau any more. I did manage to buy some furniture, a sofa, and a leather chair, and a desk for the parlor. We got along and we tried to be kind to each other. But even when I was alone, her voice seemed to be ringing in my ears. This was strange, for Bertha was a quiet woman by nature and she was never one to nag about anything. Once when I was sitting at sundown on a ledge above the river a light wind was blowing. Then, all at once, I thought I could see Bertha coming up the cliff, and I thought I heard her say, \"John, I do need a bureau.\"\nI was terribly ashamed of myself and I made up my mind to get the bureau at once. Our youngest daughter, Emily, was going to get married. Her mother kept sewing and sewing, and there were patterns and goods and thread scattered all about and stacks of new things around. One afternoon I came in early from the field, and there sat Bertha at the sewing machine, treadling fast. She stopped suddenly and looked up at me. In a minute tears were streaming down her face. She turned away and treadled again. Emily went over and touched Bertha's gray hair and asked, \"What's the matter, Mother?\"\nI knew what it was. She wanted that bureau so that Emily's wedding things could be put away and kept in good shape until she was ready for them.\nThis time I was surely going to get the bureau. I told Emily my plans. I was going to surprise her mother by bringing home a bureau. On the way to town I met Bart Sanders. He asked me if I wanted to buy his mowing machine. He was moving away and the machine was a good buy. I needed it the worst kind for my own mower was broken down, and was always at the blacksmith shop just when I needed it most. A good machine would be an investment. I told Bart I would take it and pay cash down. I hated to do it, but I thought that sometime later I could buy a better bureau for Bertha and she would be that much more pleased. She could afford to wait a while longer since she wasn't expecting the bureau anyway. I went home with the mowing machine and showed it to Bertha and Emily, but I didn't say anything about having intended to spend the money in another way. SIX months later our Emily got married. Bertha and I were alone in the house. Alone. I tell you I never heard so much silence. Then one night after supper when I was sitting at one side of the table and Bertha across from me, she said quietly,  You didn't get it, did you?\" I shifted around in the chair. \"Get what. Bertha?\" Her voice was level. The bureau. Emily told me you were going to get a bureau to keep her wedding things in. I believed you really would. But it doesn't matter any more. Now the children have come and gone there isn't anything left to use a bureau for.\" Her face was gray and she didn't say anything more. After a while she went into the bedroom and closed the door quietly. I don't remember how long I sat at the table. She wouldn't need a bureau now, she had said, but a woman can always use a bureau. Five years after Emily was married the lucern seed crop was good. I had some extra money in my pocket. I hitched up and drove the wagon fifteen miles over to Mayfield and tied up at the Emporium. They had lots of bureaus, big high solid-oak ones, and wider ones made of white maple, and polished walnut bureaus with six drawers. Then all at once I saw the one 1 wanted. It was a beauty. Painted green, and over that, for trimming, big pink roses. It had golden looking handles and carved legs with shining casters. I bought it. Fifty dollars, but it was worth twice that. I loaded it on the wagon, covered it with an old quilt, and drove home. I remember, yet, how anxious I was to get there. Bertha had gone out somewhere. I set the bureau by the bed in our room and then I went into the kitchen to wait. What would she say? What would she think of the green paint and the pink roses? It was fall, and when Bertha came in she was wearing her coat, a gray coat buttoned up tight. \"Well, John,\" she said, \"when did you get home?\" \"Just now.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"Nowhere.\" She took off her coat and started for the bedroom. I held my breath. She stood in the doorway. She kept standing there.   \"Bertha,\" I said, \"don't you like it?\" Finally she turned around. Her face was as gray as ashes and she was THE BUREAU 75 \" trembling. She tried to smile and I had a queer idea that she was trying to make the years drop off I had queer idea that she was trying to make the years drop off her. She walked toward me slowly and put her hand on my shoulder.  John,  she said,  You got the burequ after all.  But she didn t put a thing in the drawers. Time after time I looked, but there was never the least trinket put in the bureau. One day I asked,  Bertha, don t you like the bureau?  You didn t look at me  Sure,  she said,  I like it fine. It s the handsomest bureau I ever saw.  But I wasn t satisfied and I wasn t pleased with myself. I went to the window and watched the rain beating down and there was no comfort in it. The room was too quiet. I knew it would always quiet."

She lived in Edinburgh, Scotland, until 1863, when she heard the gospel preached by the Mormon missionaries and became convinced of its truthfulness, and was baptized.\nAs did most people during the early days of the Church, she desired to come to Zion, so she sold her business and all her household belongings, said goodbye to her kindred and friends, and started out with her two children for a new world and a new life.\nThey crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the good ship Underwriter, leaving Scotland the middle of March and arriving in New York on May 22, 1861. These saints, with others, were presided over by Charles W. Penrose, Milo Andrus, and Homer Duncan. The six weeks' voyage was very rough; many were ill, and one man died and was buried at sea. A weary trek across the plains followed their arrival in America. Imagine the heartache of grandmother with no companion to help her share her responsibilities! She had supreme faith, however, that she would reach her destination and be able to make a home for herself and children in Zion. She was a woman of very thrifty. She had a natural talent for nursing, and she always seemed to know what to do in an emergency and there were many emergencies on the plains. Fortune seems to smile upon those women who roll up their sleeves and put their shoulders to the wheel; upon women who are not afraid of dreary, dirty, irksome drudgery, who do not turn aside for obstacles, whether great or small. \"He alone is great who by a life heroic conquers fate.\"\nGrandmother and her two children did arrive safely in Salt Lake, and after a time she was married to Robert Hogg. Her joy at being in Salt Lake with the saints was shortlived, however. Brigham Young was calling men to go north, east, south, and west to start new communities. Grandmother, her husband, and children were sent to the little valley of Morgan where they settled in the town which is now known as Milton, about five miles from Morgan City. Here they built the first house in that locality. The first winter they had only one sack of flour and a very few necessities, and the winter was very severe.\nJessie (my mother) was now nine years of age. There were no schools of any kind in Morgan County and very few books. Mother learned to read and spell from the songbooks in Church. She was a beautiful singer, and she loved to memorize hymns as well as to sing them. In Page 76 THE BIG HORN BASIN 77 A. O. WOODRUFF AND JESSE W.

            "content": "literature. Mother was married in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City to George H. Taggart when she was only sixteen years of age. The ceremony was performed by President Joseph F. Smith. Father had been sent with his father to Morgan to build a flour mill which was the first one in that part of the State. Mother's first child was born when she was seventeen years of age, and from then on her children came about every two years. The family was very poor, and she was tried in many, many ways; but she was naturally of a cheerful, determined disposition, with a good sense of humor, and she made the best of every situation. There were no doctors in the community, so grandmother decided to be an obstetrician. She was the only one in Morgan for many years, and she did most of her work without monetary compensation. She must have been a good midwife, for she cared for my mother through sixteen, completely successful confinements. There was no chloroform in those days and child bearing was not the relatively easy matter it is today. I can see grandmother now with a little black lace bonnet on her head, a shoulder shawl, and a satchel, about which we were very curious as children. She would come every day for ten days, then, with the help of the older children, mother would again assume her responsibilities. As Christmas time approaches, my thoughts always revert to my childhood. Our Christmas presents were few and simple. Among the presents I shall always remember were the silver rings father made for us out of silver coins. Dimes were used in making those for the smaller children, and quarters were used for the larger ones. He made our doll cradles, beds, sheet-iron stoves, with an oven and stovepipe, for mud pies. Mother always knitted new stockings for us; I was quite a young lady when I had my first \"store stocking.\"\nAs the family increased in number and the boys grew older (there were ten of them), father began to wonder what to do with us all. Being a tradesman, he had no land excepting the acre on which our home was built. For young people to leave home in those days to find work in the cities was considered a dangerous thing. About this time, the year 1900, Governor DeForest Richards, and Secretary of State Fentemore Chatterton visited President Lorenzo Snow and counselors asking for a colony of Mormons to be sent to the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming. President Snow appointed Owen Woodruff, of the Council of the Twelve, to take charge of the project, as he had been out to Burlington, Wyoming, and had organized a ward there. He had been shown the Greybull Valley and had seen the crops produced there, samples of which he had brought back to Salt Lake. He found that a permit had been issued August 10, 1896, to the Cincinnati Canal Company to build a canal that would irrigate a large tract of land on the north side of the Shoshone River. This company had sent the Honorable Frank Mondell, who at that time was United States senator from Wyoming, to make a report on the feasibility of building the canal. He had reported that it was impossible to accomplish such a project, so it had been abandoned and the permit had expired and had been advertised for bids by November 14, 1898.\nElder Woodruff filed an application for this same tract of land on January 11, 1900, before the Land Board of Wyoming. On February 2, 1900, Elder Woodruff requested the following gentlemen to meet him in Ogden, Utah, for the purpose of making a trip to the Big Horn Basin with a view to establishing a colony there: Byron Sessions of Woodruff, Rich County; H. K. North, Salt Lake County; George H. Taggart, Morgan County; John and William Simmons, Charles A. Welch, and John Croft of Morgan County; Brigham L. Tippets and William B. Graham of Bennington, Idaho; John Stephens and S. P. Sorenson of Montpelier, Idaho; Bishop N. P. Larsen and Mr. Gumsey of Thomas Fork, Bear Lake County. Most of these men had been farmers in their own communities, but none of them had had any scientific training of any kind. However, after going over the tract of land, the party decided there was a future for the country, that it was good cattle land, and that the opportunity for home building in many places was good.\nElder Woodruff made a report to the General Authorities of the Church. It was favorably received, and he was appointed to take charge of the colonization. Franklin S. Richards drew up articles of incorporation for the Big Horn Basin Colonization Company. The organization of this company was effected in Salt Lake City, April 9, 1900, but the company was organized under the laws of the State of Wyoming.\nTHE first settlers left their homes in Salt Lake City and began their journey to the Big Horn on April 13, 1900. They started in the Year, in order to avoid high water season, as many streams had to be forded, there being no bridges over most of them. THE BIG HORN BASIN 79 MORMON PATHFINDERS TO THE BIG HORN BASIN, WYOMING Front row: George H. Taggart, Byron Sessions, Abraham O. Woodruff, William B. Graham, Brigham L. Tippetts, S. P. Sorenson. Back row: Charles A. Welch, Hyrum K. North, John Stevens, William G. Simmons, John J. Simmons. The people were organized into companies similar to the way in which the early Mormon pioneers had been organized. My father was captain of one of these companies. My two brothers, John Robert and Bruce, and two sisters, Rebecca and Nettie, were in this company. (Mother and the other members of the family remained at home until later.) They traveled one whole month before they reached their destination. The same distance and practically the same route is now traveled in eighteen hours by automobile. They encountered many difficulties. There were no roads, just trails; and the weather was bad all the way. During the heavy storms the horses were without food except for the oats the men had taken with them. The men would tie quilts about the horses to keep them from freezing to death, while they, in turn, would sit around a campfire to keep themselves warm. There was considerable sickness, one little child dying of pneumonia. Father made a coffin for her from the end gates of wagons, and she was sent back to Utah for burial. The broken-hearted parents had to carry on. The group arrived in the Basin May 24, 1900. Tents were pitched as there was not a house within a radius of fifty miles. Just three days later the first ecclesiastical organization was effected with 127 persons present. PIONEER COMPANIES NUMBERS 2 AND 3 AT HAMS FORK A Sunday School, Mutual Improvement Association, and Relief Society were organized. Lucy F. Grant, sister-in-law of President Heber J. Grant and wife of Morgan Grant, was the first Relief Society president. This was a new country in very deed. The people were faced with many obstacles and trials of all kinds. There were no roads, no towns within fifty miles, no doctors within a hundred miles. Some of the people lived in tents, some in sheep wagons, and all realized it would be months and perhaps years before they would enjoy the real comforts of life. There was no mail service, and letters had to be taken to some roadside ranch many miles away, where the stagecoach would pick them up. Rattlesnakes, lizards, - spiders, et cetera, were plentiful, and everyone had to be on the alert for them at all times. There was no feed for animals, except salt sage and a little grass. There was scarcely any grain in the country. Food had to be freighted in, and everything was very expensive. On May 28, 1900, these good people knelt in prayer on the spot that was to be the head of the canal, and they asked for God's blessings upon them. Elder Woodruff officiated. Then the work on the canal began in earnest, and very hard work it was, lasting for weeks and months, with the wind constantly blowing and the dry sand flying. It was decided that each morning and evening while work was going forward on the canal a bugle would call the camp members together to sing praises to God, and to ask for his aid. Elder Woodruff, in outlining the task that was before them, admonished the people to be united, not to profane the name of Deity, to keep the Word of Wisdom, pay tithing, and keep the Sabbath Day holy. He promised the people that if they would do these things the Lord would be a kind of Zion unto them and their children. He said, \"And that you may be united, I view, as an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, call each and everyone of you upon a mission to help build up this country, and if you will do this, the Lord will bless you forever.\"\nMen who had only gone to see the country were so impressed they decided to remain. To enable a people to perform any work, whatsoever, requires that they have faith in the ultimate result. No farmer would plant unless he expected to reap; no builder would build unless he expected to complete the structure; no man or woman would act unless there existed a faith that the destination would be reached. So, likewise, the commandments of God are obeyed because there exists a faith that certain blessings will follow obedience. Through faith our ancestors accepted the gospel, and by that same faith they left their homes in the Old World and came to a new land feeling sure they would be able to make a better future for themselves and their children, no doubt without fully realizing the many trials that awaited them. This was true of the people who went to the Big Horn Basin in April 1900. They went with faith because the Church Authorities advised it and provided them with a mission. They had great hope in the future of themselves and their children. However, they did not fully realize the trials and hardships that lay ahead.\nThe great canal took four long years to build and, when completed, it was 37 miles long, 24 feet wide on the bed, 16 feet wide at the bottom. It was built at a cost of $150,000. It\nwas never bonded, and when completed there was a credit balance of $3,000.\nThe people who worked on the ditch were given stock with the understanding that their land would cost them $6 per acre. It was later discovered it would cost them $7.50 per acre or $240 for 40 acres. Work had to be discontinued for a short period after the first six months, as there was no money with which to continue. A special fast meeting was held and everyone was asked to fast all day, and to implore the Lord to send some work whereby money could be earned to see the project through. Not many days passed before work was resumed in the following manner: The chief engineer of the Burlington Railroad Company, Mr. S. P. Weeks, came to Elder Woodruff and told him he would like our people to build twenty miles of railroad. He said his company had heard that the Mormons were colonizing in the Basin, so had decided to build a line into the country. This was indeed good news, and contracts were signed for twenty miles of grading. Thus the prayers of the people were answered. While doing this work our people held devotional exercises night and morning, and no job was undertaken without calling upon the Lord for his help.\nIT was October of 1900 that mother and the rest of the family joined father and the four children who were with him. The stark had made a camp on what is known as Sage Creek. I was about halfway between the head of the canal and the end of the project. It was here that mother and the family first located. The wind blew constantly in this country and it was a very common thing to see tents tagged-el and household belongings carried away, and what was left would be filled with sand. The water in Sage Creek was very bad and had to be boiled before it could be used. Mother would take the wood ashes and put them into a large barrel which she would have the boys fill with water. The ashes would clarify the water so it was somewhat better for laundering.\nWhile we were living at Sage Creek an epidemic of smallpox broke out. There were no doctors to be had, so my mother, relying upon her own knowledge and wisdom and the help of her Heavenly Father, nursed not only seven members of her own family back to normal health, with no complications or bad after effects, but she aided others who were stricken. It was marvelous how nearly everyone survived this epidemic.\nAfter a few months, father moved us down to the banks of the Shoshone River where the water was better and where there was some shade from the broiling sun. When we would get discouraged, we were reminded of the faith of our grandparents, their trials in crossing the plains and establishing homes in desert country in the early days. Did not Grandfather Taggart leave his wife and two little children at Winter Quarters and go with the Mormon Battalion to Mexico? We were reminded of his bleeding feet, with shoes gone when he arrived in California; of grandmother having to work to support herself and children while he was away. Father would\nChurch as a boy of seventeen, making three trips across the plains without pay. Boys and men had been asked to volunteer for this work. No, there was no turning back. We had to live up to their example and carry on.\nIn the late fall of 1901 mother and the younger children moved to the Cowley Flat where the town of Cowley is now located, while father and the older children worked on the railroad. Here the families lived in tents until spring when the men folk began building their homes. That was a terrible winter. Typhoid fever paid the community a visit. Mother nursed the afflicted day and night. Her anxiety for the members of her family who were working on the railroad, especially for the girls who did the cooking for the men, was very great. I shall always know within my own heart that God was watching over us while mother was assisting others, and that because of the faith and prayers might and morning by the whole group, consisting of more than 150 men bearing the holy Priesthood of God, and because of the private supplication of each individual, we were indeed blessed by the Lord and protected from evil.\nWhen the work on the railroad was completed, the men went back to work on the canal, which was completed in 1904. Crops were then planted and home building progressed. All the houses were built of logs. Father built us a very comfortable but humble home which surely seemed like a castle to us at the time. Of course, there were no electric lights, washing machines, irons, heating pads, vacuum cleaners, etc. in these homes. The joy of such things was not known until long afterward. THE BIG HORN BASIN 83 New School LOG HOUSE WHERE FIRST SCHOOL WAS HELD IN COWLEY Coal-oil lamps were used exclusively. (Lanterns were carried at night so one would not get lost on the prairie.) Baths had to be taken in the wash tub, which was no small task for us as we had a large family and water had to be hauled from the river a distance of four miles, and it had to be used sparingly. I am reminded of Alice Morrill's poem \"The Pioneer Mother\" which is so applicable here: A limitless expanse of wilderness surrounds her cabin home. The sun glares hot and pitiless by day, by night, the weird winds moan. Deep in her heart she makes a grave; lays there her hope of luxury, And gives her life, a ransom for the generations yet to be. In summer, the children went barefoot to save their shoes for winter. Clothing was handed down from one child to another until it was worn\"*out. Sewing bees by the women were the social gatherings. At these gatherings or bees, quilts were made, rags were sewn for carpets, and burial clothing was made. There were no undertakers and when death came the women had to take complete charge. During the first few years, my father made all the caskets, and we girls used to help him line and trim them. My father made violins for the boys and guitars for the girls. They were beautifully made with wonderful tone quality. There was always music in our home as we were all blessed with musical talent a talent also possessed by father and mother. Our home was open to all, and there were many happy gatherings there. Young people are pretty much the same in any locality. They like to dance, to play ball, have concerts, shows, etc. This was true of the young people in this settlement. The meeting house, which consisted of one large room with a stage at one end and which was heated by a large stove, was used for all community recreation, such as dancing, shows, basketball, etc. It was rather difficult to get the spirit of worship in the building on Sunday where the night before a heated basketball game had been played.\nThe people of this pioneer community believed in education. The first schoolhouse consisted of two large rooms built of logs and heated by a large stove. The settlers yearned for higher education in all its phases. In a new country the people have to provide all such things for themselves; and while they may not always provide that which is most satisfying, they meet the needs to a certain extent.\nMuch trouble was encountered by the people the first time the water was turned into the great canal. The ground was terribly dry (in fact, I don't believe it had had a good soaking since the time of Noah), and much of it was so sandy that it simply could not hold the water; so repair work on the canal had to begin immediately and go on constantly. Senator Mondell stated at one time that the Sidon Canal project would never have been successful except for the rare courage of the Mormon people.\nThe first year the crops were fairly good, then alkali came upon the land. This was like a plague to the people. Nothing would grow where alkali prevailed. So a drainage system had to be worked out; large trenches were built at great expense to the people who were not prepared to meet such a problem. In time, however, the land was drained and crops were again planted.\nWhen the Government decided to open a road into the eastern part of Yellowstone Park beginning at Cody, Wyoming, our people contracted to build sixteen miles of it. When this road was completed\nthe people once more. While building this road into the Yellowstone the same procedure was followed as on the railroad work morning and evening devotional exercises were held daily, with Church services on Sunday. Some of the best meetings I have ever attended were held out under the pine trees, and many times God seemed very close to us. One whole summer was spent on the Yellowstone Road project and this road is now the east entrance to Yellowstone Park. Many tourists prefer this entrance. It is very scenic and people are curious to see Buffalo Bill's town of Cody. Buffalo Bill (William F. Cody) was a very interesting character and he was very friendly to our people. He paid them a great tribute. He had secured a permit to irrigate all the land on the north side of the Shoshone River from Eagles Nest to the Big Horn River, but he said, \"If the Mormons want to build a canal and irrigate the land lower down the River I will relinquish both land and water to them, for if they say they will do this I know they will; they are the kind of people who do what they agree to do.\" He did what he said he would do, without compensation, much to the disgust of his partner who wanted $25,000 for the transfer. When the transfer was completed Buffalo Bill said, \"Now my dream will be realized for I have wanted to live to see this country developed into a great agricultural region, and the Mormons will fulfill my dream.\"\nFather passed away in August 1924, age 76, and mother six years later, at age 77, leaving a large posterity. Mother was a Relief Society THE BIG HORN BASIN 85  Courtesy Bishop James Harston - COWLEY WARD CHAPEL AND AMUSEMENT HALL, COWLEY, WYOMING of the Cowley Ward Relief Society for eight years. (The desire of their hearts was granted in that they were privileged to live to see the members of their family grow up and establish homes of their own. All the children were married in the Church but one, which, according to the Mormon philosophy of life, is very important. Their descendants love and respect them and appreciate the wonderful influence they have exercised over them.) Father and mother were faithful members of the Church all the days of their lives. Mother's last advice to her children was for them to continue to live the gospel and be faithful and true to God. As I write of my mother, I am thinking of many more wonderful women like her who worked with her for the benefit of the Big Horn community. They were good neighbors and wonderful souls. Many of them are still torch bearers in the Big Horn Basin. THE final chapter of this great country is yet to be written. I have not pretended to write a complete history. Many of those first pioneers have become very prosperous, some became discouraged and left the country, others have comfortable homes and good farms. Some have failed, materially speaking, but have gained spiritually; others have not progressed at all. However, we find these things to be true in every locality. Wonderful highways now connect the various communities, and with the automobile it is now possible to keep in close touch with the outside world. The railroad passes through these communities assuring mail twice each day. The three towns of Lovell, Byron, and Cowley all now have good chapels, school-houses and amusement halls. The Holly Sugar Company built a large sugar factory in Lovell which has been in operation for many years. Lovell, in the year 1900, boasted four families, two of which were bachelors. The 1942 census showed it to have 3,500 souls. There is also a canning factory in Cowley where all (Continued on page 89)"

Caine and Mrs. Franklin S. Richards attended the recent Convention of the National Woman's Suffrage Association in Washington. A very pleasant ladies' tea party was given at the Devereux House on Thursday, January 29, by Mrs. Priscilla Jennings, who is a most entertaining and hospitable hostess. There were between thirty and forty ladies present, most of them widows and missionaries' wives. The supper was very handsomely served, the table being very beautifully decorated with fragrant flowers. Mr. And Mrs. Jennings as host and hostess cannot be excelled. The afternoon and evening were spent by the ladies in social conversation, and every one seemed to intensely enjoy the visit. Devereux House is a beautiful modern mansion, and with its large and elegant parlors, commodious dining apartments, and handsome and complete library, conservatory and other luxuries, possesses all the advantages of a refined and luxurious home. We heartily wish its inmates long life and health to enjoy the blessings with which they are surrounded. Sister Eliza R. Snow Smith's birthday passed off very quietly. She received those who called to congratulate her in her parlor at the Lion House. The honored lady has now reached the advanced age of 81 years. Her health is excellent, her faculties unimpaired; indeed her memory seems as bright and perfect as ever, and her mind as clear and active as it ever has been; she still continues to write and works more hours in the day than most young people.... Correspondence: Snowville, Box Elder County, Utah, Editor Exponent  As I have never read anything in your valuable columns about Snowville (which I will state for explanation is named in honor of our beloved Apostle Lorenzo Snow, and not because we have any more snow than you do in Salt Lake City), I thought I would drop you a few lines concerning our ward. We are, the most of us, striving to be Latter-day Saints. Our Relief Society is in full force, with Sister Mary Goodliffe as Prest. They look after the poor in purse and spirit, and the sick also; they have lots of wheat on hand, in fact the Bishop says they are the richest people in the ward, and if you want anything done without fail, call on the Relief Society, and it is done....

They also like the other women they meet.

They have started the Roy Publishing Company in New York, and a book which Mrs. Kister discovered and had translated into English as \"Blessed Are the Meek\" has become a best seller. This beautifully written work is based on the life of St. Francis of Assisi, who gave up all his wealth to follow the Savior's pattern. What became of the book's author, Mrs. Zofia Kossak, in the tragedy of Poland, is unknown. EUROPE'S first woman commentator, Lisa Sergio, is now a resident of the United States, and is heard over the air on a national radio network. Her comments are intelligent and her English almost entire-Iv without accent. EDITH RUSSELL, a young British missionary with distinct writing ability, has been associate editor of the British Mission magazine, the Millennia] Star, for a year, the only woman to be on its staff during its 105 years of publication. AMERICAN-born Nancy Langhorne, now Lady Astor, was the first woman in Great Britain to be elected to the House of Commons. This is her twenty-fifth year in that position. She has decided not to stand again for Parliament. Page 87 EDITORIAL \n\nVOL. 32 FEBRUARY 1945 NO. 2"

We must acknowledge the need for mankind to accept in practice, as well as in theory, the great moral principles of the ages, a desertion of which has always brought sorrow or destruction. We must realize that character building is in reality \"the most important business of life,\" and that character is built through the adoption of moral virtues such as simple honesty, truthfulness, and love.

            "content": "social science lesson declares honesty to be the \"core of character.\" He says, \"It would be impossible to conceive of character without honesty, for any structure founded upon deceit and falsehood is founded upon sand rather than rock, and must inevitably fall.\" Yet, mankind throughout the ages has deserted this fundamental virtue. Strange as it may seem, he has done this in an attempt at self-benefit. But always in the end it has rebounded to his injury. The Bible furnishes us a good example of this. A certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession. Instead of turning it all to the apostles, as was the plan, they held Page 88 back part of the price, being dishonest with both man and God. Peter severely rebuked Ananias. Upon hearing the words of Peter, Ananias fell down dead, and his wife likewise. Examples of dishonesty are all too plentiful. Every day we hear or read of dishonest behavior or we encounter it in some form or other. An item in a local paper, issued immediately following Christmas, reported that the Christmas season of 1944 closed with one of the worst shoplifting periods in history. At one drugstore losses from larcenists were estimated as high as $500 a week, and a special office had to be set up to \"reprimand\" shoplifters. Shoplifting, store managers agreed, was not confined to needy persons as several influential citizens were caught with stolen goods. One store manager declared, \"The number of adults guilty of shoplifting would put any juvenile delinquency campaign to shame.\" He estimated his losses would run into thousands of dollars for the month of December. Dishonesty takes many forms. It appears as lying, cheating, stealing, deceiving. It asserts itself in thinking and in motives. It may be expressed by word, by deed, and by implication. It may be directed against man and God, and there are many who are dishonest with self. EDITORIAL No matter what its form or against whom it is directed, dishonesty is destructive and demoralizing. It injures the one who practices it. And wrongs the one against whom it is directed. It in no way builds nor strengthens nor benefits. Honesty, or any other moral virtue for that matter, cannot be established in a day. Moral instruction to take root must be started early and it must be continuous. Morality cannot be taught merely by precept; precept must constantly be supported by example. Parents, mothers in particular, must realize their tremendous responsibility in this respect. Knowing how desperately the world is in need of a return to the absolute moral principles which have always served mankind, recognizing how urgent is the world's need for honest men and women-men and women of character?we should give full attention to the building of such men and women. If we would conscientiously begin iK)w to train our youth to be strictly honest and virtuous, if we would teach them to put principle above immediate personal gain, the next generation would have a world fit to live in. BSS. A Pioneer Story?The Big Horn Basin (Continued from page 85) kinds of vegetables are canned. Considering the obstacles the early pioneers encountered and the struggles they had in order to get along during the first few years, they did remarkably well and proved themselves to be strong souls. \"The tendency to preserve, to persist in spite of hindrances, discouragements, and impossibilities: it is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak.\" In the final analysis it does not make much difference where we live, but how we live; it is this that determines our success in life. Therefore, I would say to all people \"Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life\" (John 6:27). \"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not\" (Gal. 6:9). Historical dates included in this article are from the book by Charles A. Welch, History of the Big Horn, Deseret News Press, 1940.

            "content": "Work Meeting \nTHE question of serving lunch at noon in connection with Relief Society work meetings, is fairly general throughout the organization, and has the approval of the General Board although not instituted nor required by the Board. Various plans are in effect for providing this lunch. For example, in some wards, groups of members are assigned to supply the lunch for the entire group once a year, in others, each member brings her own lunch and is supplied with a supplementary drink or dessert by the Society; and, in other instances, the Society meets the entire expense, assigning committee members to prepare the food. The\nmatter of meeting the expense of such lunches was considered at a meeting of the General Board, November 29, 1944, when it was decided that all Relief Societies should be authorized to use funds of the Society for this purpose, leaving it optional with local Relief Societies as to whether they meet this expense entirely, or whether they supplement lunches brought by members individually, or in assigned groups.\nAlthough approving the custom of providing lunches at work meetings which extend over the lunch period, the General Board urges that such lunches be very simple.\nSuggestive Program For Sunday Evening, March 4, 1945\nIN accordance with the plan announced by the First Presidency in 1942, designating the evening meeting of Fast Sundays for use by the auxiliaries, the Relief Society was assigned the Fast Sunday evening meetings of March and November. The November meeting constitutes the annual ward Relief Society conference, but the March meeting is open for any type of program dating to Relief Society, coming as it does on the first Sunday of the month in which the Relief Society was organized.\nFast Sunday in March occurs this year, March 4, 1945. Ward Relief Society presidents may, therefore, consult their respective bishops and ask for permission to arrange for a Relief Society meeting on this evening. The General Board submits the following suggestive program for this occasion. Supplementary suggestions for the talks and copy for the dialogue \"The Unseen Basket\" have been mailed to stake and mission Relief Society presidents for distribution to local Relief Societies.

            "content": "Mother-in-Law Edith Lovell GRACE found the timetable on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Beth had put on her coat and tied a scarf around her bright hair, and Grace had almost said, \"Don't go out in the rain, Beth; you'll catch cold!\" Almost. She remembered in time that it would sound mother-in-lawish, and held her tongue. Beth went out in the rain and turned south toward the path over the slope at the end of the street. Grace picked up the book Beth had been reading and a folder fell out of it. It was a railroad timetable. Grace stared at it silently and realized what it meant. It meant Beth was going to leave her and go back to her aunt in Texas. It meant that Beth couldn't stand it here any longer. It meant that Grace had failed as a mother-in-law. She had tried so hard! She had come to love Beth deeply. Where had she failed? What had she done? Grace could remember every detail of that crisp fall day when Beth had arrived. Ae ?? \"Well, all dressed up to impress your new daughter-in-law!\" Bill Johnson teased Grace, as she hurried into the little station. Grace smiled nervously and smoothed her new gloves. \"How soon will the train be in?\" she asked. \"Any minute now,\" said Bill. \"Yep, here she comes.\" Grace looked quickly to see if her stocking seams were straight. She hoped she looked all right. How Page 92 should a mother-in-law act? Mother-in-Jaw is such an alien word! She did want Tommy's wife to like her. Tommy had written, \"... $0 I'm sending Beth to you. There's no use of you both living alone. You'll be less lonesome together, and Beth hasn't any folks at all except her aunt and uncle here in Texas. She'll be the daughter you've always wanted. Take good care of her for me, will you, Mom?\" The train wheezed to a stop. Watching the steps, Grace thought, Let's see, I musn't be bossy, or prying, or critical. Then Beth stepped off the train. She was tall. Poised. She wore a brown suit and a brown felt hat. She looked around an instant and then walked quickly to Grace. \"You're Tommy's mother,\" she said. \"Hello, my dear,\" said Grace. She put her arms around the girl and kissed her. Beth's skin was fresh and sweet; Grace felt a surge of warmth in her heart. They smiled at each other, and then, because there was so much to say, Grace couldn't think of a thing. \"The car is out this way,\" she said, feebly, and picked up one of the suitcases. Beth picked up the other and they went to the car. \"You must be hungry,\" said Grace. \"It's almost noon.\" She drove downtown to Weston's best cafe. At the cafe, Grace's shyness subsided. They ordered. MOTHER-IN-LAW 93 \"Now tell me about Tommy\" Grace said. \"He's fine/' said Beth. \"Or he was when he left. He doesn't know where he's going, of course, but I guess it'll be overseas.\" She looked steadily at Grace. \"I have expected that/' said Grace quietly. \"He's a grand guy/' Beth's voice was husky. \"We?I?\" she stopped and then tried again. \"You must be proud of him.\" \"I am/\" said Grace. She felt that she must say something to make Beth know she was welcome. \"I want you to know how glad I am you came here to stay with me\" she said. It sounded like a speech, and Grace hadn't meant it that way at all. \"Thank you? said Beth. When they were in the car again, Grace said suddenly, \"Oh, your trunk. I forgot about it. Shall we go back and pick it up? If it isn't too big, I think it would go on the luggage rack.\" ?I? there isn't any trunk,\" said Beth. \"Just my suitcases.\" \"Oh,\" said Grace. She wished she hadn't mentioned it. She didn't care whether Beth had one piece of luggage or twenty; she was only trying to be thoughtful. I'll be more careful, she vowed mentally. I won't pry. So at home she showed Beth to Tommy's room, which was to be hers, and then left her. She fussed around making a chocolate cake, fixing the roast which she had bought for the occasion. Her mind raced ahead to the days when she and Beth would not be strangers. Beth was a lovely girl?exactly the way you would want a daughter to be. Oh, they could make quilts and linens for her, against the day when Tommy would come back and they would want a home of their own. Grace was clever with a needle; she had often thought how much she would enjoy teaching a daughter to sew. She was glad Beth had no hope-chest. Judiciously, Grace decided not to mention sewing until they knew each other better. Grace set the table with her best cloth, a linen one with cutwork embroidery. She used her silver candlesticks with fat red candles in them, and the flames danced on the surface of the shining dishes. The dinner was perfect. Beth fingered the lovely linen cloth in appreciation. They talked of Tommy. Beth told of his training hours at the airbase, of the other couples who were their friends, and of their picnics and Saturday night dances. Grace listened hungrily, for Tommy had not been home for over a year. After supper, Beth insisted on washing the dishes. Wiping them, Grace blessed the bond that bound her to Beth. THEY fell into a pleasant routine. Grace would cook breakfast and they would eat together. Then Grace would go to her job at the library, while Beth did the housework. She kept the house spic and span. She always had supper ready when Grace came home; her cooking was plain, but tasty. Grace found herself wondering about Beth's childhood, and how she had been brought up. Beth never mentioned her home in Texas.. When a letter came for her, Beth said, \"From my aunt, where I lived.\" That was all. Grace scrupulously avoided all mention of Beth's former life; she didn't want to pry. Beth was neat, and quiet; she had an undefinable air of gentle breeding about her. Grace tried to be careful about pressing her clothes; she had her hair set every Saturday morning?she didn't want Beth to think she was slovenly. But there was a wall of reserve between them. They were too polite, Grace thought. Yet, being a mother-in-law, how could she be otherwise? There were nights when Grace could hear Beth move restlessly about her room, and mornings when Beth's eyes would be swollen and red from crying. Several times when Grace had heard Beth's restless footsteps, she had gotten out of bed to go to her. Then she would look down at her old-fashioned outing flannel nightgown and decide against it. Maybe Beth would think she was nosey. Besides, her nightgown looked so backcountry. And then there was the baby that was coming. Grace had guessed it almost at once. She said nothing, and waited expectantly for the time when Beth would tell her. Oh, it would be such fun to make baby things, and to take care of a baby again! But Beth said nothing, even when her condition became apparent. Grace knew that Beth should go to a doctor, but how could she suggest it? That would be interfering! Grace remembered how she and her own mother had planned for Tommy, and how close was the bond between them as they sat together and made tiny nightgowns. But Beth was remote, and Grace dared not intrude into her silence. GRACE looked again at the timetable. If Beth left now, there would never again be an opportunity for Grace to win her friendship. That precious grandbaby would be born in Texas, and Grace wouldn't see it for years. A feeling of urgency shook her. She thrust on her galoshes and coat and hat, and hurried out of the house into the rain. Walking toward the hilly path at the end of the street, Grace's thoughts cleared. Beth had walked this way alone many times. Maybe she liked to be alone. Maybe she didn't like living in the same house with her mother-in-law. Maybe she would like a little apartment. Humbly, Grace decided she would ask Beth why she didn't like it in Weston, and what could be done to make her happier. More picture shows? Some new books? Invite more young people in? An apartment? At first the path was steep, and then it veered off into a gully where aspen trees grew thick. It was there that Grace found Beth, crumpled up beside a fallen tree. Her clothes were soaked with rain, and she was crying. \"Beth,\" Grace cried sharply. \"Beth, are you hurt?\" \"N-no,\" said Beth. \"I slipped and fell. Twisted my ankle a little, but I'm all right. It's nothing.\" But sobs shook her shoulders. Her tears mingled with the rain streaking down her cheeks, and the eyes that she raised to Grace's showed a stark aloneness that clutched at Grace's heart. Relief that Beth was not hurt flooded her, and anger, too, that the girl had gone walking in the rain. \"Beth, get up! Your clothes are soaked, and you'll have pneumonia. Why, you ought to know better, in your eagerness to take such chances!\"\nAglaia, Grace heard her own voice, scolding. Hot tears blinded her. She put her arms around Beth to help her to her feet.\n\"Oh, you'll get muddy,\" Beth protested. Shocked, Grace thought, Why she thinks I care more for my clothes than I do for her!\"\nGrace's voice trembled with horror, not emotion.\n\"Muddy? Beth, I'd die if anything happened to you. I love you as much as I do Timmy. You?you're my daughter!\"\nBeth raised her head in surprise. \"Oh,\" she said brokenly. \"You do care, don't you!\"\nShe began to cry again. Grace put her arm around her and helped her limp home.\nGrace put Beth to bed in one of the big outing flannel nightgowns. She put a hot-water bottle at her feet and brought her a glass of hot milk. They both cried a while, and their tears washed away the wall between them.\nAfter a while Beth began to talk. \"I wanted to tell you about the babe, but I was afraid maybe you'd think I was?just someone for you\nto wait on.\" She drew a deep breath. \"Your clothes, and your house, and everything is so?so perfect?and I don't know how to sew, or anything.\"\nHer eyes pleaded for understanding. Grace was appalled. All those months when she had been so careful of outside appearances, she had been driving Beth farther from her. Because she had kept herself from asking questions and making suggestions, Beth had thought that she wasn't interested?that she preferred to remain a stranger! Oh, she hadn't been a mother-in-law, but she hadn't been a mother either! Grace had made a discovery. Mothers-in-law are meddlesome because they do care, not because they don't.\nBeth was talking again. \"Aunt Lydia was good to me, but she was always so busy. I helped with the housework, and she did all the sewing. Then we ran so short of money, so after high school, I worked at the laundry to help out. Then I met Tommy. It didn't seem possible for him to love me; he's so wonderful, and I'm so?ordinary.\"\n\"You suit me exactly,\" said Grace firmly.\nAfter a while Grace went out and found the timetable and put it in the kitchen fire."

            "content": "SONG FOR A KITCHEN Miranda Snow Walton There are homes without a bedroom, where davenettes suffice, There are homes where parlors play no leading part; There are homes that have no dining room, no pantry, nor a bath, But the home without a kitchen is a home without a heart. It's a sort of filling station for a boy of nine or ten; It's the family trysting place with apple pie; And the smell of hot, brown gingerbread upon a frosty night Is a memory you'll cherish 'till you die. It's the room where you'll find mother, where little folks can come To tell their troubles, and have broken hearts made whole; Oh, a house can be most anything, a mansion or a shack, But the home without a kitchen is a home Without a soul. Forward, Without Fear Dorothy Chpp Robinson CHAPTER 7 AGAIN Ann Kristin was out following the trail of the sheep. She was a long way from camp, and alone, and because of that the sack she carried was nearly full. She was glad to get away from the others. There were so many new people in camp, and so much happiness. Newcomers were hunting relatives and friends. Letters were being read and discussed. Women, the more fortunate ones, were bargaining eagerly for new foods to relieve the monotony of their diets. Patty Lou was still going around in a daze trying to be with Jake and her family at the same time. There had been a happy gathering in the Mortensen dooryard the evening before. Around the campfire, while the Turners ate, a story had been told and retold. \"How did you come? How did you know where to come? Who told you where to find me?\" \"Jake did,\" Jinny, a younger sister, had answered, \"and you-all are even prettier than he said.\" Her letter had been months reaching them. After his first unreasoning anger at the thing that had taken his daughter away, Mr. Turner had fallen to wondering. He suspected she had no intention of returning home. It had taken him some time to arrange the transfer of money to her, then he had begun to investigate. He was curious about Page 98 the power that could keep a girl like her among strangers. \"So,\" the story had ended, \"we came on to Nauvoo. Everything we own is in these three wagons. Brother Matthew Lewis baptized us the same time he did Jake.\" Patty Lou turned slowly to face Jake who sat beside her. Her eyes filled with tears of happiness. Jake, frightened by them and the solemnity, tried to grin. \"You-all ready to quit being cagey and marry me?\" \"Jake Nichols. You are blind as a badger. I've been counting on it right along.\" \"Will you-all mind?\" \"I love doing what pleases you.\" \"Make her give a definite promise,\" Mr. Turner advised, and the others smiled their agreement with him. \"I am not inferring this time,\" the girl turned serious. \"I am so happy with the way the Lord has blessed me, I will do anything to show him.\" Forgetting the presence of the others, Jake answered, \"Oh, Patty Lou, you good-for-nothing Honey Chile. I been waiting for this moment all my life, and that's a right smart spell.\" Nestling one hand in his, the girl gave her father the other. Looking about to include them all she said simply, \"You are my family.\" Niels' eyes had said the same thing to Helga. Little Anna had awakened, and she passed from her father FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 99 to Helga and back again many times. Niels had a wagon and ox team now, and a cow he had lead all the way from Nauvoo. Being a property owner had given a new proud lift to his shoulders. Only Ann Kristin was alone. So very much alone, she told herself as she picked snags of wool from the brush. Matt Lewis had come in with the wagon train but she had not seen him. For all she knew he might have brought a wife with him. Even so, she was deeply affected by what the Turners had said of him. He was a true son of his father. There would never be any doubt of his integrity, nor of his devotion to the cause. The girl who married him would be lead inevitably into the celestial kingdom. Perhaps he wasn't married, but would go on tomorrow with the freight. He was working with Jake between the settlements and Fort Bridger. SUDDENLY Ann Kristin realized she was miles from camp. In all directions there was nothing but hot sky and brown prairie. A tremor of apprehension went through her. There might be Indians lurking near. She had been following a dry water course, now she walked to the top of a short rise and looked about. To the southwest a spiral of dust was rising as if in warning. She dropped abruptly to the ground and watched from behind the brush. She would have to crawl back down and find a hiding place?if there was a hiding place. It was a single horseman, and as she watched her fear vanished. It was a white man. Probably a scout, or some one following the sheep, for he seemed to be looking for some one. Several times he rose in the stirrups and looked about. Ann Kristin rose and waved. Instantly the rider saw and came galloping toward her. It was Matt Lewis. He stropped his horse and sprang to the ground. \"What do you mean coming out here alone?\" he demanded. \"Don't you know there are Indians? You might get lost.\" \"Is that what you came out here to tell me?\" \"Someone had to tell you.\" \"If you came out here to quarrel-.\" \"Who's quarreling? You?.\" They both stopped abruptly. He lifted his hat and ran his finger through his damp hair. It was the same hat he had worn the first time she had seen him. \"You are thin,\" he said unexpectedly. \"Why shouldn't I be? We walked from Montrose. Your mother helped haul our things. We were fortunate not to have to carry them.\" \"Next time there will be room to ride. I have a wagon and team of my own now. Jake and I are hauling freight.\" \"Yes, I know. Jake told us.\" For the life of her she could think of nothing else to say. Her torn faded dress, her worn shoes, the bag of greasy wool embarrassed her. She was holding on to the bag with her bad hand. It was no longer withered but it would always be a little stiff. \"Did you??\" she began, \"No,\" he read her thought, \"but it is no longer important. I found out all I needed to know.\" He had been holding the bridle reins. Now he looped them over his arm. His gaze wandered a moment as if he were searching for words. '1 found your money box/ he said, abruptly. \"You found it!\" He nodded. \"Not the money, naturally. One of the saints had bought it from Bedloe. It was a good strong box and evidently he could not resist the price it would bring. How he got it off the boat we probably will never know, nor how they managed to open the trunk without arousing suspicion. We knew it was yours by the initials of your father carved on the inside. Jake and I visited Wilkins. We made sure he did not see us coming this time. Under pressure he confessed. Bedloe was the leader of an organized band of thieves. Some of them, like himself, posed as saints to more easily win the confidence of the unsuspecting immigrants. But we did not find Bedloe.\" Then Ann Kristin knew, too, that the affair was no longer important. What was important was her changed attitude, her increased strength. The sudden knowledge that men like Matthew Lewis could always be trusted. She could touch suspicion and still know faith, one could accept trials and still know peace. She could be friends with Matt. \"You know now that I signed the paper innocently?\" Instead of answering Matt looked at her. His gray eyes were reddened by wind and sun. Dust lay a hard veneer over his features, but the hardness of distrust was gone. He spoke simply. \"T have always loved you, Ann Kristin, from that first moment on the wharf.\" Color drained from her face. She let the wool fall. He stepped closer. \"Could you?I'm not polished like Bedloe, I have nothing to offer you.\" \"You have everything,\" she raised her eyes to him and wondered at her own temerity. \"You have the Priesthood, heritage, honor, and a great kindness. Perhaps with you. Matt, I could forget the selfishness of my past.\" With a whoop of joy he caught her up and swung her about as he had his mother. Then he set her down abruptly and almost timidly took her in his arms. Later, from the pocket of his faded flannel shirt he took a small object wrapped in buckskin. \"Mother's ring,\" she cried out and reached for it. \"Where did you find it?\" With one hand he held her back. His grin reminded her of the day she had seen him teasing his mother. \"This is mine. I got it from Wilkins the same night he took it from you. I gave him five dollars and defied him to refuse to sell. I think he knew then I was suspicious. He didn't dare squawk.\" \"Oh, my dear, as scarce as money was?and you have kept it all this time.\" \"I knew this hour would come. I had to know it.\" He slipped the ring on her finger and then held her hand in both of his. She looked at the ring and tears brightened her eyes. \"All our lovely things are gone. Except this.\" \"But you have something much better. Strength and fortitude, and understanding.\" His compliment was so similar to hers she started to laugh. His smile FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 101 widened and then they were both laughing. Quick spontaneous laughter that brought back the lines of youth to their faces. He tied the wool on the saddle and they walked back to camp, savoring the minutes together. There was so much to talk about and their hands kept touching. \"We will be married tomorrow' he said at length. \"Mother will be very happy. She sent me to find you. You can stay with her until we get settled, or would you rather be with Helga?\" \"With your mother, then you can be with both of us between trips.\" \"I am not sure how long the trips will last. Much depends on what the body of the Church does. We can't settle here permanently. The saints are leaving Nauvoo and vicinity as fast as they can dispose of their property, and get wagons or carts to haul their few belongings. All must be gone by spring. Those in power have decreed it, which makes it much harder to sell anything. Especially land. Now Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri are petitioning the Federal Government at Washington to refuse us permission to settle within the confines of their boundaries.\" \"But where can we go?\" \"Brother Young is asking permission to settle in the Far West. That would entail much planning and more suffering. If there is a place of rest we will find it. I hope it will be next year. Take mother, for example. It is seven years since she gave up her home. In all that time she hasn't really been settled.\" \"BUT the trouble of the saints was soon forgotten. They talked as young people in all ages have talked. The past was forgotten and the future was not yet upon them. Only the present was theirs. So short a present. A mile from camp two men came riding hard out of the west. Matt stopped and his hand went to his gun. Even when he saw they were white men he did not relax. \"What news?\" he asked as they pulled in their lathering horses. \"Plenty. Brother Young is behind us. He wants to meet all the men.\" They were off again, and now the future was upon Ann Kristin and Matthew. The old sickening apprehension swept over her. His lips closed to a hard straight line, and his steps quickened. As they entered camp, they saw the buggy approaching. They stopped until it passed. Brother Young and two other men were in it. \"Go on,\" Ann Kristin told him. \"I?ll take the wool home. You can tell me later.\" Without a word he hurried away. Holding to the bridle reins she led the horse past tents, shanties, and wagons. Before her own home she tied the horse to a wagon wheel and removed the wool and saddle. There was no one around. Even the Turners were gone, except Jinny and she soon left. \"Why don't you-all come to the meetin\"?\" she asked. \"Everybody is goin'.\" Ann Kristin refused. She felt the necessity of fortifying herself for Matt's return. If the news were bad ?but she closed her mind to it. Perhaps the meeting meant they could settle in the Rocky Mountains, or even stay here. That would be wonerful, She took up her knitting, but as time passed her fingers moved faster and faster. Surely, surely, the Lord would not try them longer, but why didn't Matt come, or Hel-ga, or some one? When she could stand the suspense no longer she got up and moved about. She was too tired to walk. Succumbing to a sudden whim she decided to dress up and go to the meeting. From a trunk she took the dress she had worn the day she left the River Maid. The one that had made her appear \"over-decorated.\" She had not worn it since that day. She shook it out and ran a cold flatiron over it. The shoes were there, too, and the hat. She arranged her hair as it had been. When she had finished she surveyed herself in the small mirror she had. What she saw was not too reassuring, but such things as wrinkles and coarse rough hands were minor annoyances. Remembrance and expectation supplied what poverty and primitive conditions failed to grant. The transformation was complete even to the ring on her finger. For a moment she looked at it, then raised it to her lips and kissed it softly. Gathering her skirt in both hands she started for the meeting. \"Kristie.\" \"Oh,\" she dropped her skirt. Matt was standing in the doorway. His eyes lighted at the bridal picture before him, but love could not entirely erase the bleakness from his eyes. She moved quickly to him. His smile faded. \"Is it a mob or an order?or do we stay here?\" she asked breathlessly- \"Neither. It is war. War with Mexico.\" \"But what has that to do with us? Surely after the way we have been refused homes?.\" \"the Government would not expect us to help protect others' homes? Yes, it expects just that, and it is our country, Kristin. Brother Young is here with an army man to get recruits. Jake and Ezra have volunteered.\" \"But?but we are to be married. We have been unhappy so long.\" Matt stepped inside. He put his arms about her shoulders and drew her close. He tilted her chin so their eyes met. Her hat fell off but neither noticed. \"Let me explain, dear.\" \"Yes?but, oh Matt, not now. Not when you have work and?.\" \"I must go. Try to understand. An older man, Niels perhaps, can do my freighting. The army pays seven dollars a month for privates, besides the clothes issued. I was a top sergeant in the Nauvoo Legion. I am hoping Captain Allen will give me a rating. If I go, other young men will go.\" \"How many do they want?\" \"Five hundred. Think what seven dollars a month coming to five hundred of our homes could mean.\" \"But war! Life is ours now. You can't throw it away now. War is brutal and savage. There are Indians, and Mexico, where is Mexico? Matt, I may never see you again.\" \"Yes, it may even mean that. Even so, we have nothing to fear. The future is all ours.\" \"I want the present. Matt, don't go. Don't ask me for another sacrifice.\" \"Where is your strength, your faith?\" FORWARD, WITHOUT FEAR 103 \"1 haven't any strength. I haven't any faith. I don't want any. I want you.\" For a long minute he held her close trying to still the trembling of her body, but he said nothing. She laid her face against the rough cloth of his shirt. When she raised her eyes to him, the youth and gaiety were gone from them, \"I am all right now/' she said quietly. \"When do you go?\" \"Tonight. Now.\" 'Tonight?\" \"We must be in Council Bluffs by the sixteenth. It will take hard marching to reach there by then.\" \"And the others?\" \"Niels and Helga, Jake and Patty Lou are being married by Brother Young. They wanted to send for you, but I wanted these few minutes with you alone.\". -But-but-.\" \"There is no time for that for us.\" He took her hand and slipped the ring from her finger. Then he put it back. \"Our lives are like this ring. They are not to be lived in a straight line from one year to another, but in a circle, from eternity to eternity. There is no end to them, so we shall never be apart, not days, nor deserts, nor Indians can separate us for long. 1 will be back.\" After a moment she answered, \"I know you will. I'll go to your mother. And you will come there, wherever our home is.\" The clear note of a bugle came to them. With a prayer in her heart and a smile on her lips she watched him stride away. She turned quickly then to put together her few belongings. Niels and Helga would want this cabin. She and Sister Lewis would go on together without fear. She whispered the last aloud. THE END FEBRUARY Leone E. McCune Ghostlike February, In your tattered gown. Hovering sad and lonely, Trailing up and down. You drift in the hollow 'Neath the moonlit hill. You shriek around the corner, Weep upon my sill. I hear you at dawning; Moaning sad and low, Wandering like a lost soul. Knows not where to go. You will follow winter When the sun rides high, And pussy willows unfold To a clear blue sky."

With the strain of this present time weighing heavily upon the women of the mission, the lessons and work outlined by the General Board is more and more appreciated. The constant visits and need for home life by servicemen from many nations is being met by the women within the mission in a most admirable manner. The mission home, alone, gives relaxation to literally scores each month. Many of the sisters are doing their best to relieve the situation by opening their own homes, and have done so for many months. It is a wonderful labor and a very happy work. We appreciate more than we can ever tell the contact we have with the sons of so many mothers at home. Ninety-nine per cent of those mothers in Zion can rest assured that their sons are clean before the Lord; this same thing can be said of those mothers who have daughters in the services. We get to know them very well in their visits, we have them living and eating and praying, studying and relaxing with us, and their Page 104 attitudes and their worth speak well for the homes from which they come. The groups they form in advanced bases and the difficulties they surmount to form those groups is a living testimony of the fine homes from which they have come. Their devotion and desire to make contact with the Church upon arrival is a healthy sign. It is impossible to write an individual letter or history concerning each because they come and go so quickly, but such sons and daughters speak well for the women of the Church who are their mothers. I do not wish to depreciate the brethren who are the fathers in any way, but I am speaking only as a woman and knowing the program of the Relief Society, I think it is good, once in a while, to view the fruits of those who belong to this society.\" California Mission MRS. GLYDE BOOTHE, president of the Laguna Beach Relief Society, wrote recently: \"Laguna Beach is a very picturesque little city, situated on the shores of the beautiful blue Pacific. The hills form a wonderful background, with lovely homes trailing to the upmost top of them. \"We were organized September 6, NOTES FROM THE FIELD 105 ALEXANDRIA RELIEF SOCIETY, TEXAS MISSION Missionaries Lewis R. And Laura M. Jenkins are in center, front row 1942, with 13 members; today we have 14 members and 13 subscriptions to TheWe are fully organized. In 1943, we held a bazaar and made $105.50; in 1944, we cleared $300 at our bazaar. We start the first of the year and make certain things each month; for example, January, pot holders; February, aprons; March and April, dish towels; May and June, baby clothes; July, luncheon cloths; August, scarfs; September and October, pillow cases; November, miscellaneous. In this way our sewing has been a tremendous success. All credit goes to the members and the wonderful helpers I have.\" Texas Mission LAURA M. JENKINS, returning short-term missionary, brought to the General Board, during 1944, the accompanying picture of the Alexandria Relief Society, and a history from which the following excerpts are quoted: In the five years since organization of this Relief Society in 1938, we have organized a Singing Mothers' chorus, have canned six hundred cans of fruits and vegetables; have given bazaars; put on rummage sales; given box suppers; made candy and sold it, standing on the street corners, for ten cents a bag, until we raised approximately $300. When sugar was rationed we were given special permission to solicit various business houses, and raised $700 in this way in 1943. With this $1000, matched by the Church, we purchased a six-room residence for a meeting place. Throughout the five years, there have sometimes been from five to six women meeting regularly, and more often two and three; there have even been times when the president was alone. There have been four presidents of this organization: Sisters Melhus, Viola Armond, Rhoda Mae Jones, and Bertha Wehner. AUSTIN RELIEF SOCIETY, TEXAS MISSION President Ruth Paris is standing in the back row, second from left. We now have a fully organized society with a membership of seventeen.\" La Verne Walsh, secretary-treasurer of the Austin Branch Relief Society wrote in August 1944: \"Early this year our Society held a rummage sale and a bazaar the proceeds from which totaled approximately $125. We contributed $25 to our Church Building Fund, and it is a source of pleasure to our Relief Society that we have never failed to donate a part of the proceeds of every project to this Building Fund. We are holding two work meetings a month this summer, and these are devoted to working on articles for our next bazaar. \"In accordance with the Church Welfare Program, we have given much of our time to quilting, and this year have completed two quilts and have quilted one for a member. The quilting for members is one of our projects for the year. These quiltings are always enjoyable affairs, since we combine them with covered dish luncheons, and when the spirit of love, and friendship, and co-operation is added, then we have treasured memories in addition to a wonderful work well done. We should like, also, to voice our appreciation to the wives of the army and navy men, for giving their time and their talents to our Society.\" Northwestern States Mission TN April 1944, before her release as president of the Relief Societies of the Northwestern States Mission, Edna H. Bennion submitted the accompanying picture and following statement: \"With the growth of war industries, many Latter-day Saints have come to the Northwest to work. Through the efforts of the missionaries a number of branches of the Church have been organized. In many places, they have started with NOTES FROM THE FIELD 107 RELIEF SOCIETY OF VANPORT, OREGON, NORTHWESTERN STATES MISSION (NOW IN PORTLAND STAKE) a Sunday School and a Relief Society. Such a Relief Society is the one at Vanport, Oregon, a housing area just outside of Portland. All of the women in the organization live at Vanport and many of them work in the Kaiser shipyards where their husbands are employed. They meet at 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning so they can be home in time to have dinner ready for their husbands as they come off day shift and the women go on the swing shift. They are all doing their bit to win this war, but they haven't lost their desire to meet at Relief Society. The Vanport Branch has grown to a complete organization of happy, faithful saints.\" This branch has since been transferred to the Portland Stake. Central States Mission THE following reports from five branches of this mission were all submitted during the forepart of 1944. Their mission Relief Society president is Lydia Ann M. Romney. May Kipp, president of Dodge City (Kansas) Branch Relief Society, wrote March 14, 1944: *'We were organized in the fall of 1940 with myself as president and Sisters Pauline Parsons and Louise Davis as counselors. We held our first bazaar a week before Christmas with very good success. We took in $35 which was an achievement as it established the bazaar idea within our group until we now sell handmade articles to many regular customers. We are selling a good many baby clothes at this time, and we, as a group, heartily endorse the idea of holding bazaars and keeping ready-made garments on hand. We have also made a good many surgical dressings and also cookies for the U.S.O.\" Ada Van Dam, president of the Fort Sill (Oklahoma) Relief Society, submitted the following statement prepared by Mary G. Matheson: \"Fort Sill is the largest field artillery school in the United States. DODGE CITY RELIEF SOCIETY, CENTRAL STATES MISSION (Picture taken in 1942). Many Latter-day Saint men are stationed here and consequently\" a goodly number of wives have accompanied their husbands from Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Arizona and other states. \"We have organized a splendid branch, and the attendance at our Sunday School and the evening sacrament services rivals various Protestant gatherings held on the post. The services are conducted by army personnel as there are no civilian members located in this vicinity. With more of our brethren being stationed here, the number of vives coming out has increased, and many expressed their desire for a Relief Society. Ada Van Dam and Olive Phillips were instrumental in organizing our group under the direction of the Central States Mission. 'The first meeting was held in September 1943, with about ten sisters present. Our membership now averages twenty-three at every meeting. As we have no chapel of our own, our meetings are held in various members' homes once a week. \"We are probably the youngest group, in age, of any Relief Society in the Church. Many of our sisters are attending out here for the first time in their lives. The majority are newly married and are about twenty-two years of age. \"The lessons as outlined in Theare being followed and we all take turns instructing. It is a grand group, and the association with each other is doing much for all of us who are away from our homes in these troubled times. The branch is our mainstay, and we look forward eagerly to each meeting. \"Our Relief Society is responsible for beginning and continuing to hold socials once a month for all Mormons here. The young fellows in the army await anxiously the announcement of the next social. We had a Christmas banquet. New Year's Eve party, Valentine dance, and are planning another dance for March.

They are all from Salt Lake except Olive Phillips who is from Lehi, Utah.\" Shirley B. Paxman, a counselor in Wichita Branch (Kansas) Relief Society, wrote April 5,1944: I've been meaning to express appreciation to you for the wonderful Relief Society lessons we've had this year. Everyone has commented on how fine they are, and they have all enjoyed them, especially this winter. I've been teaching the Bible literature lessons this past year and every one has been a joy to prepare. The material in all the lessons is handled so well that I'm sure it accounts for the increased interest and attendance at our meeting. At home I rather thought the Relief Society was for the older women, but I find I was mistaken since being active in the organization here. Though our membership is comparatively small we've accomplished a great deal. We've quilted one quilt; made two wool afghans of crocheted wool blocks made from old dresses and suits, which we donated to the Red Cross for convalescent soldiers; had a victory garden from which we sold the produce and canned for members; held a rummage sale this winter which netted us $65 profit; redecorated the two rooms at the Church used by the missionaries; and other things. On March 17, we held a covered-dish supper and program at the church for all members of the Church and friends in commemoration of the 102nd anniversary of the Relief Society. RELIEF SOCIETY OF LITTLE ROCK BRANCH (ARKANSAS), CENTRAL STATES MISSION The officers, President Bessie Wilhite and Counselors Mary G. Wiggins and Lanoi Rowe are delighted with the good attendance which has been increased by wives of servicemen. The General Board has certainly done a magnificent piece of work in making the Relief Society program so timely and interesting to women all over the Church. We've found that the Relief Society has been an excellent missionary in this branch in getting nonmembers of the Church interested. Several of our Relief Society members do not belong to the Church as yet, but we feel sure they will soon.\" Maye Housley, secretary-treasurer of Oklahoma City Branch Relief Society, wrote last April: \"Commemorating the Relief Society anniversary, a banquet was given March 18 by the Priesthood of our branch in honor of the Relief Society members. It was held in the Venetian Room of the Y. W. C. A. The Relief Society colors of blue and gold were used in table decorations. The theme \"Memories\" was carried out in the program. Our president is Dagmar Patterson, and counselors are Pearl Anderson and Grace Cullimore.\" A copy of the artistic printed program accompanying the write-up indicated that the entertainment included special musical numbers, a one-act play, and dancing. {To he continued)"

You, no doubt, will have many occasions to use it before the repair man comes around again. Take an inventory of what you have, to see if you can find the following: hammer (two sizes), screwdriver, a pair of pliers, a three-cornered file, a cross-cut saw, folding rule, small can of machine oil, scissors, jack knife, awl, rubber force pump 'plumber's friend', nails, screws, tacks, scraper for removing old paint, pipe wrench, friction tape, auger, turpentine, putty, plastic wood and paint brushes in good condition. You may need additional tools, but the above list is a good beginning. Good tools are a good investment. They are now very scarce, so it pays to take good care of what you have.\nElectrical Repairs?Caution. Remember that live wires are dangerous. Avoid handling electric cords, switches, etc., with wet hands. If you are repairing a wall outlet or switch, remove the fuse in the circuit.\nWhat to do when your lights go out?It may mean a blown-out fuse which indicates there is something wrong with the electrical equipment or the manner in which it is used. The fuse is a safety valve for the electrical system. It consists of a link of soft metal which melts and opens the circuit when too much current passes through the wires. If it fails to operate, the wires in the walls would become overheated, char the insulation and possibly cause fire.\nFuses must never be tampered with. Keep all electrical equipment in good repair and avoid overloading the circuit.\nHow to replace a fuse. First, find the cause and remove it. The blown-out fuse will have a cracked or blackened \"window.\" Disconnect the lamp or appliance responsible. Touching only the fuse, grasp it by the rim, unscrew it. Screw in a new one and close the switch. Never use pliers. If you are timid about handling fuses, pull the main switch, usually located near the fuse box. Buy only fuses which carry the laboratories' inspection label. Remember, the proper rating of a fuse is determined by the size of the wire to be protected. Keep an extra supply of fuses of the proper rating on hand at all times. Your power company will give you all the necessary information.\nFaucets. The most common repair any home owner can make is to repair a leaking faucet. First disconnect the water supply. Grasp the faucet handle firmly in one hand, using the wrench in the other to unscrew the nut around the faucet. A piece of cloth or paper inserted between the nut and the wrench protects the faucet from bite-marks. When the faucet handle comes out, bring with it the defective washer, unloosen the screw at the center of the washer, using a screwdriver. If the screw should stick, apply a few drops of oil and give it a few taps. When replacing the new washer, buy one, turning the dull side toward the supply pipe. Replace the screw on the handle shaft and tighten nut. Composition washers may now be purchased which serve for both the hot and cold taps.\nSinks and Toilets. In order to repair the valves by which water enters and leaves the flush tanks of toilets, one needs to study the inside mechanism of the tank. It is very simple. Any plumbing supply house will be glad to show you. Any one can learn to use a \"plumber's friend\" or suction plunge. This handy tool is indispensable for clearing sluggish drains. The ball should be half submerged and worked up and down. Drains should be cared for when the first signs of clogging appear. Sometimes it is advisable to use a commercial flushing chemical. If so, always follow the direction on the can very carefully.\nLeaky Pipes need a plumber. Temporary menders of pipes: putty, cement, friction tape or adhesive plaster wound round enough times usually stop the leak. These are only temporary measures, however, and will not last long. If the water pipe becomes frozen never apply a blow torch. The sudden heat may burst it. Apply cloths soaked in hot water. This method is slow but perfectly safe. Become familiar with the water system in your home so you will know how to turn the water off in case of an emergency. If a leak in the ceiling occurs, first, shut off the water supply; second, take an awl or ice pick and bore a hole through the ceiling where the water is dripping and relieve the plaster of the load above. This has saved many a large plastering bill.\nYour gas pilot. If the pilot goes out close the main gas shut-off valve.\nTry to do this with a piece of fine wire. The flame may be too small. If so, increase it by turning the adjusting screw to the left.\nSticking windows are unnecessary. Check the runways for signs of wear and lubricate by rubbing them with paraffin or candle grease. Secondly, examine the adjustable \"stop\" strips which hold the sash in place, they may need a little loosening. Third. If the house trim has been recently painted be sure to remove any paint that might have dried between the sash. If a door squeaks put a little machine oil on the top of the hinges. Swing the door back and forth in order to get the oil to run down the hinge pin. Repeat if necessary.\nA broken table leg can be mended with a dowel pin glued into holes bored into each section of the break. In order to do this, holes will have to be made in each of the broken pieces. These holes should be less than one-third of the diameter of the leg and about one and one-half inches deep. The dowel should be as long as the holes. Sometime chair legs become loose. If the legs are bolted on, tightening the nuts may be all that's needed. If they are screwed on, the frame may be tight enough by driving the screws in farther with a screw driver or resetting them. Fill the holes with glue or plastic wood before resetting. If the rungs in a chair become loose, one of the best methods of repair is to use metal rung fasteners which are sold at hardware stores. These are inexpensive, hold firmly, and are simpler to use than glue. These fasteners are hammered into the rung and when the rung is replaced they lock in firmly.

To Moses came the word, \"There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee. Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God. For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do. The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. But the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken? When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shall not be afraid of him.\" (Deut. 18:10-15, 19-22). The words of a true prophet will come to pass. Not since the days of the apostles in the meridian of time had the Lord raised up a prophet according to this pattern, until, upon that spring morning in the year of 1820, when the young Joseph Smith put to a Page 113 test the power of godliness. From that day on, for a period of some twenty-four years?the remaining time of mortal life allotted to this Prophet of the Lord?there lived among men one accepted of God, worthy to receive his word in opening the dispensation of the fulness of times. Within that short quarter of a century, there lived a modern seer whose contact with the Almighty was so close that the very whisperings of his voice were unmistakable.\nWhat were the words of this leader of mortal Israel, and how did he deliver them? Were any of his associates ever present during the times revelations came? How would they know he was truly \"in the spirit\" and not obsessed as a \"charmer of wizard\"? What of his countenance, his voice, under such visionary experiences? As for the supreme test, when he spoke in the name of the Lord did the thing of which he spoke ever come to pass within the lives of those who heard? These and dozens of similar questions will flood the mind of an earnest seeker after truth today, just as they did when Joseph the Prophet himself walked among men.\nWe do have the answers to these and many other questions like them now; first, in the recorded words of the men and women who lived with and knew the Prophet intimately; and second, in the unfailing and literal fulfillment of many of his prophecies within the lives of those who heard them uttered.\nWithin the limited words allotted for these lessons, it is impossible to include even a hundredth part of the many facts now on record which bear testimony of the divine calling of Joseph Smith. We must therefore include but a few more widely known and readily appreciated about the Prophet's way of receiving revelations, as well as some of the timely predictions he gave which now we can look back upon with wonder.\nFor an account of the Prophet's appearance we may turn to the words of Parley P. Pratt: \"President Joseph Smith was in person tall and well built, strong and active, of a light complexion, light hair, blue eyes, very little beard, and of an expression peculiar to himself, on which the eye naturally rested with interest, and was never weary of beholding. His countenance was ever mild, affable, beaming with intelligence and benevolence; mingled with a look of interest and an unconscious smile, a cheerfulness, and entirely free from all restraint or affection of gravity; and there was something connected with the serene and penetrating glance of his eye, as if he would penetrate the deepest abyss of the human heart, gaze into eternity, penetrate the heavens, and comprehend all worlds.\n\"He possessed a noble boldness and independence of character; his manner was easy and familiar; his rebuke terrible as the lion; his benevolence unbounded as the ocean; his intelligence universal, and his language abounding in original eloquence, peculiar to himself?not polished?not studied?not smoothed and softened by education and refined by art; but flowing forth in its own native simplicity, and profusely abounding in variety of subject and manner. He interested and edified, while at the same time, he amused and entertained his audience; and none listened to him that were ever weary with his discourse. I have even known him to retain a congregation of willing and anxious listeners for many hours together, in the midst of cold or sunshine, rain or wind, while they were laughing at one moment, and weeping the next. Even his most bitter enemies were overcome, generally, if he could once get their ears. (Doc. and Cov. Commentary, pp. 18,19).\nFrom the book Stories About Joseph Smith the Prophet, pp. 166-168, compiled by Edwin F. Parry, we read the following, describing the manner in which the Prophet looked when receiving and dictating a revelation: \"The early day Apostle Parley P. Pratt has left on record the Prophet's mode of giving revelations. Elder Pratt and some others called upon Joseph respecting some evil spirit manifestations which they had observed in a certain branch of the Church. Their desire was to know what might be done to banish the evil. While these brethren were with the Prophet he inquired of the Lord about the matter. After we had joined in prayer in his translating room,' writes Elder Pratt, 'he dictated in our presence the following revelation: (Doc. and Cov. 50). Each sentence was uttered slowly, and very distinctly and with a pause between each, sufficiently long for it to be recorded by an ordinary writer, in longhand. This was the manner in which all his written revelations were dictated and written. There was never any hesitation, reviewing, or reading back, in order to keep the run of the subject; neither did any of these communications undergo revisions, interlining or corrections. As he dictated them so they stood, so far as I have witnessed; and I was present to witness the dictation of several communications of several pages each.\"\n\"Commenting on this description of the manner in which revelations were given to the Prophet, the History of the Church [Vol. 1, page 173] has this to say: 'This statement of Elder Pratt's is true in a general way, and valuable as a description of the manner in which revelations were dictated by the Prophet; and needs modifying only to the extent of saying that some of the early revelations first published in the \"Book of Commandments\" in 1833, were revised by the Prophet himself in the copy of correcting errors made by the scribes and publishers; and some additional clauses were inserted to throw light upon the subjects treated in the revelations, and paragraphs added, to make the principles or instructions apply to officers not in the Church at the time some of the earlier revelations were given.'\"\nMore, too, was given by this Prophet of the Lord than the revelations recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. Joseph was also known as a seer. Because he possessed this rare gift, he could foretell the coming of great events. Possibly the one event most widely remembered, of which he spoke is the prophecy concerning the establishment of the saints in the Far West. Here is a prophecy which came to pass within the lives of many who heard it uttered.\nAgain from the Stories About Joseph Smith, pp. 113-118: \"Joseph Smith's Journal, as contained in the History of the Church [Vol. V, pp. 85-86], has this entry under date of August 6, 1842: 'Passed over the river (from Nauvoo, Illinois) to Montrose, Iowa.... [had a conversation with a number of brethren in the shade of the building on the subject of our persecutions in Missouri and the constant annoyance which has followed us since we were driven from that state. \"? prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease, and some of you will live to go and assist in making settlements and build cities and see the saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.  \"?Among those present when this prediction was uttered was Elder Anson Call, who has left on record additional details respecting this remarkable prediction. He says that in the shade of the building mentioned was a barrel of ice water and the men were drinking it to quench their thirst on that hot August day. The Prophet warned the brethren not to be too free with it. What follows is in Elder Calls own words: \"With the tumbler still in his hand he prophesied that the Saints would yet go to the Rocky Mountains; 'and,' said he, 'this water tastes much like that of the crystal streams that are running from the snowcapped mountains.' \"I had before seen him in a vision, and now saw, while he was talking, his countenance change to white; not the deathly white of a bloodless face, but a living brilliant white. He seemed absorbed in gazing at something at a great distance, and said 1 am gazing upon the valleys of those mountains.' This was followed by a vivid description of the scenery of these mountains, as I have since become acquainted with it. \"Pointing to Shadrach Roundy and others, he said: 'There are some men here who shall do a great work in that land.' Pointing to me, he said: There is Anson, he shall go and shall assist in building up cities from one end of the country to the other, and you' (rather extending the idea to all those he had spoken of) 'shall perform as great a work as has been done by man; so that the nations. Of the earth shall be astonished; and many of them will be gathered in that land and assist in building cities and temples, and Israel shall be made to rejoice.' \"It was impossible to represent in words this scene, which is still vivid in my mind, of the grandeur of Joseph's appearance, his beautiful descriptions of this land and his wonderful prophetic utterances as they emanated from the glorious inspiration that overshadowed him. \"The subsequent history of the Latter-day Saints attests the fulfillment of that remarkable prediction.... That part of the prophecy relative to what Anson Call would do in the settlement of the valleys of the mountains,... Was literally fulfilled also. When Call came to Utah he first located in what is now Davis County. In 1850 he settled in Little Salt Lake Valley and also in Parowan. He then moved to the northern part of Utah, but was called to take charge of a colonizing company to settle in Pauvan Valley. In 1851 he assisted in founding Fillmore in Millard County. In 1854 he established Call's Fort; and in 1856 LESSON DEPARTMENT 117 he was sent to Carson Valley, Nevada, on a colonizing expedition. In 1858 he returned to Utah and in 1864 he was colonizing in Colorado and southwestern Utah.\" For him who would know the truth of God's promise given in Deuteronomy concerning a prophet, there stands today as solemn witness the Church of Jesus Christ.. Its members, the Latter-day Saints, bear testimony by the thousands of the fulfillment of God's word through the instrumentality of the modern Seer and Prophet Joseph Smith. If this man stood alone in a knowledge of the power of godliness upon the threshold of that day in the spring of 1820, there now has come a great host to join his company. After more than a century, an ever-swelling multitude of human souls affirm quietly, but with deep conviction, that the voice Joseph never forgot had put words in his mouth from heaven, both true and eternal. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word\" which has been written especially for our life in this day. 1. How can a permanent peace be established? Read carefully section 87 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Note the date of this prophecy as compared to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. The teacher should make full use of the notes following this section as found in the Doctrine and Covenants Commentary. Read the general notes found on page 1009 in the Doctrine and Covenants Commentary concerning Judge Stephen A. Douglas. Study in the following books will add enrichment to this lesson: The Introduction to the Doctrine and Covenants Commentary; Stones About Joseph Smith the Prophet compiled by Edwin F. Parry; and The Prophecies of Joseph Smith and Their Fulfillment by Nephi L. Morris. The teacher might well assign to each of several class members to be prepared with one story concerning the prophetic utterances of Joseph Smith. Let the year's work end on this note: At this, the end of a year's study concerning the early history of the coming forth of the Church, how more deeply are you ready \"to know that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God\"? Visiting Teaching Messages Sources of Strength?The Beatitudes * Lesson 8?Blessed Are They Which Are Persecuted for Righteousness' Sake Elder Bryant S. Hinckley For Tuesday, May i, 1945 \"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven (Matt $: io). \"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.\" (Matt. 5:11-12) Objective: To show that those who courageously stand for righteousness are often the victims of persecution, but such persecution is often the pathway to spiritual growth and those who stand firm under such persecution are heirs to the kingdom of heaven. Literature New Testament Lesson 8?Revelation of John the Divine (A Rhapsody of the Millenium) Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, May 15, 1945 ISAIAH in the Rhapsody of Zion Redeemed,\" visions with ecstatic hope the coming of the Messiah. This prophetic masterpiece, created when Israel was in travail, brought promise of relief and redemption through a Savior of mankind. John, the beloved disciple, banished to the lonely Isle of Patmos, was given, by the risen Christ, a vision of the millenium. Like Isaiah, he portrayed in rhapsody, what his exalted soul saw and felt. Only through such a blend of lofty types of literature, could he rise to the majesty of the theme.\nRhapsodic writings were in the mode of those days with Hebrews and early Christians. To impress burning messages of truth, or visions, those of prophetic spirit would sometimes fuse drama, lyrics, odes, oratory, and other forms of literature into a unified expression of their theme. The result was what Dr. Moulton has aptly called a rhapsody.\nIn the study of this type of Hebraic literature, one should remember that it is a central theme the author would impress. One must first get the spirit and meaning of the whole. This gained, it will be easier to understand the parts, so far as they will yield to our finite understanding.\nIt is hardly possible that all, or any of us, can understand the spiritual significance of every line of Isaiah or Revelation. Nor is it fruitless to be over-analytical of these or other masterful works of literature. As Dean Baliet, in cautioning teachers against such practices, put it, \"One cannot get at the meaning of sorrow by making a chemical analysis of a tear.\" Our leaders have often advised against our delving too much into the mysteries. Let these unfold in the Lord's own good time.\nOur part, now, is first to get the major message of the Revelation of John the Divine. A reading of this sacred scripture as a whole, with prayerful heart, will surely bring this to us. Every part of the prophetic book brings out directly or indirectly the living truth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer and Ruler of the World; and that those who are faithful in living the gospel as he taught and lived it, will partake of the glories with him in the millenium. Necessary limitations of this study permit only an overview of the sacred book, with an inlook into some of its impressive imagery and stirring lines. *Isaiah, chapter 49 to end. The vision opens with John seeing the Savior in power, and receiving his words of council to be passed on to the seven churches of Asia. In essence, it is stern but kindly admonition for them to forsake evil, hold to the truth, and be ardent for righteousness. \"Behold,\" the prologue closes, \"I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches\" (Revelation 3:20-22). An impressionistic vision of heaven follows. \"It takes...\" says Dr. Moulton, \"the form of three symbolic pictures passing one into the other like dissolving views.\" First, Deity supreme is manifested \"on a. Throne surrounded by a rainbow,\" while all grades of authority and all forms of life move in a ceaseless round of adoration. Then a book sealed with seven seals becomes visible in the hand of enthroned Deity\" (Modern Reader's Bible, page 1708). None, it is felt, can unseal the mysterious volume; but a promise comes that the Lion of Judah shall unseal it. Then appears not a lion, but a Lamb: and as the Lamb takes the book, \"ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands\" voice their praise of him in unison saying: Worthy is the Lamb... To receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea.,, heard I saying. Blessing and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever\" (Revelation 5:12, 13). After this song of adoration comes the breaking of the seals of the mysterious book. And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse: he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say. Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.... (Revelation 6:1-8). These were the four famed horses and horsemen of the Apocalypse signifying. Captivity, War, Famine and Death. How often since the days of this vision of John, have these elements of destruction gone forth to conquer, to fight, to dole out a pittance of food to the starving, to spread death! How tragically applicable is this dramatic picture to our war-torn world today! LESSON DEPARTMENT 121 The fifth seal broken, John \"saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony that they held: And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.\" One can sense here the feeling of John himself in the shadow of death, as he thought back of the martyrs for Christ, and those that yet would suffer death for his gospel. Yet the beloved Apostle looked beyond the clouds and the wrath of God. With the breaking of the sixth seal, comes the opening of destructions upon the world. And while the earth quakes and mountains and islands are moved out of their place, and men, high and low, hide themselves in dens and rocks, John sees the protecting angels holding back the destructive forces until other angels shall place the saving seal on the foreheads of the servants of God. The Revelation continues: These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.... They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;.. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes (Revelation 7:14-17). As these buoyed up hearts of suffering saints of those earlier days. They have brought comfort and courage to the righteous of all time. When the seventh seal of the book was opened, \"there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.\" The vision continues: And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings and an earthquake. And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound (Rev. 8:2-6). Another dramatic portrayal follows of the woes that came upon the earth. Hail and fire, a darkening of the sun, smoke from the bottomless pit, locusts, scorpions, earthquakes and other plagues and calamities, spread terror and destruction. And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels. And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ....\" (Rev. 12:7-10). Satan does not cease his wicked work. In form of dragon and beast he reappears to lure men, to make them fear and worship him. He wars on the saints, overcomes them 'and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues and nations.. ' (Rev. 13:7)?all save those whose names are \"written in the book of life.\" John continues: And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth (Revelation 14:1-3). Following these and other lines of exaltation, descriptive of the pure in heart, comes a scriptural passage dear to every Latter-day Saint. And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. Saying with a loud voice. Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters (Revelations 14:6-7). Following these precious lines, prophetic of the restoration of the gospel of Christ in these latter days, come other oft-quoted words of scripture. Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them (Revelations 14:13). Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe (Revelation 14:15). After this is the vision John saw of the pouring out of the 'Vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.\" Destruction is meted to those who \"have shed the blood of saints and prophets,\" those who have \"blasphemed the name of God,\" and upon others steeped in sin. \"Babylon The Great, The Mother Oi Harlots and Abominations Of The Earth\" feels the fierceness of God's wrath: In flaming words (chapter 18), her fall is depicted: And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing,... For in one hour is she made desolate. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her\" (Rev. 18:19-20). In the light of terrible happenings today, it is not too difficult to visualize what John saw in vision nearly two thousand years ago. Triumph of righteousness follows destruction. Satan is bound. The millenium is ushered in. A new Jerusalem is portrayed in all its splendor? scorning down from God out of heaven.\" Christ reigns as \"King Of Kings And Lord Of Lords.\" Truly, in the Revelation of John the Divine, we have one of the four master Books of the Bible. From a literary viewpoint, it rises to the great heights of Deuteronomy, Job, and Isaiah. Milton, whose living spring of inspiration was the Bible, said of Revelation It is a majestic image of high and stately tragedy, shutting up and intermingling her solemn scenes and acts with a sevenfold chorus of hallelujahs and harping symphonies. LESSON DEPARTMENT 123 Ample illustrations of the appeal of its soul-stirring lines and its wondrous imagery, may be found in poetry, music, drama. Observe, for example, how John's portrayal of the New Jerusalem inspired this beautiful analogy in Longfellow's \"Courtship of Miles Standish\": Slowly as out of the heavens with apocalyptical splendors, Sank the City of God in the vision of John the Apostle, So, with its cloudy walls of chrysolite, jasper and sapphire, Sank the broad red sun and over its turrets uplifted, Glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city. ?(See Revelations 211 In its universal sweep, its emotional depth and height, the Rhapsody of the Millenium is majestic literature. More than this, it is saving scripture. Lifting lines, such as, \"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life,\" offer sustaining strength and comfort for the faithful. They hold hope for those who, despite unearned suffering and testing tragedy, keep their trust in God and their feet in the path of righteousness. Suggestions for Discussion and Activities 1. What, in brief, is the central theme of the Revelation of John the Divine? 2. Sketch the main parts in the development of the sacred theme. Give here just a brief line suggesting each; as, (a) Prologue: Message of Christ to the Seven Churches; (b) The Sealed Book of the Lamb. 3. Be prepared to read aloud one of these scenes from Revelation: (a) \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" (chap. 6:1-7); \"Adoration of the Saints\" (chap. 7:9-15); \"Seventh Angel Sounds his Trumpet\" (chap. 11:15-19); \"Michael and the Dragon\" (chap. 12:7-12); \"Announcement of the Everlasting Gospel\" (chap. 14:6-7); \"Fall of Babylon\" (chap. 18); \"Praise of the Saints for God\" (chap. 19:5-10); \"The New Jerusalem\" (chap. 21:1-8). 4. Procure the song \"The Holy City\" and read its lines; or better, have it sung. What inspired this song? 5. Be ready to give from Revelation some other musical lines that are woven into one of our hymns; or some other quotation from the Book that has brought uplift to you. Note: Use King James' translation as the basic text for this study of Revelation. Social Science Modern Applications of Ethical Principles Lesson 7?Brotherhood, the Key to Greatness Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, May 22, 1945 Lesson Link. Character, through honest living, was the substance of our discussion one month ago. It was shown that the assimilation of facts alone does not produce virtue. Parents and others too frequently neglect responsibility in the moral training of youth, and people, generally, are* too prone to deceive by substituting reputation for character. Honesty is the core of character, and it is Unfortunate that so many disintegrate at the core while they struggle desperately to maintain a gloss on the surface. Lesson aim. To show that greatness is dependent upon bigness of soul; that virtue in its highest sense requires the submergence of self to the welfare of others. IT has been said earlier that happiness is contingent upon love and service as well as upon personal health and progression. The application of truth to ourselves, and the devotion of ourselves to truth, are both prerequisite to real joy and the good life. But if we stop with ourselves alone, we stop far short of the goal, for man is a social being and, try as he may, man cannot become happy or great all by himself. As someone has said, \"Joy is a partnership, grief weeps alone.\" Happiness and selfishness are simply incompatible terms.\nMan has come a long way in his quest for knowledge and power applied to personal aggrandizement. It is time now that he learn how to love, give, and help for the benefit of others.\nThe Social Sense\nLove of neighbor is second only in importance on the scale of moral values to love of God and the principles of truth and righteousness he exemplified (See Matthew 22: 35-40). Not only is it impossible for man to be saved in ignorance, but it is impossible for him to be saved alone and in hate, as well. A sense of interest and responsibility in humanity about us, coupled with a willingness to consider ourselves secondary to the general welfare of all mankind, is essential to the highest good.\nJesus recognized this moral principle when he said, \"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it\" (Mark 8:34-35). When one selfishly or hatefully strives for self-benefit at the expense of others, he loses out on the better things of life, on satisfactions that can come only from self-denial, love, and service.\nBut this sense of social justice for world welfare is frequently never realized in the thinking and living of people. Covetousness, too, often crowds out generosity; vanity and egotism push aside humility and meekness; sympathy gives way to suspicion and slander; and love is outdone by hate. In their wild scramble for happiness, people too often center on themselves alone, and in so doing they lose the very thing that they seek.\nSmallness of character is a vice that feeds upon egotism and self-interest. Some people are small because they take themselves too seriously, they lack a sense of humor, they see themselves in distorted and inflated perspective. Others are small because they are unfriendly, inhospitable, inconsiderate; more concerned with personal advantage than with equality or justice, and straws willing to lie, steal, cheat, or hoard at the expense of the public. Still others are small because of the prejudices and hates they allow to operate. LESSON DEPARTMENT 125  Small people are parasites and leeches draining the life blood of humanity. Instead of contributing to society they take from it; instead of building it up they drag it down. Petty jealousy, malicious gossip, and trivial bickerings are characteristic of people like this? and the world is too full of their kind. Greatness is a quality of character derived from a sense of brotherhood, and its marks are those of sacrifice, charity, gratitude, loyalty, and the like. Gratitude in Place 01 Greed There is nothing that betrays the true character of a person any more than acts of ingratitude. Sometimes these acts grow out of selfish interests and the spirit of greed, and sometimes out of hate and the desire for revenge; but always in the unthankful heart there is an absence of love and social responsibility. The attitude of gratitude is one of the first steps in achieving greatness of soul. But we are at times prone to hide our feelings of friendliness and appreciation even when we have them, and that is bad. Why keep our hearts in cold storage? Expressions of gratitude and kindly acts toward those around us in appreciation for all they mean to us are small pay for the innumerable and continuous favors each receives from others. Furthermore, through such cheerfulness and helpfulness the soul of the giver is lifted up along with the souls of receivers, and in this way the world is made better and happier. We should speak a heartfelt thanks, write a letter of appreciation, perform an act of gratitude, whenever and wherever the opportunity permits. Every day should be a thanksgiving day. But gratitude to be helpful must be genuine. There is an unfortunate tendency in this modern day to standardize and commercialize sentimental expressions to the extent that they become artificial, superficial, and hollow. Too often we say things that others have composed, buy gifts that others have made, and give gifts out of habit or because we feel that we are expected to. Money interests through advertising have capitalized upon the sentiments of man until now Christmas, Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, birthdays, anniversaries, and other holidays have become festive occasions with great displays of gifts, but too little genuine appreciation springing from the soul. This is a perversion of sentiment and there is need for a return to the original, undiluted, and unpolluted. Gratitude is a virtue, but it requires neither the spending of money nor elaborate demonstration, and it is best when it is spontaneous, natural, and sincere. Tolerance Without Indifference Brotherhood implies the willingness and the ability to co-operate with others even when it is distasteful to do so. We don't need to tolerate wrong and evil, but we can be kindly and helpful to those who are in sin; we don't need to let go our convictions, but we can examine them in light of all the evidence, and we can suspend judgment until all the facts are known. Intolerance grows out of ignorance, falsehood, and prejudice; and it is unethical, unchristian, and un-American. But tolerance, of course, means neither indifference nor acceptance. Without conviction, tolerance may lead to instability and the perpetuation of wrong. On the other hand, though, conviction without tolerance may mean narrow dogmatism and blind bigotry. What we really need is a combination of the two; tolerance should be strengthened with conviction, and conviction should be open-minded and accompanied by mercy and charity for all. Unity does not require uniformity; we can have diversity and still work together co-operatively for the welfare of all humanity. If we can't agree, then we can agree good-naturedly to disagree, and go on living together in the spirit of tolerant participation. It is better that judgment be left to a power higher than mortal man. Failure to do this means intolerance, which often results in fundamental and far reaching injustice. Gossip is unkind; hate is vicious. It is our place to forgive; only God's place to judge. Tolerance is one of the most important and, yet, most lacking virtues in the scale of moral values. Benevolence Beyond Justice While brotherhood is based upon the concepts of equality and justice, it goes far beyond the bare requirements of these principles. It is born of the spirit of love, and leads to unselfishness, altruism, and generosity. It is not enough to be tolerant in a negative sense, we should be actively doing good in a positive sense; it is not enough to \"live and let live,\" we should live and help live. If man is -really impregnated with the spirit of brotherhood, his benevolence will reach far beyond retribution and justice alone; love and mercy will cause him to be generous beyond all specifications of law?and in this he will be really great. Nobility Through Sacrifice But the test of true greatness lies in one's willingness to deprive himself that others may benefit. Being tolerant of those around us, showing gratitude for their friendship and help, and even rendering service beyond bare requirements of justice, are all relatively easy where there is no particular sacrifice or inconvenience involved. It is through self-denial and sacrifice, however, that the greatest love is demonstrated and the greatest good accomplished. Nobility of character is a thing to be achieved through love, service, and sacrifice. The life of Christ furnishes an excellent example of nobility through sacrifice. He died that others might live, and in so doing he proved his greatness. Coming out of World War II, as has been true of all wars, are accounts of personal bravery and self-sacrifice beyond the call of duty. One of these accounts relates the experiences of a group of soldiers who had willingly and without complaint become \"expendable\" in the interests of their country.? Such unselfish heroism (and this is but one of a great many examples that could be cited) should make the hearts of everyone, regardless of country or creed, feel proud, for it demonstrates how noble and great man is capable of becoming. (See William L. White, They Were Expendable, New York City, Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1942). LESSON DEPARTMENT 127 The world is made better by such sacrifice. But the sad thing is that man so seldom rises above the petty, selfish, and commonplace activities of life. It is an unfortunate reflection upon humanity that it takes a war to make people really noble, and that, even then it is the battle front, not the home front, where true greatness is so often found. Why is there so much narrowness, cheapness, and smallness in the world today! Why are so many ignoble! Why are so few really great! Because selfishness, distrust, and hate are let loose, and world brotherhood remains largely an ideal not yet reached. If men are to be really great they must be willing to make themselves \"expendable,\" just as did Christ, and just as have many others in times of crisis. Consecration to an ideal; allegiance to a principle; loyalty to the right and to those who stand for the right; and, what is more, a willingness to sacrifice all, even life itself if necessary, for decency and justice?these things are important if man is to climb and if Christianity and civilization are to survive. Men should be more humble, teachable, and charitable; they should be less willing to misrepresent facts and exploit persons, and more willing to appreciate and accommodate others; they should have more brotherly love and be more noble in expressing it. When we sing \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men\" (Luke 2:14), let us remember that the glory of God is best realized through peace, and that peace can only come by the development of \"good will toward men.\" Brotherhood is a prerequisite to the greatest good in the universe and is therefore the key to greatness in personality. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Why are happiness and selfishness incompatible terms? Illustrate with examples. Why is it impossible for man to find either salvation or happiness all by himself? What did Jesus mean when he said that those who would try to save their lives would lose them, and vice versa? How does this apply to brotherhood? What do we mean by the \"social sense\"? Show how it is defeated by egotism; by selfishness; by prejudice and hate; by jealousy; by gossip; by petty bickering. Discuss each of these in turn, pointing out relationships to brotherhood and morality. What is a social parasite? 2. Why is ingratitude wrong? Is it necessary to speak words of appreciation when your actions already demonstrate that you are thankful? Which is the best expression of gratitude, words or actions? Show how gratitude expression is sometimes perverted. What do we mean by the commercialization of sentiment? Discuss. How can the expression of feelings on holidays and at other times be made more genuine and meaningful? Discuss. 3. Define tolerance. Does it require indifference on an issue or acceptance of another point of view? Give reasons for your answer. Define prejudice. What are the major reasons for the existence of prejudices and intolerance? Why. Should we suspend judgment of others and be anxious to forgive them of their mistakes. Does this condone sin? Is there a danger in being too forgiving? Discuss. 4. What is \"benevolence beyond justice\"? Why is the philosophy of \"live and help live\" of a higher order than \"live and let live\"? 5. What is nobility of character, and how is it achieved? Illustrate with the life and the teachings of Christ. What does it mean to be expendable? Was Christ expendable? Why is this a quality of greatness? Explain why there is so much cheapness and smallness in the world today. What is the result in society at large? In the character of people? Why is brotherhood the key to greatness? Selected References Milton Bennion, Moral Teachings of the New Testament, Deseret Book Co., 1928, pp. 36-38; 57-66; 95-118; 153-162. (Out of print) William L.

            "content": "EARLY SPRING RAIN\nOra Lee Parthesius\nThe sky is soft as a dove's gray wing, And through the silvered pattering Steals fragrance. Is it mignonette Or lilacs worn by some coquette? . . . Yes, winter's flirting with the spring! No Tongue Can Tell Marguerite J. Griffin \"OUT there we talk of death quite calmly,\" said a young sailor, home on leave after seeing action in the South Pacific. \"We talk over what has happened to this one and that one of our friends. We never spare the details. We talk of death quite as matter-of-factly, as if we were discussing a newspaper item. We might as well. It's all around us out there, and we know it. I've seen more things than I can tell you.\"\nHe was much changed, this young man, from what he had been when he had gone away. Two years older? Yes, but more than that. His ordinarily fair-skinned face was bronzed from the rigors of sea life. But there were shadows across his brow, faint ones easily removed by his ready smile, but still lurking there in moments of repose. There was a firm new purpose to his jaw, as though, whatever his naval rank, he was master of himself no matter what the days might bring. And all this change because he had seen more things than tongue can tell. Physical suffering he had seen because he served with the medical corps. Death he had seen. Men dying before his very eyes. Men dying without a whimper, without a complaint.\n\"After one bombing we went about on deck helping the wounded. They were lying all about. I saw a fellow who had been my best friend lying over his gun. I thought he was dead, but when I came up to him he recognized me and he said: 'Do not move me for the others are\nabout done for.' But I had to do something for him. He was my friend. He died an instant later in my arms, and then I was glad, seeing his condition. This is something I will never forget as long as I live. Yes. Death is something we talk about quite openly. It's there and you have to face it.\"\nThat was the thing that made this boy different from what he had been before. He had been face to face with death. He knew he would go back to face it again, but in the meantime he would serve as best he could and smile all the while. While life lasted there were things to do for the living and last respects to the dead. Time enough to worry about danger when it struck. Two years ago he had been a young, care-free boy. Today he is a man, brave, master of himself and his emotions. And what has wrought the change? One thing. His ability to face reality, look it squarely in the eye, and spend his strength getting the most possible joy out of the real things of life, people, places, and comradeship.\nWhat are you doing, mothers of these boys who have become men overnight, who have seen more things than tongue can tell? What are you doing to change your own souls that would like to cringe and shrink into citadels strong and sure? What am I doing to prepare myself against the day when my sons must go forth to face the pains of life and death upon their own? How do we mean to face the problems of our own\nlives courageously? We believe we could endure the dangers our sons face more easily than to know that they, in whose veins flow our own blood, must suffer, endure, and perchance die. But if our task is great, we must be greater.\nI have seen mothers become whimpering old women, old long before their time, after their sons had sailed away to front-line action. I have seen them become helpless neurotics who can't stand to hear a news broadcast, who can't bear to read a paper. If it were helping these boys, then it would have purpose. But worry, anxiety cannot reach out and stop the bombs from falling. Instead, they twine like tentacles about the one who conceived them, crushing from her all the breath of life, like an octopus with its overpowering grip.\nAgain I have seen mothers, with heads erect, lock their secret heartaches into a dark corner of their beings, and valiantly go forth to take their parts in the many duties of life at home. Why the difference? Why does one cringe and one remain indomitable. The reason is simple, depending upon whether you fight with life or against it, whether you look the whole thing squarely in the face like the young seaman. It is whether you, too, know that death is there and will admit it, or whether you are trying to avoid it, to fight your own small futile fight, you know. Since Adam, men who have lived upon this earth have died. In that one thing all humanity are brothers. You know that each man must die, but don't push the knowledge back into a far corner of your heart and refuse to face it. Well, bring it out into the\nlight and let the sun shine upon it for awhile. You are going to die. Your son is going to die. No matter how you live, or grieve, or worry, you cannot change this fact. War doesn't make much difference then. It only makes you more aware that death stalks the earth.\nBUT you say: \"My boy is so young! What a pity a life is cut short in youth!\" So we always feel. A pity to die so young! But what does it matter if life be long or short? The important thing is, how have we lived and how have we died. The day to an honest man, busy with his constructive work, may seem all too short. The same day to a criminal waiting to pay for his crime upon the gallows may seem a fortunate eternity. But the day had twenty-four hours, and if it rained it rained for both. The difference is only in the human heart, in the way of life. One man knows the peace of honesty, the other the remorse, the despondency of a life which must pay for wasted deeds. Who, then, can measure a life, if it be long or short? Better to say it was rich or poor. Rich in valiance, in love, in honor, or poor in fear, in selfishness, in smallness of spirit. True it is, today many a youth gives his life, brief in years, but full of valor. \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"\n\"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.\" A strange thing? It has happened over and over in this world, but there has appeared with it the strange. It is something we have never felt before. It is a thrust to our courage. But we are not alone. Dogs that help? Every soul who has lived has had to face his Gethsemane, even the Son of Man. \"Forasmuch as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin.\"\nAs human beings we must suffer some things over which we have no control, sickness, financial reverses, death, but at least if we seek an honorable way to life we can spare ourselves many heartaches of our own making.\nThere are so many things to benefit humanity that need to be done. Your sons are doing a big part of them. There is much remaining for us to do at home. There will always be a need for worthwhile tasks, well done.\n\"And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\" And what person is it we should fear? None other than our own selves. True we must answer the call of death, for that is an event of life through which all must pass, but how we die and how we live\nthat is our own affair. We can chart a course which will steer us safely through troubled waters or we can let our souls crack up in the storm. It is for us to choose.\n\"And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.\" Hear the words of the Son of God who gave his life upon the cross to break the bonds of death, that the sea might one day give up the dead that are in it, that he might say unto the dry, parched, shattered bones of war, \"Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.\" The same Lord who said: \"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\"\nAs he leads let us follow, and while our days endure in the world we, too, can overcome the trials that beset our days, we can take up our cross and follow him. We can feel his peace which is so sweet no tongue can tell. THE SNOWBALLS Olive Rose Helton A bit of gleaming white, A breath of sweet perfume, A tiny snow-white bud, And then a large full bloom. Now sparkling in the sunlight, Now shadowed by the trees; No lovelier flower in springtime, Than snowballs in the breeze. Work Meeting UTILITY APRONS IN most present-day households the homemaker finds it necessary not only to do her own housework, but to learn how to conserve her energy so she can accomplish all the tasks she desires to do. These aprons are practical in any kind of household but they are invaluable in homes where there are busy mothers and small children. The large pockets become convenient \"catch-alls\" for numerous articles which become misplaced. If the pockets are lined with oiled silk or a plasticized material they can also be used to carry a damp cloth for wiping off stray fingermarks, a cloth for furniture polishing, a whisk broom, etc. Such utility articles might be made on a Relief Society Work Meeting in the spring or for a coming bazaar. The apron (Illus. I) is very easily made using 3/5 yd. Of material 27\" wide for the apron proper, and 8\" of contrasting material for the pockets. The apron is most effective using a light color for the background and a very dark color for the pockets. The apron (Illus. 2) can be made in medium size using 21/8 yds. Of 35\" material.

MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS (Continued from February Magazine) East Central States Mission THE following reports from four of the branches of this mission were received during 1944. Their Mission Relief Society President, Leone W. Doxey, submitted all but one. \"In the country district of Gretna, Virginia,\" wrote Sister Doxey, \"we have a Relief Society with sixteen members, thirteen of whom are not members of the Church. \"The meetings of tlie Gretna Relief Society are held Tuesday afternoons in the home of Sister Maria Rowland, 'Granny,' as she is lovingly called by all who know her. The home is a fine old Virginia farmhouse that had been the home of her husband's father and mother. Granny moved into it as a bride. She is now nearly eighty years old and has been a member of the Church for more than forty years. She teaches the theology lessons in Relief Society and is an inspiration to everyone there.\" Mrs. L. H. Snow, president of the Chadottesville (Virginia) Relief Society, wrote July 20, 1944: \"In and around this city and also other big towns, we see many beautiful little country churches closed for lack of preachers. Women from Page 184 some of these churches are joining the Relief Society and are glad to get something to do. I wish you could see our women working, making rugs, quilts, et cetera. The people in the country want to piece quilts so Iam taking them the material. I am also taking them samples of a miniature redchecked apron and a tiny pair of blue and white striped overalls, to help in the collection of contributions to the building fund. A note in the apron pocket has space for filling in the woman's name and her waist measurement, and carries the suggestion, \"A penny for every inch.\" A similar note in the overall pocket suggests that the men pledge either work on the chapel or a cash donation. We also have one member in Hampton, and she is making something for the bazaar in October. Some members up in the Blue Ridge near Standardsville are making quilts?one woman gave the top, filling, and bottom for a quilt last night. This project is getting every one doing something, and in that way they learn what we stand for and what we are doing in trying to teach the gospel. The people are hungry for the gospel and for friends.\" Sister Doxey reports an unusual Relief Society meeting held at Fairmont, Virginia, which came to her attention through Sister Crozier Kimball, a short-term missionary. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 185 RELIEF SOCIETY OF HARKERS ISLAND (NORTH CAROLINA), EAST CENTRAL STATES MISSION Picture submitted March 1944 by M. LA. President Raymond Guthrie who stated: This Society was organized in 1923 under adverse circumstances and almost unbearable persecution. Although at that time the membership was very small it has since grown, through the faith and charity exercised by the sisters, to the present membership of 30. Left to right, front row: Virgie Lewis, Annie B. Guthrie, Annie Rose, Annie Lee Lawrence, Edith Willis (Secretary), Gertie Willis (1st Counselor), Letha Lewis (President), Blanch Willis (2d Counselor), Lillian Davis (teacher), Belva Gillikin, Mamie Hamilton, Clara Willis and Edith A. Willis; second row: Nettie Brooks, Naomi Guthrie, Flora Belle Willis, Hannah Guthrie; third row: Glennie Guthrie, Mattie Whitley, Bessie Hancock, Nannie Willis and Hattie Rose. \"Sister May Sloter, Relief Society president in Fairmont, had announced on Sunday that the work meeting would be held the following Wednesday afternoon. The time arrived for the appointed meeting and no one came but the president. She felt discouraged and somewhat upset, but she had said there would be Relief Society meeting so she conducted one. She announced the song and sang it, opened the meeting with prayer, sang again and then sat down and quilted for an hour. At the end of the hour she sang another song and dismissed the meeting with prayer. She put her work away and returned to her home with joy and satisfaction in her heart. Sister Sloter is loved and respected by the members of the Fairmont Branch and though the membership is small, after this example of faithfulness, all who possibly can now attend the meetings.\" Northern California Mission MARY SMITH ELLSWORTH, recently released president of Relief Societies of the Northern California Mission, wrote last June: \"During the year thus far I have visited in every district with President Ellsworth. The most outstanding thing I find is the increased spirit of unity and cooperation and love among all our sisters. Our Relief Society meetings are held in most branches immediately following Sunday School; while the men Attend Priesthood meeting, the Relief Society and Primary convene. RELIEF SOCIETY MEMBERS.

Transportation facilities are more available on Sunday, especially in our outlying districts and where many of our people are engaged in war work. \"It is the earnest desire of President Ellsworth to establish a suitable place of meeting for every branch in this mission, and in this the sisters are doing their full part. This year two chapels have been dedicated and property has been purchased in eight branches. The sisters have given dinners not only for their own members, but, in several instances, have served for various clubs and groups who have paid them well. They have held rummage sales to dispose of clothes collected from neighbors and friends as well as our own members. Prior to the sales, these articles are washed or cleaned and mended; they bring in a very good price and help those who need them. High-type character balls and parties which included wholesome and amusing games have placed the sisters in touch with many, thus affording opportunity to teach the gospel by example as well as precept. \"We have in the mission, now, 260 local missionaries, many of them our Relief Society sisters. We feel thankful for this, for our younger mothers are gaining experience and knowledge that will qualify them to teach their children the gospel. We appreciate the excellent lessons given us by the General Board. They breathe the pure spirit of the gospel, impel us to action, and help to qualify us for real missionary work.\" Anna Duckett, secretary-treasurer of the Toyon (Redding, California) Branch Relief Society submitted last July the accompanying pictures and the following article by Eva S. Richards, a member: They Are Still Pioneers NOTES FROM THE FIELD 187 RELIEF SOCIETY SINGING MOTHERS OF SAVANNAH BRANCH (GEORGIA), SOUTHERN STATES MISSION Mission Relief Society President Effie Meeks says this is a splendid singing group which is a factor in maintaining interest in Relief Society work there. \"In the shadow of snow-capped Mt. Shasta lies a minute branch of the Church?the Toyon Branch. It is situated on the hills and bluffs overlooking the Sacramento River and Shasta Dam, the world's second largest concrete structure. \"The construction of this dam has brought people from all over the world, both as workers and visitors, and so the Toyon Branch is very cosmopolitan with representation from Canada, Australia, Germany, England, Sweden, Holland, as well as most of the states, from coast to coast. \"The dam is fifteen miles from the nearest California town of any size, and its construction brought five or six thousand persons, some of them Mormons, into a wilderness of red clay, turpentine pines, manzanita, and poison oak. \"Some of those who came early in the construction period spent that first miserable winter (three months of constant rain) in canvas tents; but spring comes early in this part of California and by April 1938, homes were started. Poison oak brush was plentiful and had to be cleared; even smoke from its burning carried contamination. Most of the work of clearing was done by women and children, for the work shifts on the dam changed every two weeks for some, while others worked a constant shift of day, swing or graveyard. \"The homes usually had their beginning as one-room affairs, but as the men earned steadily, the homes grew. Wells were dug in very unpromising terrain, with accidents, and even casualties, a common occurrence. MEMBERS OF THE NEWLY ORGANIZED RELIEF SOCIETY AT PLYMOUTH. MASSACHUSETTS standing in front of the National Monument to the Forefathers which overlooks the bay. Left to right: Kate Burgesis, Marjorie Pickett, Elder Harold Dance, Estella Hutchins, and Elizabeth Pickett, Relief Society president. The other members unable to be present when picture was taken are Cora E. Bartlett and Cora Ann Glass. Delightful homes with electricity and modern conveniences are seen in the once-wilderness. And now, six years later, \"The women worked long and hard to build these homes even though they knew they were to live there but a few years. Some of the women were sickly, some were old, some were having children, but they all had the desire for a home of their own. One family took the red clay, formed it into bricks, and, in one year, built for themselves a spacious six-room home that is now one of the social centers of the branch. \"Gardens were made in the red clay by the women and children who carried fertilizer and sand from the river banks. Much to everyone's amazement, the gardens produced. The daughters of the pioneers are still helping to make a garden spot in the West, and are seeing that their children are raised in the culture of home and Church. \"The Toyon Branch covers ten square miles. All of the visiting teachers are women who have families of small children, but their work has been done efficiently and on time. The loid anniversary of the organization of the Relief Society was observed March 17 by the Toyon Branch? Crystal candles, wild ferns, redbud and forsythia decorated the community house and an unforgettable program was presented. The war and the closing scenes at Shasta Dam are now sending this group on again to new fields, to new homes. They will carry their spirit of love and endeavor into new communities that have never heard of Mormons or witnessed their industry. \"Good luck to you all and Godspeed?modern pioneer women.\" New England Mission ELDER FOLEY C. RICHARDS was auxiliary supervisor for the mission at the time he submitted the following account, last August: \"Again the Relief Society plays the pioneer role in New England, this time in the 'Pilgrim Town,' Plymouth, Massachusetts, where America's forefathers settled three hundred and twenty-four years ago. \"On May 23, 1944, a Relief Society was organized there?the first organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be established in Plymouth. Under the direction of President William H. Reeder, Jr., Bertha S. Reeder, mission Relief Society president, and Elder Ted L. Miller, district president, this Society was organized with six members. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 189 FOUR RELIEF SOCIETIES OF THE WESTERN STATES MISSION (Pictures submitted by Luceal R. Curtis, recently released president of the Relief Societies of this mission.) Top row, left to right: Relief Society at Salida, Colorado; Relief Society at Fruita, Colorado, observes the 102d anniversary. Bottom row, left to right: Belle Fourche (South Dakota) Branch also celebrates 102d anniversary of Relief Society; Relief Society at Grand Junction, Colorado. Three of these were Latter-day Saints at the time; one has subsequently been baptized, and the other two are earnest investigators of the gospel. All are the fruits of recent missionary labor. 'These good sisters are enthusiastically meeting together each week, and the future of their group is promising indeed. Each has had to face the usual criticism which attends one who is willing to subscribe to 'Mormon' beliefs, and the Church can be justly proud of them for their Pilgrim spirit of loyalty to their convictions and for their service which makes possible this Latter-day Saint organization in New England's oldest town.\" Lola Humphreys, writing in the fall of 1944 as auxiliary supervisor, reported the successful Relief Society convention held September 2', at Cambridge, Massachusetts (the mission headquarters) for Relief Society officers. She continues: 'The careful planning which took place several weeks in advance, contributed greatly to the success of the conference which was very well attended by approximately 75 Relief Society officers. \"During the forenoon session, a detailed and instructive outline of the duties of the officers was given by Mission Relief Society President Bertha S. Reeder. The remaining time was spent in the bearing of testimonies. At noon, a delicious buffet luncheon was served in one of the rooms of the Cambridge chapel from a table very attractively arranged with candles and flowers. In the afternoon, several talks were given in the homes of different Relief Society branches, and the Singing Mothers of Hartford, Connecticut, offered three beautiful numbers, at intervals.\n\"The enthusiasm and zeal with which Sister Reeder discussed the problems and with which she delivered her remarks were transferred to every one present. In spite of the fact that some of the members had had travel much more capable of carrying home the day before, they all felt much more capable of carrying on their duties after the convention.\"\nA comprehensive mimeographed bulletin was distributed, carrying a concise and explicit digest of duties of officers and of new instructions, and also a narrative history of the several local Relief Societies in the mission for 1943-44, indicating the problems, activities, and accomplishments of each.\nHawaiian Mission\nOLIVIA S. Waddoups, former Relief Society president of this mission, wrote in March 1944: \"Brother Waddoups is superintendent of the Leper-asylum here at Kalaupapa. We find a wide field for service to these people who, though entirely confined for life within this area of about 12 square miles, are very happy, cheerful, and contented. They are also very war conscious, buying bonds and stamps to the extent of three times their quota. They are well taken care of by the Territory. We have a very modern hospital, two capable doctors whose wives are nurses in the hospital, five other nurses; 12 Catholic Sisters who manage the hospital, five other nuns; two Catholic priests; one Congregational minister, his wife and three members of his family; the plantation manager and planter; and the general manager for the United States Public Health Service; the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church; four Brothers who are in charge of the Leper Home for Men; the Catholic, with Reverend Alice, a real Hawaiian lady, to look after her congregation; and our L.D.S. Church. The Elders visit us monthly, and we have a patient here who is the Presiding Elder. We have the smallest congregation but our members are very active and interested.\n\"The Relief Society sisters who are well enough to get out are very active. Last Sunday we held an anniversary meeting commemorating March 17. We all came dressed in white; there were 9 of us, and 12 young girls and 16 of the Priesthood. I am sure this was the most unique anniversary meeting in the Church. All but two of us are victims of the disease?myself and Sister Kalahau, a very little one, but we try to keep who is blind but who leads the group in their singing. In the group that furnished the singing there were four blind, two on crutches, and others who needed help to get around. But they sang beautifully, and bore testimony that the Lord was good, and kind, and that they were very grateful for the Relief Society organization.\n\"All in all, we have a little world, a very little one, but we try to keep happy, busy and helpful. We take every precaution possible. We have several people here who have been here over 40 and one 53 years, working with the patients in every way, in the hospital, dressing their wounds, bathing them, and giving (Continued on page 192) The Shape of Peace Eva Willes Wangsgaard I God of all men and nations, Light in Light, I, who am spent with fear and sorrowing, Ask for a ray to follow through this night Darkened by earthen gods to which men cling.

            "content": "The Relief Society In Church Welfare Elder Marion G. Romney Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles and Assistant Managing Director General Church Welfare Committee \n\n\"FROM the beginning, the women of the Christian Church have shown their surpassing faith and devotion. Only one apostle stood near the Cross while the Christ was crucified, but Mary, the mother, was there, and Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children, and the women that followed Him from Galilee. It was Mary Magdalene who was first at the tomb when the Sabbath had ended, and to her Christ vouchsafed the first view to mortals of His resurrected body.\n\"From that time until now woman has comforted and nursed the Church. She has borne more than half the burdens, she has made more than half the sacrifices, she has suffered most of the heartaches and sorrows.\n\"In the modern Church hers has been the abiding, unquestioning faith, the pure knowledge that has enheartened the Priesthood and kept it going forward against all odds. Her loving trust, her loyal devotion were the faithful anchor that held when storms were fiercest.\" (President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Annual Conference Report, April 1940, p. 21.)\nThe \"women of the Christian Church\" include the sisters of the Relief Society, and to no group does this sublime tribute more aptly apply.\nOne hundred and three years ago, the Prophet \"assisted in commencing the organization of the Society.\" In illustrating its objects, he said that the \"sisters might provoke the brethren to good works, in looking to the wants of the poor, searching after objects of charity, and in administering to their wants,\" (Relief Society Handbook, pp. 21-22). And later in the same month he wrote that its \"object is the relief of the poor, the destitute, the widow and the orphan, and for the exercise of all benevolent purposes.\" He was assured \"that with the resources they will have at command, they will fly to the relief of the stranger; they will pour in oil and wine to the wounded heart of the distressed; they will dry up the tears of the orphan and make the widow's heart to rejoice.\" (D.H.C. Vol. IV, p. 567.)\nTo guide them in this work, the sisters were to \"receive instructions through the order of the Priesthood which God has established, through the medium of those appointed to lead, guide and direct the affairs of the Church in this last dispensation.\" (D.H.C. Vol. IV, p. 567.)\nThat the bishop is included in this \"order of the Priesthood\" is clear from the fact that before the Relief\n\nSociety was organized, the Lord had given instructions for the care of the poor of his Church in the revelations received by the Prophet. In these revelations all the powers, functions, and responsibilities necessary for caring for the poor were given to the bishop.\n\"The Prophet expressed the view that for the sisters to assist in administering to the wants of the poor was one of the best means to the saving of souls, which was the ultimate aim of the Society.\n\"The century-old record of love-inspired service by the Relief Society is an enduring tribute to its members. Surely the Prophet spoke with prophetic accuracy when he said: 'I now turn the key in your behalf in the name of the Lord, and this Society shall rejoice, and knowledge and intelligence shall flow down from this time henceforth; this is the beginning of better days to the poor and needy, who shall be made to rejoice and pour forth blessings on your heads.\" (D.H.C., Vol. IV, p. 607) Since March of 1842, in every place where members of the Church have gone, and in all circumstances, the hallowed influence of these women has been actively present. Into countless homes they have gone to take food when hunger threatened; to take clothing and fuel to protect from cold; to nurse in time of illness; to prepare the dead for burial; and to comfort the aching heart. Neither the number of services engaged in nor the amount of time given in them can be set down, for no record has or could have been kept.\n\"Until recently, the Relief Society visiting teachers in making their monthly visits have gathered charity funds from which aid supplemental to that rendered by the bishop has been administered. In this activity the sisters have rendered a worthy service, resulting in much good and often sorely needed, for in some places there has been little searching after or administering to the poor other than what the Relief Society women have done.\n\"Under the impetus of the Church Welfare Plan, however, the bishops are more fully discharging the part of their bishop's calling. Into their hands is coming the production of the annual Church Welfare budget, as also increased funds from fast offerings. The Relief Society sisters are therefore relieved from the necessity of maintaining a separate charity account, but their duties toward helping the poor have increased in other ways. This is as it should be, for the Bishop and"

            "content": "the Relief Society president have been described as the father and the mother of the ward, and in all well-organized families the father is the provider.\n\"With the development of the Church Welfare Plan the Relief Society's sphere of activity in welfare work has, as stated, been extended, however, and not restricted. Relieved of the necessity for maintaining and administering an independent charity fund, the sisters are more fully devoting their time to caring for the members of the ward family. They are extending such services as caring for the sick (within the past eighteen months in a rather large city on the fringe of the Church my wife and I were confined to our hotel with illness; one person only sought us out to render aid; it was the Relief Society president); comforting the distressed and sorrowing; training the teachable to sew and cook, as also other arts of home-making; adroitly showing mothers and other homemakers how to get the most out of the means at their disposal. THE RELIEF SOCIETY IN CHURCH WELFARE 133 Thus ministering among the people with sympathetic understanding, they are winning and sacredly guarding the confidence of ward members; advising, the bishop in private, as a wise mother does her husband, of the circumstances and needs of each family and ward member; and then administering in the homes, from the substance supplied by the bishops from fast offerings and bishops' storehouses, the assistance determined upon by the bishop in consultation with the Relief Society president. Sometimes with consummate skill they properly \"provoke the brethren (the bishops) to good works, in looking to the wants of the poor, searching after objects of charity, and in administering to their wants,\" as the Prophet Joseph said they might. Much of the foregoing work and ministration is of a confidential nature requiring special skill, and is therefore to be done under the immediate supervision of the bishop and the Relief Society president. THERE is another field of activity, however, in which every member of the Society may and most of them do participate. It is in the production of the Welfare budget. Annually, each ward undertakes to produce, in so far as it may, commodities food, clothing, and fuel  which may be needed during the coming season by members of the ward who will not be able to care for themselves. Certain surpluses to be made available to other wards are likewise produced. From the total of these surpluses, all bishops in the Church may obtain needed commodities which cannot be produced in their own localities. This is the annual Welfare budget. What the ward undertakes to produce is determined by the bishop and the ward Relief Society president, in consultation with the stake welfare committee. The budget, therefore, reaches the ward through the welfare organization from the General Church Welfare Committee, and members of the General Relief So-city Presidency are advisers to that Board. The production of the budget is a ward responsibility under the leadership of the bishop and his ward welfare committee, of which the ward Relief Society president and work director are members. In too many instances the raising of the finances for the clothing budget is improperly left to the Relief Society. This is a ward responsibility, and should be arranged for by the ward welfare committee as a whole, under the leadership of the bishop. The Relief Society should not be asked to bear this whole burden. An objective of Church Welfare is to afford opportunities for those who need or may need the commodities to produce them, in so far as they may and will. But the fact remains that the production of such items as bedding, clothing, kitchen and bathroom linen, as also the processing of meats, fruits, and vegetables, is assigned to and in large measure accomplished by the Relief Society sisters. This is a tremendous undertaking, far and away greater than could be accomplished out of the funds formerly collected by the Relief Society, and carrying succor and relief to many more needy than the funds formerly collected could provide for. The following figures will suggest the increased activity for helping the poor which has come to the Relief Society sisters participating in this service, and will suggest also the amount of that service and the numbers joining therein. Reports reveal that in 1943 alone  1944 statistics are not yet available  the Relief Society sisters made through their sewing services nearly a quarter million (244,636) articles, and that nearly three quarter million (709,494) hours were given to this service; 32,892 women per month participated; 23,114 of these articles were quilts of high quality and utility value. Not all of these items were for the Church Welfare budget, but a substantial part of them were. Canned for the bishops storehouse program, in 1943, were 1,300,000 cans of vegetables, fruits, jams, and spreads, and 33,800 cans of meat, fish, and fowl. Most of the work involved in this processing was done by members of the Relief Society. We doubt if any other women's philanthropic organization in the world can parallel this remarkable record. Sisters of the Relief Society, your unbroken record of loyal service to the objects set before you by the Prophet of the new dispensation deserves the approval of heaven and the plaudits of men. It is gratifying to know that, at the beginning of your second century, you are continuing with all the good works of the past, and that you are, at the same time, moving in to wider fields of service with renewed faith and vigor. May the Lord grant that, ministering under the power of his spirit, you may so serve the distressed of this and future generations that they may have added cause \"to rejoice and pour forth blessings on your heads.\""

Maw Governor of the State of Utah Prepared by Governor Maw at the request of the Church Beautification Committee. THE State of Utah is definitely and officially in favor of a state-sponsored celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the arrival in Salt Lake Valley of the Utah pioneers. The Utah Statutes provide that \"the exposition provided in connection with the centennial observance shall be officially opened on May 1, 1947, and continue to October 15, 1947.\" This law was passed in 1939. It followed the recommendations of a committee authorized by a joint resolution adopted by the Legislature in 1937. The Act states that its purpose is \"to commemorate the advent of the pioneers into Salt Lake Valley, to portray fittingly the natural resources and scenic wonders of Utah, the prehistoric culture of the west, the development of irrigation, farming, mining, forestry, transportation, culture and the arts.\" The law authorizes a Centennial Commission of fifteen members, selected \"without regard to political or other affiliations\" who serve without compensation, to be confirmed by the State Senate and to hold office as members of a body corporate for ten years, thus continuing until the completion of the celebration and exposition, and the winding up of its affairs. The members include President David O. McKay, of Salt Lake City, as chairman; Former Governor Charles R. Mabey, J. F. Fitzpatrick, S. O. Bennion, David H. Thomas, John M. Wallace, D. M. Draper, Gus P. Backman, Donald P. Lloyd, and Postmaster L A. Smoot, all of Salt Lake City; Mrs. Rosella F. Larkin and J. A. Howell, of Ogden; F. P. Champ, of Logan; A. O. Ellett, at that time a Provo resident; and Senator Ward C. Holbrook, of Bountiful. The late Nephi L. Morris, of Salt Lake City, was a member of the Commission at the time of his death. The Commission was instructed by the Act creating it to \"plan and arrange for a fitting centennial observance in the year 1947, with appropriate provision being made therefor in such communities and at such scenic, historical, cultural and recreational centers of attraction from Yellowstone Park on the north to Boulder Dam on the south and from the Salt Flats on the west to the Dinosaur Quarries on the east, as the Commission may designate, and to hold and maintain an exposition on some appropriate site to be selected by it.\" Page  The Centennial Commission has wide authority to proceed as its considered judgment may direct. In retrospect, this project for a new kind of World's Fair one in which the main attractions were to be some of the world's greatest wonders and some of its most attractive scenery \"in place\" must appear a bold one, and worthy of the sturdy independence of the pioneers who came to this desert region a century ago and here developed a new form of western culture based on irrigation, the range, and the mine. Such plans were all the more remarkable because, at the time they were forming, this State and the world at large were steeped in the most severe and most widely spread economic depression in history. Many citizens were pinching their last few pennies. Schools and other public institutions were getting along on pittances far below their needs. At such a time, it required both courage and leadership on the part of men of vision to rally support for an undertaking which would require large expenditures, one from which the returns, though perhaps certain, would be largely intangible. Then war intervened. A far-seeing National Government inaugurated an emergency defense program in 1939 and 1940. After December 7, 1941, this country was plunged into the most destructive struggle in all history. Wartime needs would not be denied. Men and women were summoned to battle. Vast projects were initiated. Labor shortages became acute. Rigid priorities were established. Today, Utah boys and girls are fighting and dying on the battle-fronts of the world to preserve that way of life for which their pioneer ancestors gave their all. We cannot and we must not let them down. Is all, then, lost? Has everything been sacrificed on Mars' bloody altar? Must we entirely forego the duty we owe to the founders of this commonwealth, to honor their courage and their self-sacrifice, to pay fitting tribute to their daring and resourcefulness? Is there no way in which we can renew the ideals for which they lived and died? Those ideals have made this State and the Intermountain Region great. They have stirred the hearts of men to battle for freedom and to love their fellow man. The men and women Utah desires to honor were not in the habit of giving up their plans because difficulties confronted. Their sons and daughters and those who followed the pioneers into this land will profit by their example, will display the same independence and leadership. Utahns will not permit the murk of war to blot out the centennial of the State's founding. Wartime conditions may restrict the extent of the celebration. They cannot obliterate the memory of the Utah pioneers, nor can they quench the ardor and enthusiasm of the celebrants. WHAT sort of celebration shall be attempted if the war with Germany and Japan is still being desperately waged in 1947? Are we prepared with an adequate program if world peace has come by that time? Or if either of the remaining Axis foes is still on his feet? The answer to these queries becomes fairly obvious. Such observance of the centennial is always possible Torius Knaphus THE HANDCART as will not require great expenditures of manpower suitable for military service or war industry work. In the meantime, plans must be formulated blueprints drawn, if you like ready to be put into action the minute manpower and materials become available should hostilities cease or slacken. It would seem basic, for example, that, in order to celebrate properly, the State must take on a holiday attire. This is something in which each resident can join. There is nothing in war's demands that requires broken down fences, filthy corrals, dilapidated outbuildings or unpainted homes. Rather do neatness and order go hand-in-hand with efficient, productive labor, and that is one of the essentials of the war effort. Let Utah, then, dress up in honor of her pioneer founders. That much groundwork for an adequate celebration certainly is possible. Other forms of observance which require little or no extra drain on the State's manpower can be encouraged. An art exhibition, an Easter pageant, a State or County Fair, any activity which has become a customary and periodic outlet for community effort can tell the story of a century during which civilization and the modern way of life were established on the unpromising and hostile desert. Let the management and sponsors of all such community events redouble their efforts to make the 1947 version far excel all its predecessors. It will prove an eloquent tribute to the greatness of the enterprise the Utah pioneers instituted. These are but suggestions for a beginning of the groundwork of the centennial program. Other and more definite features will be worked out as circumstances permit. The main idea is that this great historic occasion can and must be fittingly commemorated. The spirit of the pioneers of western irrigation is not dead. That same indomitable courage and ingenuity which enabled them to direct the harsh natural forces to man s benefit will encourage us their sons and daughters, to pay adequate tribute to our forefathers  accomplishments. THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAY 1 begin by saying that the Relief Society of the Church is far and away the greatest woman's organization in the world. It is great not alone in its aims and purposes, which are to alleviate the want, misery, and suffering of humanity; not alone in its almost earth-wide reach, for it covers the bulk of the Christian world; not alone in the achievements of its activities, though it has brought to the needy, living where it worked, food, clothing, shelter, fuel; not though it has nursed those who were sick, buried the dead of the poor, comforted those who were downhearted; not though it has sustained those who were weak in spirit, built up righteousness in the hearts of the wayward, and brought the living truth into the homes of all who give it an abiding place, to their salvation and final exaltation,  the Relief Society is greatest, not alone because of all these, but because its directing head and the great bulk of all those who make up its membership share as of right in the blessings and promises of the priesthood borne by their husbands the Holy Priesthood of God; greatest because its leaders and members have the right to the inspiration of the Lord in the carrying on of their work; greatest because in their work of now almost a century they have been richly endowed by that inspiration, they have been constantly directed by the Spirit of the Lord which has never departed from them since the Prophet brought a few (18) of the sisters together and set them about their work. These, Sisters, have been your sacred opportunities, and your glorious, Christ-like achievements. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Relief Society Conference Address, \"Our Homes,\" October 3, 1940. If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain; If I can ease one life the aching. Or cool one pain. Or help one fainting robin Unto its nest again, I shall not live in vain.

            "content": "Easter and the Second Coming of the Lord Elder Leo J. Muir Former President Los Angeles Stake And Former President Northern States Mission (Chicago) AS thoughtful and devout Christians celebrate the coming Easter season, their minds and hearts are likely to be beckoned forward to the coming of the Master, rather than backward to his resurrection. Christ's triumphant arising from the tomb is being overshadowed by the nearness of his second coming to the earth. The early future promises to realize for mankind the prophetic salutation: \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.\"\nHere indeed is heaven's supreme salutatory to mortal man. This proclamation has provoked more discussion and speculation than any other word or prophecy. The unbeliever has jested about it and ridiculed it. Many people have predicted the immediate fulfillment all down the generations of time. The devout have fearfully and reverently invoked God's day for its fulfillment.\nThe signs of the times point to the early coming of this glorious spectacle the coming to earth of the Lord Jesus Christ in the clouds of heaven. That we might contemplate this auspicious occasion in its full significance let us review briefly the scenes in the great drama which closed with this marvelous prophecy. The events of the Passion Week are punctuated by a few sentences which stand out in bold relief against the dismal background of shame and sorrow.\nOut of the peaceful, yet disturbing, ceremony of the Last Supper came the immortal injunction: \"This do ye in remembrance of me.\" From the shadowed precincts and the deep anguish of Gethsemane came the grief-laden prayer of the Master: \"O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\"\n\"And they crucified him\" is the laconic account of the cruel and gruesome tragedy of Golgotha. These colorless words a conjunction, two pronouns, and a verb record the fact of the execution of the Son of God, who died that death may be no more. On death's own battlefield, Christ the Lord destroys death for the children of men.\n\"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\" was the accusation written in three languages: the Hebrew, the Greek, and the Latin. The first of these is the tongue through which God had revealed his will to his prophets; the second is the language of culture and the learning of that day; and the third, the language\nPage 139 of the conquering race which then held the Holy Land under subjection. This superscription, thus written, heralded to all people the alleged reason for the conviction and crucifixion of the Christ. The \"Chief Priest of the Jews\" protested that the accusation was not right: that it should indicate that Christ had said he was King of the Jews. Pilate stubbornly refused to alter the superscription and there it stood. It must have pleased the heart of Jesus to know that his true status as King of the Jews was so boldly proclaimed.\n\"Truly this was the Son of God\" was the emphatic verdict of the Roman centurion who had, as an officer on guard, observed the stupid and brutal performance.\n\"He is risen\" came as the calm and solemn assurance of the angel who answered the excited inquiry of \"Mary Magdalene and the other Mary.\" Though calmly spoken, and to these two women alone, these angelic words reflect the triumphant climax in this eternal drama. And what triumph it was indeed; not alone for the resurrected Christ, who knew full well that he would arise, but for these faithful women and for all the disciples to whom they carried the glorious message. They restored that if Christ arose from the tomb, man also will arise from his tomb. In this fact mortal life finds its loftiest hope. No greater boon could be fashioned for the souls of men. The two women doubted not the report of the angel, but, at his bidding, hastened \"with fear and great joy\" to carry the glad tidings to those whom Christ affectionately called \"my brethren.\" On the way they met the Christ,\nand were requested to summon his disciples to meet him in a mountain in Galilee. Here in the uplands, against the sky, the Christ whose ministry was now given new force and power gave final instruction to those who should follow him.\n\"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" In these humble, yet powerful words, the Master transmitted to his \"brethren\" the spiritual momentum of the resurrection. As all power was given unto him in heaven and in earth, so a measure of that power would be theirs. Possessed of that power, they were to go forth teaching all nations and bringing them into the fold of Christ. No greater task was ever given to man! But these were empowered men. Their leader had risen from the tomb. The glory and the power of the resurrected Lord motivated their deeds. The Lord's assurance \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" became at once their authority and their commission. The labor and sacrifices of these men in the dark years that followed, bear indubitable evidence that they were motivated by this authority and commission. Thus the divine drama ends. The story of the mortal sojourn of the Christ is told.\nNOW comes a new disclosure of eternal import. The risen Lord ascends into the heavens, as was expected. But, \"while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; Which also said. EASTER AND THE SECOND COMING OF THE LORD 141 Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.\" Thus, as one drama is ended, a new one is proclaimed. As the people in his day looked forward to his resurrection, the generations following thereafter have looked forward to his second coming. Such is our situation today. This generation of men may well witness the fulfillment of this earth-shaking prophesy. But we must be ready for it, for Christ is to come to a people prepared for him. Where is that people? Will the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints be prepared to play that role? Let us ponder for a moment those words of the Roman centurion: 'Truly this was the Son of God.\" Centuries before the birth of Christ, Isaiah had foretold that men should call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, \"God with us.\" Joseph called his name Jesus. Herod, seeking to destroy the infant Christ, asked, \"Where is he that is born King of the Jews?\" Heaven had proclaimed him Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, the everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace, Jehovah, Messiah, Son of David, the Word, the Lamb of God, the Lion of the house of Judah, the Redeemer, the Brightness of the Father's glory, the God of Jacob, the Glory of his people Israel. The Master bore testimony of his own mission in this fashion: \"I AM,\" \"I am the bread of life,\" \"I am the way of truth and the life,\" \"I am the resurrection and the life.\" The Christ has been introduced by the Father in these endearing words, 'This is my beloved Son.\" The scriptures proclaim that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, and it is affirmed that the government shall be upon his shoulders and of his kingdom there shall be no end. All this was unknown to the Roman centurion, yet without this knowledge, this officer of the law deduced the profound truth, the most significant fact in the story of mortal life: \"Truly this was the Son of God.\" Upon that question all men must take their stand. \"There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" \"Every knee must bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ.\" One does not need the discernment of the Roman centurion to comprehend that the power of the Lord Jesus Christ is today dominating the course of world events. He has promised that he will pour out his spirit upon all flesh. Addressing himself to the house of Israel, he has said: \"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you:... I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.... I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.... Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.\" Following these assurances of the cleansing of Israel and of her repentance comes this notable pronouncement: \"Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them.\"\nIt would seem proper to assume that this action on the part of the house of Israel must precede the second coming of the Lord. When the house of Israel however, it may be constituted or represented makes this request of the Lord God \"to do it for them,\" we may be assured that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints intrusted as it is and has been with the commission to gather Israel, and with the keys and authorities of the dispensation of Abraham will assume vast and definite responsibilities in this momentous work. The God of Israel. The mountain of the Lord's house has been established in the tops of the mountains, and has been exalted above the hills; and all nations have flowed unto it. So also has John gone forth in the spirit of Elias, and has turned the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; and has thus \"made ready a people prepared for the Lord.\""

            "content": "Though A Host Encamp Against Thee Dorothy Clapp Rohinson JULIA scraped the coals closer under her bakeoven. Even if she was nearly eleven, bread-making took the starch right out of her. The wood Isaac brought didn't make good coals. She was going to tell Pa well, maybe not now. Lately Pa didn't seem to love them any more than Heavenly Father did. It wasn't as if they didn't know, 'cause they did. All year the saints had talked and prayed about it, and if that wasn't enough there were her own secret prayers. No, Heavenly Father didn't have the excuse of not knowing; but Pa might not know about the chopping. At noon she had tried to tell him. \"I am not leaving.\" He had scowled at her. \"Nothing short of the United States Army will move me.\" Julia didn't know about the United States Army. All she knew was Johnson Army. Everybody was moving south to get away from him. Everybody, but them. Julia wasn't hankering for a move. She'd had too many of them. This place in the canyon was the only real home she could remember. But burning it and moving south would be better than the chopping. DOROTHY CLAPP ROBINSON \"Brother Williams says he is following the Move so his family will be safe.\" For a moment Pa hadn't spoken. When he did, his voice was the way it sometimes got when they talked about Ma. \"Maybe I should have taken you to your grandma; but Grantsville is a long way.\" He looked about the Page  room. \"I snaked these logs out of the canyon. Your Ma helped me raise them. I will put my trust in the Lord and stay here.\" When Pa used that tone of voice there was no use going on. Trusting was all right for him. He was an old man, nearly thirty-six, and old men are not afraid. Dorcas Williams had whispered to her about the chopping. She said when Old Johnson Army got to the Valley, if he found any young'uns there, he would cut off their ears, and maybe chop off both hands and both feet. Like Squaw Bill. She'd done something and the bucks of her tribe had chopped off her hands. Now she lived with the Williamses. After banking the fire Julia went outside. At the woodpile she found a long, thick sliver. She would use it to try the bread. Sister Williams had put her on to that. No sense trusting to looks. The first time she had baked after Ma died, she had her lesson. Because the bread was brown she'd thought it was done. Spreading one of Ma's snowy dish-wipers on the hearth, she had lifted the oven to turn out the bread. Instead of coming out in loaves, the crust had broken; and dough had run all over the dishwiper. She'd scooped it back in a hurry with her bare hands, so none of it would be wasted. That had been a mess with burned hands and only slow-poke Sally to help. As Julia started toward the house with her sliver, she saw a curl of smoke far down the Valley then another. The burning had started! That meant Old Johnson Army was close. She sat down on a stump and tears trickled down her thin cheeks. Oh, Ma, why couldn't you have stayed. Pa would listen to you. President Young when he was up to see Pa said, \"You're a brave girl, and don't worry, Ma is happy.\" Huh. Heaven must be something; or Ma had changed in a hurry. She knew Hi was only ten months old and that Sally was slow as molasses in a snowdrift. Well, maybe Old Johnson Army would kill all of them. It would be a relief, at that, to turn Sally and Isaac over to Ma. FOR supper they had bread'n'milk and Injun-meal mush. Pa got a slice of the new bread. He worked hard, and if he liked it, he might listen about the chopping. He liked it. He even said Julia would soon be as good a breadmaker as her mother; but when she tried to talk \"Move\" he laid down his spoon and looked at her. \"I am not being chased out of my home again. Besides, when you put your trust in the Lord you leave it up to him.\" \"We'll be alone. Everybody is go- \"Some won't go. You wouldn't want to go without me, would you?\" \"No-o.\" She blinked back the tears that stung her eyeballs. The young'uns had all stopped eating to listen. \"No, but there is Tommy and Baby .\" Pa broke a crust of his new bread and gave it to Baby Hi, who was in the highchair by him. He put an extry spoonful of molasses on Tommy's mush. The quiet was something turrible, and Pa's hand shook sb some of the molasses spilled. At last he looked straight at Julia. He really was an old man. \"I have thought about it, and THOUGH A HOST ENCAMP AGAINST THEE 145 prayed about it, and listened to counsel. I am going to stay.\" Just then Isaac tipped over his milk. Julia boxed his ears, but by the time she'd cleaned it up Pa was gone, saying he was going to work late at the gristmill. He took John with him. John was two years older than Julia, and worked with Pa now. Later, Julia lay staring into the darkness. She was in Pa's bed in the front room so she could watch Tommy and Baby. There was no use closing her eyes when Old Johnson Army stayed right in front of them. She raised on her elbow. By the light of the moon shining through the open doorway she could see the little ones. Baby Hi had one chubby fist under his cheek. Tommy was on his back with arms and legs outstretched. Just imagine that old sooner hurting them! She didn't care if Pa got clean out of patience with her; she was not going to see them hurt. If neither Pa nor Heavenly Father was going to do anything, she would have to. SLOWLY an idea came to her. It grew and grew. She would get Bally from the pasture. He was gentle and would carry five. She would bundle some didies and food, and they would leave before Pa got back. With them gone, Pa and John could hide. It was terrible to go again your own father, but she had a duty to the young uns. Slipping out of bed, she dressed hurriedly. As she stood a moment in the doorway, a lump swelled in her throat. Something just like one of Ma's arms held her tight to the place. The moon was high. The mountains had moved close and the run-along song of the crick was enough to wake the dead. Warm chills ran up her back. After the heat and dust of the plains it was like well, like having Ma after not having her. Leaving the yard, she walked toward the pasture where they kept Bally. The gristmill stood out like a ghost. It was made of logs, like the house. Until lately, both had seemed so safe and strong. Especially after the plains. She couldn't remember Nauvoo much, and about all she could remember of Winter Quarters was tents and wagons. She could remember how cold the Platte River was for she had fallen into it. She could remember an Injun trying to buy her, and she could remember Jim Bridger's squaws. Leastways she could remember their bright blankets. But her best remembering was of heat and dust, and how tired her legs got gathering buffalo chips. She had never rightly understood about the moving. Everyone said, have faith, the Lord will give us a home, but that hadn't stopped the wagons. Until they reached the Valley, it hadn't. No one had kept up with the moving more willingly than the Phippens. She didn't blame Pa for not wanting to start that again. Still-. Bally wasn't in the pasture. Just her luck to have Pa using him. She'd sneak up. If the mill was running, she might get him away without being heard. There was no light in the mill. The big door was open but there was no sign of Pa or John. The inside dark was so quiet she could hear a rat gnawing. What if they had skipped? For shame, Julia Phippen. Pa'd never do that in Kingdom Come. You thought that 'cause you are doing it to him. But she was taking the young'uns to safety. A sound from the hillside made her turn. She waited breathlessly until it came again. It was Bally sneezing. Now what was he doing up there? Slipping from shadow to shadow she approached a small grove on a near slope. Within the grove was a small cave where the young'uns often played. Among the trees the light was dim, and, for a moment, she could see nothing. Then she saw them. They must have been using him, for Bally was tied to a quaker. Pa and John were piling brush and dead branches over the mouth of the cave, but helter-skelter to make it look natural. 'Think anyone will find it?\" she heard John ask. \"Never,\" Pa answered. \"We can move it after the trouble is over.\" Julia forgot Bally. She forgot why she had come. She remembered only that here was more trouble, and different than she had dreamed of. Now she couldn't run out on Pa no matter what he had done. Back in bed she tried to smother her hard breathing. Directly she heard them come in. Baby Hi fussed a little as Pa lay down beside him, but almost at once Pa was snoring. Then Julia looked at her thoughts. They had buried something. It must be turrible or they wouldn't make a secret of it. Maybe they had killed an Injun, or maybe even Old Johnson Army. Maybe he had come sneaking around to do the chopping and they had beat him to it. Pa was in Dutch either way. If it was Johnson Army, the Gove'-ment  she didn't know what that was but everyone talked about it-would be on his trail. If it was an Injun her heart beat suffocatingly. You can't fool Injuns for long. Besides, Pa might be called before the Brethren. He might even be in danger of hell-fire. The scriptures said something about shedding innocent blood. She hoped Injun blood wasn't too innocent, but who had the say-so? Every way she looked there was a thick black wall. She just had to have help. She'd try Heavenly Father again. Ma had been strong on prayer. Slipping out of bed she knelt down and put her face against the bedding. Protect them all, especially Pa and John, and if it had to be a killing they'd done, let it be Johnson Army. Some good would come of that, but killing an Injun would be all bad. Let Pa lose his stubborn streak and light out, come daybreak. Maybe they could still catch up with the others. Suddenly, she realized she was talking more to Ma than to Heavenly Father. Likely he would overlook it, seeing she was one of his newest angels. JULIA woke, heavy with dread, but the morning was so bright she could almost believe she dreamed about the cave. If her prayer was to be answered, now was the time. Pa was stirring the mush when she entered the kitchen. She hastened to wipe off the table and set out the dishes. All the time she listened for the word from Pa, but it didn't come. Her mush stuck in her throat. Maybe Heavenly Father THOUGH A HOST ENCAMP AGAINST THEE 147 hadn't liked the way she prayed after all. She hadn't said thy will 'cause she wanted her will this time. Three times she caught Pa looking at her. He told her again what a good bake she got on the bread. He warned Isaac and Sally he'd tend to them if they didn't help more. As he was leaving, he took his gun. \"Keep no bring the young'uns up to the mill when your work is done. They can play around up there.\" Julia made herself real busy so she wouldn't look at him. Her last hope was gone. A heavy ache inside made her feet big and her hands slow. Pa pretended to be working hard, but he stopped every little while to stand looking. Most often his eyes turned toward the canyon where lay the road into the Valley. He kept his gun close beside him. The sun hadn't found the bottom of the canyon yet when a rider came pounding up to the yard of the mill. It was Jim Ashley, and Pa came out to talk to him.  This is your last chance\" Julia heard Jim say. \"Tomorrow will be too late. What's a mill anyway?\" \"The saints will need flour wherever they are.\" Pa spoke real slow but every word stood out. \"Mills don't grow on trees. I am staying with mine.\" Julia was right proud of him for a minute; but if Brother Ashley couldn't budge him, no one could. The best she could do was keep the young'uns close around. What happened to one would happen to all. About noon Lafe Cartright came by. He had been left to do the burning if it came to that. Some, he said, had got in a hurry and done the burning themselves. Pa agreed that was foolish. \"Well, it will soon be over,\" Lafe called, as he rode away. Julia was past all feeling. If the worst, was to come, it would, only she hadn't thought God would be one-sided. She had tried to be good; as good as Dorcas, but the Williamses were safe. 'Course she couldn't put all the blame on Heavenly Father, but if he could move mountains why couldn't he change Pa's mind? As soon as Lafe was out of sight, Julia moved Baby Hi close by the mill steps. She called Tommy to come play on the blanket with him. She tried to mend, but the patch kept puckering. Finally she threw it aside. The minutes were endless. Suddenly, John let go with a loud yell from the roof of the mill where Pa had stationed him. \"Here they come.\" Quicker than skat Pa shinned up the corner of the mill and was looking to where John pointed. Isaac and Sally climbed the big tree that hung over the crick. \"I can see them,\" Isaac shouted, and Sally added her, \"I can, too.\" Julia started to climb the mill, but halfway up she turned back. The mill roof was too far away. She stood on a stump near the babies. She looked where the others were looking, and, suddenly, she saw a thousand or maybe even a million points of light, like the sun hitting guns. \"What is it?\" she called, eager to share what the others were seeing. \"The Army,\" Pa was breathing hard like he had been running. \"Johnson's Army. Caught up with us at last.\" \"I can't see good,\" Sally cried. Trying to move, she slipped and fell into the water with a yell and a splash. By the time they had pulled her out and changed her clothes and rubbed arnica on her bruises, the Army was gone. Pa went back up and locked the mill, and then he helped lay out an early supper. He even got a jar of Ma's sarvis-berry jelly. Three times in the night, Julia heard him walking around. LATE evening of the next day, Jim Ashley came back. Pa hadn't been at the mill all day, and it seemed he couldn't wait for Jim to get there. He went a piece to meet him. When he came back he sat down on the doorstep. He looked so happy Julia sat down beside him. The young'uns, except John, were in bed; and darkness filled all the hollows. \"What did Jim say?\" she asked finally. \"It's over.\" Pa's voice sounded as young as John's only it didn't squeak. 'The Lord was with, us even as I doubted.\" Julia looked at him in surprise. \"Were you afraid?\" \"I was scared stiff.\" \"What's Johnson's Army, Pa, and why did the saints have to move?\" \"We thought we were in for trouble again. We thought the soldiers would take our homes and we were not going to let that happen again. We would burn them first. That is why men were left to set fires.\" The gid looked around at the mountains in the back, with the moon just peeping over the rim. She looked at the lake in the distance, and the sloping Valley between. It was wonderful to have a home that was safe and strong and a Pa that was scared but stayed anyway. She could talk to him now. Words tripped over her tongue trying to get said. She told about the chopping and how she thought Johnson Army was a cruel giant. She even owned up to her feelings against him and Heavenly Father. Pa listened without saying a word. It was bright moonlight now, and she could see slow tears run down into his whiskers. He drew her close against him. \"Poor little young'un,\" he said, \"I have been so wrapped up in my own worries I have overlooked yours. I have expected too much of you, but it seems like you are my right hand.\" Julia hardly breathed. She didn't want to spoil the sweetness of that moment, but she must know one thing more. \"What about the Injun, Pa?\" \"What Injun?\" his voice was puzzled. \"The one you buried in the cave.\" Slowly Pa's eyes came alive. He started to laugh, quietly at first, then lively. She hadn't heard such fun in his voice since before Ma took sick. \"The Injun we buried was flour. That is why Brother Young was up to see me. We thought we might lose the mill but we couldn't take chances on the flour.\" Through the soft light she could see the trust in his eyes. \"We were wrong, both of us. We forgot there are many ways for prayers to be answered. His way was much better than yours or THOUGH A HOST ENCAMP AGAINST THEE 149 mine. The Army has gone on down to the Jordan. There isn't going to be any trouble.\" Suddenly the breadmaking, the care of the young'uns were mere trifles. Heavenly Father had remembered them. A verse Ma used to read came to her mind. \"Some put their trust in chariots; and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord, our God.\" Yes. She would always remember.

            "content": "The Story of a Gifted Lady Leah D. Widtsoe ALICE MERRILL HORNE HE was an unlearned, ordinary looking farmer's lad, who had spent his days at farm drudgery, for his parents were struggling to make the farm produce a scanty living for their growing family. But within him dwelt the power to see beauty in the glowing sunsets, the bright tints of autumn, and the glorious light effects on the mountains, clouds, and valleys wherever he worked. Even the good earth talked to him as he turned the brown fur-Page 150 rows for spring planting. He also possessed the gift of putting on paper or canvas or anything on which he could lay his hands, the pictures which crowded through his mind. So, instead of spending his scanty earnings on new clothes, or guns and powder, with which to kill God's innocent creatures, he bought paper, crayons, paints, and oils, and transferred the pictures of his mind to paper or canvas, until his home was crowded with the results of his leisure efforts. At first his mother encouraged him, but later began to feel that he should be spending his time on something more profitable. Then one day, through a lucky chance, he met A Fairy Godmother She took the time to visit his home, recognized his gift, and told him that he should cultivate it. When told how impossible that would be financially, she volunteered to sell his pictures, thereby helping him to raise money with which to attend a great art school in the East. Then this dainty, but indomitable, art patron went to a number of the well-to-do people in the city, told them the story of the gifted farmer's lad, and soon had sold enough of his pictures to enable him to achieve the ambition of his life. This good lady has rendered similar service for many of Utah's gifted sons and daughters. She has been, and still is, a real fairy godmother THE STORY OF A GIFTED LADY 151 to them, and through her encouragement has taken a leading role in making Utah art conscious. Wouldn't you like to know more about her? Her life story begins in the days when the pioneers were called to settle remote parts of the (then) Territory, and it bristles with tales of Indian unrest as well as the romance of state-building. It is as exciting and interesting as any which begins with the intriguing Once Upon A Time Once in a very great while, an especially gifted spirit is sent to earth to take a body and become a blessing to many people and the state, as well as to family and friends. Such a precious spirit came to the frontier log cabin home of Clarence Merrill and Bathsheba Smith, who were each descended from stalwart Utah pioneers. The father was called by Brigham Young to learn telegraphy, and then to settle first at Cove Creek Fort, that outpost of Indian activity, and later to take care of telegraph operations at Fillmore, which was then the capital of Utah Territory. There a baby daughter was born to them, and was named Alice Smith Merrill. She grew to be a lovely child, who was later to honor highly the name and the lineage she bears. Two of her great-grandparents. Patriarch John Smith and his wife Clarissa Loomis Lyman, were pioneers of 1847, and all four of her grandparents were early pioneers also. Her grandfather, George A. Smith, was both Church historian and first counselor to President Brigham Young, while her grandmother, Bathsheba W. Smith, was the fourth general president of the Relief Society. Two of her great-grandparents passed away before reaching the \"Valley.\" Thus Alice is a true daughter of pioneers, and the fourth generation of believers in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. The girlhood of this favored child was passed in the ideal environment of a fine, two-story brick home (evolved from the log cabin) located in a quarter block of garden and orchard, in company with a large family of brothers and sisters to help make life a round of merriment as well as of struggle. There were vegetables and fruits to be gathered in summer, wild strawberries and native black currants, choke cherries, and service berries to be brought from the canyons; fruit to be canned and dried in autumn; with quilt blocks to make and rags to be sewed for carpets during the long winter hours when school was out. These chores were varied with pleasurable activities, for her parents were leaders in the Fillmore Dramatic Society, as well as being gifted with musical talents. Around the family hearthstone the family often re-enacted stirring scenes from history or from Shakespeare, each dressing, as best he could, in character. The mother always had a lovely flower garden, and Alice early learned to appreciate the beauties of mountains, streams, blue skies, and cloud effects, as well as the glories of summer gardens and winter scenes of snowy grandeur. In fact, the love of beauty seemed to be a part of her very being, for she sought it in the everyday tasks as well as in her moments of leisure. She loved to draw, and early showed aptitude in transferring to paper the images of her mind. She was a good student also, for when but a child she took a prize in the old rock schoolhouse as the best reader. Then when but eight years old came her Great Adventure After the passing of her grandfather, George A. Smith, her grandmother (\"Aunt Bathsheba\" to all the other daughters of Zion) was living alone, and lonely. So she invited her granddaughter, Alice, to come to \"the city\" and live with her in the old Historian's Office, next to the magnificent Gardo House, which was then the official residence of the president of the Church. What a rare experience for this beauty-loving child! Here she helped her grandmother read and sort old letters, classified the hundreds of pictures her grandfather had brought from his trips to Europe and the Holy Land, met and learned to know all the great men and women of early Mormon history, who were intimate friends of her grandmother. From a child to young womanhood, she became associated with the early development of the Relief Society in the new Zion; also the Retrenchment Society, as well as the suffrage movement for Women's Rights, so-called. Meetings for these activities, as well as those of the Women's Deseret Hospital, Woman's Exponent (the pioneer women's newspaper), and many others of pioneer interest, were all conducted in her grandmother's back parlor. Alice was an ardent listener and youthful participant. It is no wonder that she became \"organization-minded.\" When but nine years old she felt to organize the young girls into a society, which they called \"The Juvenile Association.\" She chose six counsellors  instead of two among them the youngest daughter of Brigham Young, Fanny V., Katie B. Fen ton, Lutie Y. Thatcher, Lulu Clawson, Ada Croxall, Edna Wells, with Daisy Woods, a granddaughter of Emme-line B. Wells, as secretary. They visited and prayed for the sick, and later joined, in a body, the first organized Primary Association. Meanwhile, Alice was using her pencil and sketch book as well as attending school. While in Miss Mary Cook's school, she won the prize for the best drawing a sketch from memory given by Dr. Ellen B. Ferguson. Later, she won an award given by the early Utah artist and teacher at the University of Deseret  now the University of Utah-George M. Ottinger. Still later, she won a medal offered by the artist J. T. Harwood, which was awarded by John Hafen, one of Utah's greatest artists. This was naturally a stimulus to her innate desire to produce pictures herself, and to foster in others the love of art, to which her life has been devoted. But art did not claim all her interest. In 1887, she was graduated from the University of Utah. She wrote her thesis on two of Shakespeare's women  Lady Macbeth and Ophelia. Her interest in good literature has always been keen. In 1890, Alice married George Henry Home, also a descendant of stalwart pioneers. He was an ideal husband for this talented woman, for besides being a fine man Jn his own right, he was openminded enough to recognize the"

In 1893, they visited the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and later went to New York, Washington, Boston, San Francisco, and the Northwest, visiting especially the art galleries and other places of interest. In 1894, the young husband was called on a mission to the Southern States. Alice, being a good soldier, taught art in the public schools while he was gone. She also undertook serious work in art from J. T. Harwood, who had just returned from study in the Julian and Beaux Arts Academies of Paris, France. She also studied from Mary Teasdel, student of James McNeill Whistler. In 1898, she was urged by many friends to run for the legislature. In this, as in her many other activities, her husband counselled her acceptance. Said he, \"Wifey,\" (his pet name for her) \"if you want to help Utah to become art-minded, you will have to get in there and work for it.\" She was elected, and made herself noteworthy by introducing a bill which provided for an annual exhibition and state art collection. Georgina G. Marriott as director of fine arts at the State Fair put the exhibition into Alice's hands, and for five years she made the Art Gallery famous. Instead of giving many prizes, the best pictures were purchased, making them the property of the State as well as encouraging the artists. This greatly encouraged art studies and Utah artists also, establishing the nucleus of an art collection by the State of Utah, which was named in honor of the originator, \"The Alice Art Collection.  ALICE MERRILL HORNE AS A GIRL Thus the Utah Art Institute was established, making Utah the first state in the Union to own a state art collection. Many prominent people made gifts of paintings, and this collection of over seventy pictures is now housed in the upper galleries of the State Capitol. After an existence of over forty years and an expenditure of over $60,000, the act was repealed in the interest of the so-called \"Modern Art\" (or is it art?) which at great expense is trying to convert the public to what is considered the New Art. Mrs. Home has remained true to her ideals of real beauty, however, and has turned much of her interest to sponsoring and providing art exhibitions for the public schools of the State. She has established over thirty art collections, of from fifteen to fifty paintings, by Utah's best artists. Hundreds of exhibitions have been held, and many thousands of dollars have thus been turned to Utah artists aside from the greater value of instilling a love of beauty and art in the lives of the younger generation. For fourteen years from 1902 to 1916 Mrs. Home was a member of the Relief Society General Board, and while there was active in preparing lessons on art appreciation and landscape study, which were used by the 40,000 members of the Relief Society. A book on this subject \"Devotees and Their Shrines, A Handbook of Art\" was later published. Another book written in dramatic form called \"Columbus Westward Ho!\" was published and used in the public schools for a time. Many other interests claimed her attention during all these years of active service. She is a charter member of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, and was instrumental in framing its constitution and bylaws; she was also its second general president. She sponsored a \"Clean Milk for Utah\" campaign, and as chairman of Public Health helped, with others, to arouse enough public sentiment to cause rigid inspection to be enforced for the benefit of all, especially babies. Four milk stations were opened in different parts of the city. Many babies died in Salt Lake City among them her own baby son, George Henry, Jr.  while the next summer only one baby death was reported! Mrs. Home was also active, with others, in organizing the Smokeless Fuel Federation, and for many years has labored to encourage the use of smokeless fuel and byproducts from Utah coals. She, with other forward-looking women, was instrumental in the formation of the Women's Chamber of Commerce, which has labored to make smokeless fuel a possibility for improving the health of Utah residents and the beauty of her towns and cities. Honors Have Sought Her For her many activities, Mrs. Home has rightly received merited recognition. In 1904, she represented the National Council of Women, as well as the National Women's Relief Society, at the International Council of Women, held in Berlin, Germany. In 1934, she was chosen by the Salt Lake City Council of Women as one of the first outstanding women, named by that body, for her many contributions and life-long promotion of art among the citizens of the State. Her latest honor was received in 1942, when she was given a Medal of Honor from the Academy of Western Culture for her civic service, especially in the promotion of Utah art appreciation and production. A large reception was held in the President's Suite at the Hotel Utah, with Mr. And Mrs. Alexander Schreiner, and Mr. And Mrs. Lee Greene Richards in charge of the ceremonies. Many prominent Utahns came to meet the little lady so greatly honored. All these awards have been richly deserved, and have done honor to the donors as well as to the recipient. One might think that a life so crowded with achievement would be enough for one small lady, but there remains yet to be told Her Great Achievement' In addition to the many activities enumerated above, her greatest hon- THE STORY OF A GIFTED LADY 155 or and award is the gift of Motherhood. Six children three sons and three daughters have come to bless the home of this favored family. Five of them have grown to a useful maturity Mary, Lyman, Virginia, Zora,' and Albert. They are all members of the Church and are leaders in their fields of labor. Two of them, Dr. Lyman and Dr. Albert, are successful doctors of medicine, while the two married daughters-Mary, Mrs. Leo C. Winder, and Zora, Mrs. J. G. Jeppson are making good homes and raising fine families. They are all active in civic betterment. Mr. Home met an untimely death in 1934, mother has continued to carry on her home duties as well as her many public activities. Alice has always had a sweet, attractive face; but to those who know her best, it seems that the halo of white hair frames a face growing more mellow and charming with the passing years. Though now approaching what some may designate as 'getting on in years,\" she still seems as young as ever, and is active in staging art exhibits in the Tea Room or a nine-window art show at Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution, or some school where art-appreciation is needed. When one sees her \"toting\" around the heavy pictures, placing them where they receive their best light, or may be seen to the best advantage (so that possible sales may reward the artist), one feels to exclaim, \"What a Woman!\" How wise to foster a life interest which may remain when children are grown and home ties are lessened! How much better it is to have work to do that helps others more than oneself, rather than to sit idly at home, allowing or expecting one's children to \"take care of one's old age.\" What a glorious thing is independence! Wliat an achievement to know that one's life work is being well done, in spite of circumstances or the passing years. Such a blessing is the well-earned reward of our gifted lady, Alice Merrill Home. And here, dear friend, while you are living and working, is our bouquet of appreciation and admiration! GIFTS Grace A. Cooper When gods of sound and goddesses of color send Down gifts to man, their gems and blooms and music blend; Like silence, drugged, the pearl-gray fog escapes the bay, Soft murmurs from the golden glow of summer day Join whispered converse of the leaves of verd and jade; Late roses echo reds of rubies' deeper shade. When beryls raise their batons, all is statue-still, Then amethysts and violets, in cadence, trill; Turquoise and larkspur improvise a symphony, The diamond and jasmine play their melody. Between the black and darkened clouds are silver rifts  For gods and goddesses, to mankind, blend their gifts. Sixtii LJears Kjigo Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, March i and March 15, 1885 \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations\" Love. This is a little word of only four letters, yet how potent, how powerful, and with it comes our liberty or bondage. If we love right, we are free; free in our souls, pure in our hearts, let come what may, though oft through surrounding circumstances and worldly influence we are swerved from the right, not having the moral courage to resist evil, or know for ourselves the sad results of weakness and hatred until too late.... Where can we find pure love? In the homes of the Latter-day Saints; there it sits enthroned. If sorrow and death visit such a household there is comfort and relief at hand.... Our principles are perfect, and we will continue to love them and strive to live them, God being our helper; protect the rights of others, envy no one, be pure in our daily walk in life and leave the result in God's hands. Zina D. H. Young. Editorial Notes: On Saturday, March yth, a number of ladies, intimate friends of Mrs. Rachel R. Grant, met at her residence in the 13th Ward, it being the anniversary of the lady's birthday. The time was spent in social converse, supper being announced at six p.m., when the guests repaired to the residence of Apostle H. J. Grant, where a sumptuous repast had been prepared for the occasion. The table was handsomely set out, and the viands were delicious. Mrs. Lucy Grant, the amiable hostess, and her sister, Mrs. JuHa Woolley, with Miss Maggie Ivins assisting, waited upon the ladies in the most charming manner, and every one seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves. About ten o'clock the party broke up. Many good wishes were expressed for the lady who is a great favorite with her friends. May she live to enjoy many more years of prosperity and happiness.  R.S. REPORTS Alma Ward, Mesa City. Editor Exponent: Owing to our isolated situation we see but few communications from this part of the country in your valuable paper, hence the liberty I take in penning a few lines to you, hoping you will be kind enough to give them space in your paper. We were organized May 31st, 1883, under the direction of President McDonald, with Anna Klienman, President; Henrietta Standage and Laureta Staples, Counselors; Sarah M. Mullens, Secretary; Sophronia A. Standage, Assistant Secretary; Hannah M. Stewart, Treasurer. We have thirty-five names enrolled, with an average attendance of nineteen. We hold our meetings semi-monthly, and have a very good time. The sisters are trying to live their religion and serve God. The Exponent is read in our meetings, with other Church works, striving to render them a source of benefit and mutual improvement. Wishing f Jr the success of the Exponent, I remain, Your sister in the Gospel, S. A. S. Bluff City. Editor Exponent: Thinking that a few lines from Bluff City would not come amiss, we take pleasure in writing that our Relief Society is trying to keep along evenly with the rest of the branches of the Relief Society as near as possible under the circumstances, with a good spirit and feeling at heart. We hold our testimony and teacher's meetings once a month, and our working meetings once in two weeks. We are few in number, but our meetings are well attended and our desire is to do all the good we can in helping to build up the Kingdom of God in this far off land.... We have had a very pleasant winter and the health of the people is very good. There has been no sickness nor death, for which we feel very thankful, and realize as a great blessing. Ever praying for the welfare of Zion, we remain, Your sisters in the Gospel, Jane M. Walton, President; Irene Haskell, Secretary."

            "content": "Gratitude For Church Guidance ONE hundred and three years will have passed this March seventeenth since the first auxiliary of the Church, the Relief Society, was established for the benefit of its members and for the good of others. In that year, 1842, the Church had risen triumphant through its first twelve momentous years. It had been driven from New York to Ohio, from Missouri to Illinois, and already the necessary laws and powers for the coming forth and future progress of the Church had been revealed and confirmed. It was during that all-too-brief period of calm between the lashing storms of persecution, while the Church lay, as it were, at safe anchorage on the broad blue waters of the Mississippi at Nauvoo, that a few of the Church women gave utterance to their longing to be formed into an organization so that their united efforts might more speedily and effectually accomplish tasks allotted to them. It is significant that these women did not themselves inaugurate a society, but turned to their Prophet-leader for guidance. At a time and place set by him, he organized them, and under his continued tutelage thus was instituted the Relief Society which grew in one hundred years from a membership of eighteen to over one hundred thousand. The broad basic principles which Page 158 have always governed the Society were laid by the Prophet Joseph Smith; however the planning and putting into execution of these policies have always been entrusted to the officers and members of the Society, who fully merited the confidence thus reposed in them, manifesting a devotion to duty, throughout the years, which has resulted in an immeasurable amount of labor, of loving service, and of enlightenment. Relief Society is obedient to the leadership of Church authorities today as it was one hundred years ago, and stands ready to accept and support new policies as they are deemed desirable. So guided and so conducted, the advancing years will find the Society growing ever more powerful, more potent in building testimonies of the gospel in members, more fully fulfilling its high destiny. On this one hundred and third anniversary, Relief Society members acknowledge the gratitude of their hearts for the guidance of the general and local authorities, for their zealous, watchful care to the end that the services rendered by Relief Society women are being extended in everwidening spheres to keep pace with the accelerated need for such services in the expansion and progression of the Church. M. C. S. EDITORIAL 159 Sarah Eddington?Ida Peterson Beal EARLY in the New Year, two faithful and devoted former members of the General Board of Relief Society passed to the great beyond, in the persons of Sarah Eddington and Ida Peterson Beal. The death of Sister Eddington occurred on January 9, and that of Sister Beal on January 6. In many respects the lives of these two good sisters were similar. They were both daughters of early Utah pioneers, were reared in families where faith and devotion to the gospel were paramount, and their testimonies of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the restored gospel were fervent and strong. Miss Eddington was born June 13, 1861 in Salt Lake City. She was the daughter of William and Sarah Fry Eddington, English converts. From her childhood days she was active in the Church in many capacities. She served as a valued member of the General Board of Relief Society for seven years ?from March 1914 to April 1921. Previous to this she was a member of the General Board of the Y. W. M. LA. For twenty-five years. She was an untiring worker, always willing to do more than her share. She was an efficient committee member and travelled extensively for both the Relief Society and the Y. W. M. IA. Although she was rather frail and delicate physically, she used to say, \"Send me on the long, hard trips; I have no home to take care of, no husband, and no children. I am free and my chief interest in life is the Church and its progress.\" Sister Eddington was especially gifted as a public speaker. She was both eloquent and impressive, and was always able to hold her audience whether it was made up of children, young people, or those of mature years. IDA PETERSON BEAL was born in Ephraim, Sanpete County, Utah, on February 7, 1876, the daughter of President Canute Peterson and Chariotte Eckstrom Peterson. Her Church interests and activities began early and continued throughout her life in the various auxiliary organizations of the Church. She was appointed to the General Board of Relief Society in August 1927, where she served faithfully and efficiently for thirteen years. Sister Beal received her education in the schools of her native town, at the Snow Academy, and at the Brig-ham Young University. In the last named institution she majored in music under the tutelage of Professor A. C. Lund, and became one of his star pupils and one of the sweetest singers in Zion. She took the leading role in the first opera produced by Brigham Young University. Sister Beal had many opportunities for study and travel, and she made the most of them. She accompanied her husband, Dean T. A. Beal of the University of Utah, to \nNew York where, for three years, he studied at Columbia University. She later accompanied him to Europe where, for one year, they both took advantage of educational and cultural opportunities there. Probably Sister Berit's greatest contribution to the General Board was as chairman of the music committee in which capacity she directed the annual\norganization, and was instrumental in developing the great central chorus of Singing Mothers. However, she travelled extensively to stake Night Society conferences where her lovely spirit and sweet personality won friends and supporters to the great Relief Society cause.\nA.B.L."

Wielders of hammer, pen, and loom, and saber. Alike must live upon their daily toil. Under the summer sun they do their duty, Loosing the ground that roots and stalks may grow, Coaxing to richness and productive beauty The waving ear and tassel, row on row. Comes a bright day when autumn's sun is slanting Its mellow rays across the golden grain. They gather then the harvest of their planting. Grateful that they have labored not in vain. All these are praying hands. An old petition Their labor makes?one that has long been said By those of every country and condition: \"Give us, we ask, this day, our daily bread.\" Notes TO THE FIELD Materials for the 1945 Welfare Clothing Budget THE following information regarding materials for the 1945 welfare clothing budget has been received by the General Board from the General Church Welfare Committee: In the fall of 1944 the Clothing Committee submitted a report to the General Welfare Committee which covered the materials that would be needed for the 1945 welfare clothing budget assignment. At that time, information which had previously been supplied by government officials in Washington indicated that it was probable that the materials for this clothing assignment would be made available to the Welfare Program. In the latter part of December the situation changed and it then became apparent that most of the materials, which we proposed to use, were still critically needed in the war effort. It has, therefore, been decided that while present conditions exist, it will not be advisable to file for priorities. The clothing program will proceed as materials become available to which we are properly entitled on a quota basis. The most recent information from the wholesale houses with which the General Committee has heretofore done business is that there is no immediate prospect of securing the clothing materials in the quantities that are required to fill the 1945 budget assignment. It is the plan of the General Committee to keep in close touch with the market and take advantage of the full quota of materials as they become available. This means that it will not be possible for the General Committee to supply the materials needed so that the budget can be completed during the first six months of this year as many of the Relief Society sisters desire. It is hoped, however, that materials will be available so that the budget can be completed by the end of 1945. As materials are received, they will be allocated in a fair manner to those to whom the budgets have been assigned. The question has arisen as to whethei stake or ward welfare committees shall be encouraged to purchase materials from lo cal sources to complete their clothing assignments. If materials can be purchased at wholesale prices without working a hardship on the community, it will be proper for the stake and ward welfare committees to purchase such materials and advise the General Committee so that the General Committee will not overpurchase later on. However, if it is necessary to go into the retail markets and pay retail prices and take from the shelves of local merchants materials that are needed to meet the general needs of the local community, such purchases should not be made. Where quilting is done, the General Committee can supply the batts needed from stocks now on hand. During the time that materials for welfare sewing are not available, the General Board recommends that Relief Society women devote themselves to other sewing activities on the"

Parker Member of Relief Society General Board Chairman Home Division, Utah Safety Council WHILE the best of the country's young manhood are giving their lives that we here at home may be safe and free, the accident casualties every year in our homes are more than 35,000 killed and 120,000 permanently injured, to no purpose and without good reason.\nMore than half of all accidents occur in and around the homes, and the greatest percentage of the victims are children under five and elderly people over sixty-five years of age. They are victims of ignorance, of carelessness, recklessness or neglect. Accidents do not happen, they are caused by some unsafe practice or condition.\nThe first National Home Farm Safety Conference was held in Chicago, February 17-18, 1942, to focus attention on the seriousness of the nation's home and farm accident situation, and to afford an opportunity for an open discussion of the problem so that plans could be made for a nation-wide safety program. As a result of this study, the Home and Farm Safety divisions were added to the National Safety Council program. Since then, a majority of the states have included a home and a farm safety division in their safety organizations.\nUtah has kept in step with the na-\nTraffic Safety Council was organized in 1939. In 1942, the State ranked second to Oregon in the Western Division for the best traffic safety record, and, in 1943, received the national grand award in the traffic safety contest.\nThe Utah Safety Council was formed May 19, 1944. Its scope was expanded to include the activities of the Utah Traffic Safety Council, the Women's Safety Council of Utah, and all other groups working in the interest of safety. The consolidation of these groups work under one head was made in the interest of efficiency and against duplication of effort.\nThe Home Division is new in the State and, as in the National Council, is in the pioneer stages of its plans.\nA great nation-wide program has been inaugurated in which all our forces are harnessed to bring a safety consciousness to all Americans. The greatest stress is being placed on education and engineering, two of the three \"E's\" of safety. Enforcement, the third factor, cannot be used in the home as in industry and traffic.\nThis program of education should disseminate the knowledge of the safe use of the many products of this machine age that have found their way into our daily living. Individuals must be made conscious of unsafe conditions and unsafe practices.\nPage 162 MARSHALLING OUR FORCES FOR HOME SAFETY 163. They should be awakened to a personal responsibility in guarding their own safety as well as that of others, and should exert every energy to assure their freedom from accidental injury. The importance of teaching safety in the home is being recognized as the first requisite in the safety program. It is believed that a child brought up in an atmosphere of safety will not be content with unsafe conditions and practices in later years, and that this training wiH have a profound influence on safety problems in general?in the home, on the highway, in industry. To assist in the education for home safety, the Red Cross has added another service?courses of instruction in accident prevention. It is now offering a course \"Home Accident Prevention.\" Tliere is need, at present, for certified teachers to impart this knowledge to all groups of people. Those who take and fulfill all the requirements of this course can become certified teachers. It is an opportunity to help conserve human life, and also to destroy one of the potent forces which lead to distress and suffering. The Home Division of the Utah Safety Council is sponsoring classes in home accident prevention as a part of its program of education for home safety. It is issuing an appeal to people, in all groups and walks of life, to take advantage of the course not only for the benefit to themselves in their own homes, but also for the opportunity it gives them to do a fine human service. The Home Division is also planning for a designated week from April 8-14 wherein home safety can be specifically emphasized by all means available?by radio, by the press, by programs in churches, clubs, and schools, and by exhibits and surveys. It is hoped that by these activities a public awareness to the existence of hazards may be awakened, and a general desire to remove or avoid them be stimulated. The world would be a much better place in which to live if accidents could be prevented and, by marshalling all our forces to this end, much can be accomplished. 10 A LITTLE GIRL Jo Adelaide Stock Joy fills my heart, sweet, when I see The precious promises in thee.

            "content": "March Designs For Summer Hazel D. Moyle OF all the year's calendar, March is the least loved month. . . . And passing few are they who speak, wild, stormy month, in praise of thee.\" . . . Yet March has an important place in the year's garden work.\nIt is true that we can do but little out of doors at this early season?a fact which we soon discover when we venture out into our wet and sodden flower beds. But we can find solace, at this time of year, for that first hunger for green growing things which springs up so violently in the breast of every garden lover. We can not only elect our winter-weary selves, but we can assure our gardens an early and abundant bloom next summer by starting seeds indoors in early March.\nCertain vegetables can also be started indoors with profit; that intriguing new tomato, \"Change Jubilee\" must be grown from your own sowing of seeds if you are to enjoy its piquant flavor and unusual appearance come next August, for few nurserymen offer ready-grown plants of this new variety.\nOne can, it is true, now purchase most kinds of annuals all readygrown for planting out when May arrives, but such ready-made plants under the present war conditions command a fairly high price. If your planting spaces are large, it will certainly pay you to try to raise your own plants. One can, if she is successful, reap an entire garden-full of plants by means of a few packages of seeds plus a little honest effort.\nAnd there is the added advantage of being able to select just those colors, varieties, and kinds that suit one's own personal tastes.\nIt is especially profitable to make early March sowings of such annuals as the following: petunia, the most brilliant blooming of all (plant the low bedding varieties for garden decoration, and the giant ruffled kinds for cutting); lobelia, that tiny low-edging plant of such blazing, glowing blue color; snapdragon, rivaling petunias for constant all-year bloom, plus variety in coloring (we plant many shades of pink, flame, yellow, and crimson); verbena, these soon completely cover any wide space with a gorgeous, low carpet of fragrant color; stock . . . Ah me! the lovely, clean perfume of blossoming stocks; and ageratum, flower of soft blue, an exquisite peacemaker among our flower beds (plant this near the front line). All of these need an early start indoors if you are to have them blossoming from late June and on until snow flies.\nTHE requirements for indoor seed planting are few. Foremost is a suitable room in which to keep the seed boxes. The ordinary, well heated living room is too hot and dry for really good results. Choose, if you can, a cooler room, one that is light and airy, and where you can have plenty of ventilation. It should have at least one good sunny window. You might make use of your kitchen to keep the boxes when the seeds are germinating, for they can be kept in any warm room under a table out of the way at this stage, but the moment the tiny things begin to push up the soil, they must have light and air. An unheated, sunny room would be ideal after they are up.\nUse a wooden box four inches deep and from twelve to eighteen inches long; too much depth of soil is not conducive to healthy growth, yet it should be deep enough to accommodate the young roots.\nThe soil used is of the greatest of importance; you should mix this as carefully as you would your Christmas pudding. A sandy soil is best, and some experts use one-third pure sand, one-third good clean dirt, and the last third, real black leaf mold or housewives' garden compost. You may be able to purchase a small sack of soil all mixed and ready to use from some florist or nurseryman, should you not have the above ingredients, and this might be the means of your real success in the venture.\nA layer of broken flower pots, small pebbles, and coarse peat moss should be placed in the bottom of the seed box, then the prepared and sifted soil is placed over this rough drainage to fill the box to within one-half inch of the top. Press the whole down firmly with some board or even a paper magazine to insure no air pockets, especially at corners and edges. Then you are ready for the sowing of seeds.\nAnd here is where we make our greatest mistake, for most amateur gardeners sow the seeds too thickly. Each seed should be sown separately, even the tiny ones such as the petunia. Prepare the box by scattering a\npinch slowly and carefully, then sift a little fine soil over them and press the surface lightly with a spoon. Larger seeds can be planted in rows, covering them with soil three times their own diameter. Do not sow too many, a package of seeds will raise several hundred plants; judge your needs accordingly, and strive for a few well-grown plants rather than too many that are crowded and puny.\nWater by placing the seed box in a large pan or tub containing an inch or two of lukewarm water. Let it stand until the moisture has soaked up into the soil and shows on the surface, then remove the box and drain off for a few moments. Cover with a pane of glass to prevent evaporation, and to maintain even moisture and temperature. On top of the glass place a newspaper to exclude light as germination is best in dark. Place the box in any warm corner to germinate.\nYou should restrain yourself from peeking into the box for a few days, for most of the varieties named above require from ten days to two weeks to germinate. Nevertheless, keep your eye on them, for the soil should be kept moist but not wet, and just as soon as you see the little hummocks pushing up the surface, the paper should be removed to give them light. And as soon as they begin to show green (and no matter how often you have seen this miracle happen, it is always thrilling) the glass should be removed.\nYou must assist your young charges to grow up straight and sturdy by turning the box often as the plants lean towards the light. As soon as two pairs of leaves have developed, they should be transplanted into other boxes of soil to stand two inches apart. They will now need a richer soil. Prepare additional boxes as before except that another part of old, well-rotted manure is added to the soil mixture, and one can also include chemical fertilizer now with excellent results. Purchase any good brand available, and follow directions given on package for its use.\nAs the plants grow they will need more fresh air. One can now shift them outside to a cold frame or any improvised shelter made from an old wooden box if you have a glass cover to fit over the top. An old window frame will serve to protect the glass, or with a rug or old blanket to cover them during cold snaps or nights. As the days grow warmer, the glass covering must be lifted. Strive to harden your plants to the outdoor world, do not fail to cover or protect them if the weather changes. They can be planted out in the garden as soon as all danger of frost is over, usually in May first.\nIn the meantime, the outdoor garden work has begun. Digging and preparation of soil for planting should be started as soon as the ground has dried out sufficiently to permit digging. Use that old method of testing the ground by taking up a handful of soil and squeezing it to a ball; if it will then crumble and fall apart easily, the soil is ready for digging, but if it remains a wet ball, wait a few days longer for it to\ndry. Real damage is done to garden soil by working it while yet, it does not recover its loose, springy mellowness if dug too soon; and roots find it hard to penetrate.\nTrees, shrubs, and especially roses and lilacs should be planted the moment the ground is dry enough to work . . . do not delay a moment if you want them to have a good early start and to prosper well. They can establish early root growth during the cool, early spring before the sun has gained power.\nClean-up time also arrives during March, but be careful in removing any coverings. Loosen and take away coverings gradually. The rose bushes, too, will need their yearly pruning during late March or early April . . . just as soon as killing frosts are over, but not too soon. We must all learn to judge when this time arrives.\nBe warned and leave climbing roses strictly alone at this season (so many amateurs want to trim them in early spring). Wait until the leaves unfold, and then remove only the wood that is actually dead.\nSo we see that March, though she has won such a poor reputation for herself, can be made to yield much in beauty for later months if the home gardener will but use her to good advantage.\nMarch with grief doth howl and rave, And April weeps?but O ye hours! Follow with May's fairest flowers ?Dirge of the Year\"?Shelley RELEASED Thelma Ireland Earth was held, entombed, a prisoner Of the warden, Winter King, Until wafted from her dungeon By the gentle breath of Spring."

            "content": "The Lonesome House Olive Woolley Burt GRANDMA JACKSON never did know just what made her choose a different route home on that sunny, spring day. It might have been, she realized later, the invitation in the south wind that reminded her so of her birthplace; or it might have been the red and yellow tulips in the yard next to Let-tie's, flaunting their individuality almost insolently. But whatever the cause, Grandma Jackson did not turn east at the drugstore corner as she should have done. She went west, instead, and walked two blocks out of her way just so she could pass the park, brave in its new spring dress. Having passed the park, Grandma Jackson didn't even then turn toward Will's house, but wandered along slowly, savoring the sweetness of spring that was carried to her country-born senses by the soft breeze. She came, finally, to a little side street and turned down it, just because it was something like a country lane, with the street unpaved, a ditch of clear water running beside the curb, and tall trees arching over the sidewalk. And it was down this little side street, just about the middle of the block, that Grandma Jackson came upon the little house. It was an old, weather-beaten house, set back from the shady street in a yard overgrown with grass and flowers. Crocuses and daffodils, tulips and hyacinths, that and once apparently been planted in neat borders along the walk, now sprang up everywhere in the lush grass, making the shaggy lawn a veritable crazy patch of gay color. Grandma Jackson put her hand on the rickety gate and looked wistfully into the yard. It was so homelike, so poignantly familiar ? it looked so much the way she felt-little and old and gray, but with vivid, insurgent thoughts. She pushed the gate gently and it swung open, so she went down the neglected walk. The house was obviously empty. The wide porch across the front sagged toward the grassy earth, but Grandma Jackson didn't notice that. She was thinking what a nice porch it would be to sit on of an evening, rocking and dreaming till time to go to bed. She crossed the porch and peered in at the dusty, small-paned windows. She couldn't see much except the bright squares of sunlight on the bare, wooden floor. She went to the door and tried the knob gently; and, when the door yielded, she shrugged her small bent shoulders and walked resolutely in and looked around. There were two rooms. In the one which Grandma Jackson instinctively called the living room were three windows, two facing south and one west. They'd get all the winter sun there is, she thought, seeing her little rocking chair there between the two windows, a crocheted rug beneath her feet, a gray Page  cat purring contentedly in the patch of sunlight. She went into the bedroom and sighed. It was just the right size for her old-fashioned bed and highboy. In the little lean-to kitchen, an old rusty cook stove had been left, and Grandma Jackson's lips curved into a tender smile at sight of it. It was on just such a stove that she had done her first cooking for William; it was at just such a stove he had used to sit of a winter evening, his stockinged feet in the open oven. There was nothing like a coal stove for real warmth and comfort, Grandma Jackson told herself softly. Let the young folks have their furnaces and their gas and oil?a good coal stove was the thing to warm old bones by. She tried the back door, and found it, too, unlocked, so she went into the little back yard, fenced in, and overgrown with currant bushes, a small strawberry patch, and grass everywhere. She heard a trickle and looked about her and found the reason for the lush greenishness. A very tiny spring bubbled through the tangled mass at one side of the yard and ran down a choked ditch to join the ditch along the curb in the front. Grandma Jackson smiled triumphantly, as if she had discovered a looked for treasure. That was why this street was different from all the others. There must be several of these small springs along the block and they gave that special loveliness to the grass and the trees. It was a long time before Grandma Jackson could tear herself away from the little house. She loved it already, as if they two had some secret affinitv. But she knew she shouldn't stay so long. Will's wife, Clara, would be worried. If Lettie had phoned as she usually did to see whether her mother had made the short trip from her house to her brother's safely, they would all be out searching for her. They always told her to go straight along, and here she had flagrantly ignored their advice. She pulled the doors shut carefully and went slowly down the path and out of the rickety gate. She looked back from the sidewalk, and the house peered at her lonesomely from the two windows, the porch roof bent like a wistful eyebrow above them. Grandma Jackson waved gently, to reassure the little house, then squared her shoulders and turned her face purposefully toward her son's house. She arrived before Lettie phoned, before there was any uproar over her vagary. She went to her room and took off her hat, and hung it carefully in the crowded little closet. She looked at her beloved old bed? a piece of furniture Clara hated? and touched the pieced quilt gently as she passed. It would look just right?but she musn't think of that. Downstairs she looked about for her rocker. This had grown to be an unconscious gesture on her part, derived from the habit Clara had of moving Grandma's rocker from place to place in the room, so it wouldn't wear the nap off the carpet. Grandma saw where the little chair now stood and went to it and sat down and tried to knit, but the chair was in a dark corner, and her eyes were dim, and she was dreadfully tired, so she just sat. Will's two grandchildren, noisy and dirty, came into the living room THE LONESOME HOUSE and began to climb over Grandma and her chair. She loved the little fellows, but their hands were sticky. If she got up and took care of them, Clara and Trudy would be offended, taking it as an insult to their own care of the children. So Grandma shrank into herself as much as she could, and let the boys have their way uncomplaining. That night Grandma Jackson dreamed of the little house. It was furnished with her own things, and she was living in it quietly, happily. Her children and their children and grandchildren came to see her and she was glad to have them because, in her own house, she could gently but firmly keep them in their places. She awoke and lay staring into the dark, and the longing for the little gray house became so acute it was a physical aching. But it was useless. There was no way to relieve the ache. If she had only saved a little money! But how could she, with four children to rear and educate? They had all had such good minds ?such great possibilities. She had scrimped and saved, and then spent freely to send them to college, to get them established in their chosen fields. She sighed and turned over and determined to sleep. What couldn't be cured must be endured, she knew from past years of wanting and going without. But she couldn't keep back the tears that squeezed under the soft wrinkled lids with their thin gray lashes; she couldn't stop the ache that tortured her old, tired heart. THE next afternoon Grandma Jackson put on her straw bonnet and took her knitting bag and said, almost too casually, \"Well, Clara, it's such a nice day, I think I?ll take a little walk.\" Clara looked at her mother-in-law, surprised. \"Why don't you wait till it's cooler?\" she shouted, and Grandma Jackson shuddered involuntarily. Clara always yelled at her in the belief that she was deaf, and Grandma's quiet assurances to the contrary had no effect. \"I'll just walk down the shady side of the street,\" Grandma protested. \"But you may get a sunstroke!\" Clara fussed. \"Lots of old people do, walking in the sun.\" \"I'll keep in the shade,\" Grandma repeated, determined not to be talked out of her little excursion. \"Well,\" Clara was openly doubtful. \"Don't go too far, I'll be worried till you get back. I'll be watching out for you.\" \"No, don't Clara,\" Grandma begged. \"If I get a wee bit tired, I'll stop in at Anabelle Truman's. She's been begging me to come, and I'm taking my knitting along.\" Grandma saw the triumphant look that leaped into Clara's eyes, and smiled secretly. Clara thought she had slyly found out where Grandma was going. She smiled sweetly at the old woman now. \"Be careful crossing the streets,\" she shouted, and Grandma escaped into the afternoon sun. She walked demurely enough down the street toward her old friend's house, and right on past. She turned the corner and hurried along, straight to the little side street, straight to the rickety gate halfway down the block. There Grandma Jackson stopped and waved greeting to the little lonesome house. It was just as she had remembered it! It hadn't been a dream. Grandma pushed open the gate and walked up the path to the porch. She sat down on the low step, took off her hat, and laid her knitting bag beside her. When Grandma Jackson realized she was thirsty, she remembered the little spring, and went around the house to the back. There was noth-ink to drink from, so she knelt on the grass and scooped up the cold water in her wrinkled old hands and drank it lovingly, gratefully. She was suddenly young again, with young William laughing beside her. She got up carefully and went to the back stoop and sat there, thinking of William and of their children. Suddenly, Grandma Jackson realized that when she thought of her children she never thought of them as they were now?grown men and women with children of their own. She thought of them as babies at her breast, as little folks starting off to school, as youngsters with problems of their own they brought to her, even as laughing soldiers going off to the last war?but never as middle-aged individuals ? never as married folk. Somehow, she had to admit to herself, they didn't seem much like her children any more. She wished that she had been able to keep one of them, at least, hers. Then she shook her head impatiently, she didn't wish any such thing. At last. Grandma got up with a sigh, went around to the front and, picking up her hat and knitting bag, she started home again. That was the first of her secret visits to the little house. As the days passed and the delight of spring grew into the reality of summer. Grandma's little afternoon walk became such a habit that Clara forgot to wonder and to ask questions. She had evidently talked it over with Will and Lettie, and they'd made up their minds to let her alone in her queer vagary. All old folks had some strange ways, and this was harmless. Grandma Jackson was glad for this acquiescence, and she took every advantage of their apparent indifference. First, it was Will's pruning shears. She had noticed that the currant bushes would have to be trimmed back, so she slipped the shears into her knitting bag one day, and when she got to the little house, she hurried around to the back yard and set to work. The pruning done, the uncouth state of the strawberry bed cried aloud for correction, so the next afternoon, Grandma Jackson pulled strawberry suckers till her hands were sore and her legs trembled, and her back ached, but she was happier than she had been for years. Bit by bit, the back yard took on a more civilized air, and the bushes and vines, as if grateful for attention, sent out showers of fragrant blossoms. The old lilac tree was so burdened that Grandma picked an armful of the lovely flowers, and then, not knowing how to explain them at home, she looked about for some way of keeping them here. She put them in an old bucket and set them inside the door, and the next day she went out of her way to go to the five-and-ten cent store to get a crock to put the blossoms in. In the store, she saw a tiny teakettle THE LONESOME HOUSE 171 and she suddenly thought how nice it would be to have a cup of postum of an afternoon when she had finished her work. So she bought the teakettle and some postum and wafers. TT was by easy stages like this, that Grandma Jackson moved into the empty house. At first, she sat on an old box, but one day Claude tucked a little check into his letter? a thing he frequently did?and Grandma bought a tiny second-hand rocker, and had it delivered, giving the man explict directions to put it in the back yard, as she wouldn't be there 'with her other things\" for a day or two. And once the rocking chair was placed between the two windows, it would have taken more resolution than Grandma possessed to convince herself that she was trespassing, or that she had no right to these harmless afternoons. AT home, Lettie and Will and Clara mentioned how much happier Grandma looked. Will said, \"Well, Grandma, I guess those afternoon walks of yours are just what you need. Maybe we've kept you too cooped up. You look better than you have in all the years since father died.\" Nobody bothered Grandma in her little house. No one ever came to the door or gave any sign of being interested in what went on there. That is until one afternoon, when the woman who lived next door, whom Grandma had sometimes seen in her little yard hanging out clothes or playing with her three children, came dashing over, her hair all tumbled, her eyes frantic. She pounded on the back door and Grandma Jackson opened it fearfully. Seeing the frightened creature before her, Grandma Jackson wanted to say \"Come in! Tell me what's wrong!\" but she couldn't do that, so she stepped out onto the little porch, pulled the kitchen door shut behind her, and asked, \"What's the matter?\" \"My baby!\" the woman gasped. \"Something has happened to her. Can't you hear her screaming? I don't know what's the matter! I can't get a doctor? someone's on the line and won't let me have it. I'm frantic?\" Grandma Jackson didn't wait to hear any more. She hurried along, her little old legs taking her through a gap in the fence, past the frightened mother. Yes, she could hear the baby screaming, the particularly anguished cries that accompany severe and unidentified agony. Grandma Jackson picked the child up and held her a moment, watching her carefully. Then the wrinkled, experienced fingers began to feel carefully over the little legs and body and arms. As the gentle pressure reached the child's face and ear, the screams became more piercing, and the child shrank under the soft touch. Her two little brothers, watching, frightened, began to cry. \"It's her ear,\" Grandma Jackson said. \"Has she put something in her ear?\" \"She couldn't!\" cried the mother, \"she hasn't had anything small enough!\" Grandma Jackson looked at the two little boys, but the mother flung her arm around them. \"Not them, either!\" she cried. \"Baby was lying on her quilt in her play pen on the lawn. They couldn't have reached her.\"\n\"It's an ant then,\" said Grandma. \"Get me some warm oil and a warm linen rag.\"\nWhile the mother was getting the materials, Grandma soothed the baby, then she laid her on her left side and very carefully poured the warm oil into the tiny ear. She laid the warm linen against it and fanned the child over on her right side.\nGradually the sobs began to moderate, and in a very short while the exhausted baby slept against Grandma's lap, with only an occasional sob to remind them of what she had been through.\nGrandma removed the linen and held it toward the mother. On it lay a black ant, drugged by the oil.\nWhen Grandma Jackson laid the baby gently in her crib and took the small boys' hands to tiptoe with them from the room, the mother said, \"I don't know how I can thank you, Mrs.?\"\n\"Jackson,\" said Grandma. \"Mrs. Jackson,\" she repeated, the phrase pleasing her with its recognition of her as something besides a grandmother.\n\"It must have been terribly painful. Won't you have a glass of cool lemonade before you leave?\"\nSo Grandma Jackson sat down and drank lemonade with her neighbor.\n\"You don't know how glad I am that you're my neighbor,\" Mrs. Cook said, sincerely, after they had introduced themselves. \"I am so dumb with the children. When anything happens I go all to pieces. I'm sure I came over to welcome you before,\" she explained, a little ashamed that she had not met this kind old woman until necessity demanded it, \"but you are there so seldom?\". She hesitated and flushed, and Grandma Jackson knew that this little woman must have peered through the windows, must have seen the barren rooms.\n\"Well, you see,\" Grandma began honestly, not caring to hide the facts from these sympathetic ears, \"I'm not there much. Just an hour or two in the afternoons. You see?\" and she went on to tell her new friend how she had found the house, how she had fallen in love with it, how she had finally moved in.\nMrs. Cook listened understandingly, but when Grandma had finished, she asked, \"Why don't you tell your children? I'll bet if they knew, if they understood how you feel, they'd be glad to get it for you. I know I'd want my mother to have anything?if only she were alive!\"\nGrandma Jackson patted her neighbor's hand.\n\"Yes,\" she agreed. \"I suppose they would. But it is silly, my having a whole house, when Will has an extra room. And I have no way of keeping in?light and coal and food and everything. We sort of talked it over when William died, the children and I, and we decided it would be smarter for me to stay at Will's and help Clara with the children. They were younger then, you know, and I could help a lot and stay with them at night when Will and Clara wanted to go out. And then, it isn't far to Lettie's, and I can run over and help her. I'd rather live with Lettie,\" she added wistfully, \"but?\" \"Well,\" Mrs. Cook comforted, THE LONESOME HOUSE 173 \"you can probably enjoy the little house as long as you want to. We've lived here four years and have never seen anyone around the place. Oh, right at the first of the war boom/' she corrected, 'people looked at it. But it isn't modern, you know, and so run down, no one wanted it.\" Now that Grandma knew her neighbor, she could ask for nothing more. She was so happy that she sometimes awakened in the night, and lay trembling, fearful of losing the little house and all it stood for in her lonely days. Then Claude wrote, asking her to come to visit him for awhile. Grandma Jackson had always gone when her baby boy called, but this time she didn't want to go away. She shook her head and wrote to Claude, but said nothing to Will or Lettie. A more urgent invitation came, and Claude wrote to Will, too, to persuade his mother. There was no way to explain her reluctance at going away without revealing her secret, so at last, under Will's and Lettie's insistence, she packed and went. She stayed two weeks and wired Will, \"Will be home on the 8:15 P. M. Tuesday.\" TAILL was at the station to meet her. He seemed more jovial than before, really happy to have her back again, she thought. He took her to the house, asking questions about Claude and Helen and the boys, all three of whom were in service. Clara and the children also seemed extra glad to see Grandma again, and she thought, \"Maybe they do like to have me here. Maybe it's a good thing to go away, so they can miss me once in a while.\" But when she went upstairs to take off her things, she stood still inside the door to her room, her heart shaken, her lips trembling like a lost child's. And she knew, then, why they had insisted on her going away. Clara had had a chance to do over Grandma's room. She had got rid of the ugly wooden bed she hated, and the old highboy, and the room was bright and streamlined and modern. A narrow, hard little bed stood where the big bed had been. Her old patchwork quilt, even, was gone! In a few minutes. Grandma took off her hat and coat very quietly, and hung them in the closet. She went downstairs and joined the family, not saying a word. They seemed strangers to her now, rather cruel strangers, and their titillating joviality was not deep enough to hide the nervous shame they felt at tricking her. At last Will could stand it no longer. He said, \"I guess you noticed that Clara's redone your room, Grandma?\" he asked tentatively. Grandma nodded. She couldn't speak. \"You'll like it better, once you get used to it. Did you notice we put in a little bathroom, all your own? He was too enthusiastic, and Grandma said, wishing to ease his embarassment, \"Yes, it's very nice.\" She wouldn't let them know?oh, she would never let them know-but if her little house was gone, too, how could she bear it? She saw Will's pitying glance as she went up to bed. She walked slowly, she knew, though she tried to straighten the bent shoulders. And, once in the hard, narrow bed, she buried her tired old head in her arms and wept. All the next morning, Grandma kept her eyes on the cloek. She could hardly eat, could hardly talk, waiting for the time to come when she could slip away and see what had happened to her little house. As soon as she decently could, she said, \"Guess Til take a little walk, Clara,\" and left before anyone could interfere. Grandma Jackson nearly ran all the way to the house. She was possessed of a strange feeling she couldn't define, and she was dreadfully afraid. But it was still there, gray and withdrawn and lonely, as she had left it. She paused at the gate long enough to wave a greeting, to let the house know she was back, and then she went up the walk and opened the door. For the second time within a few hours she stopped still and stared about her. There it was, just as she had dreamed it would be, with her rocker between the two windows, a round crocheted rug in front of it, even a fat gray cat, that rose and stretched and came and rubbed against Grandma's legs. Her old, pedal sewing machine that Clara had persuaded her to sell, was under a window, piled high with fluffy white curtaining. When Grandma got her breath, she walked cautiously across the floor and peered into the bedroom, and there was her old bed with its patchwork quilt, her highboy, with William's picture in its funny frame on top of it. It was all she could do to get into the kitchen, and to stare at the little stove, shining and black now, and the row of new small kettles in the cupboard sparkling with yellow paint, exactly like her very first kitchen. Grandma sank down in the little rush-bottomed chair beside the oldfashioned sink, and the tears ran down her face. She wasted no time thinking she had blundered into someone else's house?this was hers ? every bit of it. But how it had come to be she had no idea. She was still sitting there when she heard knocking on the door, and she went slowly to open it, her heart pounding, thinking that maybe, after all, she had been mistaken, or dreaming, or crazy. Will and Clara and Lettie and Lettie's little girl, Rhoda, stood there, beaming and laughing. \"How do you do, Mrs. Jackson,\" Will boomed, the noise in his voice and the laughter in his eyes trying to cover up the love and tears that threatened him. \"Won't you invite us in, Mother?\" Lettie's arms were about her. \"Were you surprised. Mother? We were almost scared to do it, but oh. We wanted so for you to have it, and we were afraid you would object?\" \"It is rather foolish?,\" Grandma made her lips say, but Will shook her tenderly. \"Not at all. Don't worry about that room at our place. We can find some war worker to rent it to. And as for keeping the place up,\" he smiled deep into her eyes, \"don't pretend you don't know about allowances! You understood them well enough when we went to school. And now you're going to have a dose of your own good medicine!\"\nAs they talked it all came out, how they had become suspicious of her daily walks and had followed her, how Claude had talked to Mrs. Cook and how Claude had been worked in on their scheme.\nAfter they left Grandma set about getting her first real supper in years. Her hands trembled as she lit the fire and filled the teakettle. She set the table and stood looking at it in the light of the friendly little kerosene lamp, when Mrs. Cook came to the door.\n\"May I come in, Mrs. Jackson?\" she asked, \"and formally welcome you as my neighbor?\"\nGrandma Jackson pulled forward the little chair and Mrs. Cook sank into it. The old woman noticed\nthat her neighbor's cheeks were pale, her lips pinched with weariness.\n\"Are the children in bed?\" she asked, and as Mrs. Cook nodded she urged, \"stay and have a bite of supper with me, then, you look a mite peaked.\"\nThe younger woman leaned back, wearily.\n\"I am tired,\" she said. \"The children have been little terrors today. Sometimes,\" she said softly, \"I hardly think I can ever go through it again.\"\nGrandma Jackson smiled understandingly.\n\"Children are a chore,\" she agreed as she served the food, \"and at times you can hardly see how they're worth it. But they are, my dear. They are.\""

            "content": "Rehabilitation of Disabled Soldiers and Sailors Excerpts from a Report, Office of War Information THE readjustment and happiness of wounded soldiers and sailors with compassionate physical disfigurements or disabilities or nervous manifestations will depend in large measure on the way their families and friends and the public at large behave toward them.\nThanks to modern therapy, many of the men suffering from even the severest wounds will be rehabilitated and enabled to lead lives of normal activity, engaging in industry, business or professions. But the most modern medical and psychiatric care, the finest surgery and appliance, expert rehabilitation, vocational training and employment opportunities are far from being all that is needed by the men who have suffered disfigurements and disabilities. The OWI passes along a number of suggestions, made by the Surgeon General of the Army, concerning everyday behavior on the part of friends, family and acquaintances most calculated to lessen the inevitable difficulties of adjustment of disfigured and disabled veterans.\nIf a formerly able-bodied man returns from combat with a disfigurement or other serious disability, he is almost certain to be emotionally disturbed. In other cases the wound he brings back may be mental.\nIn case after case, maimed young men have been freed from their black thoughts and bitterness, and have had their self-confidence restored, by the professional?expert and difficult?rehabilitation treatment they have received, as soon as possible after injury, in Army and Navy hospitals and in the hospitals of the Veterans' Administration. Disabled merchant seamen are cared for in United States Public Health Service Marine Hospitals.\nIn all these institutions, the restoration of self-confidence, as an aid in the restoration of physical health, is the immediate aim of doctors, nurses, and other personnel.\nDetails of accomplishments in the field of physical rehabilitation are becoming increasingly familiar to American readers of newspapers and magazines. Injured muscles are brought back into play, new or unused muscles are trained. When necessary, efficient surgical appliances are carefully fitted to replace amputated hands, feet or limbs.\nNervous disabilities resulting from combat experience are treated with equal care. In some cases prolonged psychiatric treatment is necessary; occupational therapy cures others rapidly.\nWhen he has recovered his physical or psychic health and is discharged from the Army or Navy hospital, the serviceman in need of vocational training is eligible to receive it from the Veterans' Administration if he has suffered a ten percent or greater disability, resulting in a vocational handicap, while in service.\nPage 176 REHABILITATION OF DISABLED SOLDIERS AND SAILORS 177 If not, the same training is open to him through the Vocational Rehabihtation Division of the United States Office of Education. Vocational training in the Veterans* Administration and other institutions is directed toward preparing the wounded man not only to fill a job in which his wound will not be a handicap, but to do important work which he will enjoy and for which he is temperamentally suited. In all cases, even those capable only of self-employment at home, the goal is useful, functional, independent living?not dependent, permanent residence in hospitals. After vocational training comes employment, and here many agencies are working for the wounded serviceman. In summary, Americans can rest assured that their wounded soldiers and sailors are being given the most modem medical and psychiatric care, the finest surgery and appliances, expert rehabilitation, vocational training and finally employment opportunities that confirm their hard-won feelings of independence. All these things are being provided, and provided by persons and organizations expert in their field, professionally equipped to further the welfare of wounded ex-servicemen. BUT the American people?the families, friends and acquaintances of the disabled and disfigured men, and the public at large?have a responsibility in the matter, too. It is up to them to further the men's progress during rehabilitation by considerate and cooperative behavior. Men who are working hard to acquire new self-confidence, or who have acquired it, must not be jolted out of it by thoughtless, uncontrolled manifestations of pity or horror or distaste or false cheeriness or too-eager curiosity or other emotionalism. For the purpose of increasing public awareness of some of the problems faced by disabled and disfigured men in their search for rehabilitation and normal living, and for the purpose of indicating to what extent public cooperation can be of benefit, the Surgeon General of the Army has set forth a series of guide-posts not only for the families and friends of such men, but for all who may come in contact vdth them. The suggestions are intended especially for the period of rehabilitation in hospitals or vocational training centers, but they also hold good for later, after the wounded men's return to civilian life: 1. Treat the maimed person as the normal person he always has been and continues to be. Disfigurement does not make him into a different person, though it may well result in his growing to be a bigger one. If you are disturbed by the disfigurement, discipline yourself so that your disturbance is not apparent. It is up to you to make him realize-without talking about it?that you feel about him exactly as always, and that his disfigurement is unimportant compared with your affection or friendship. The only difference could be an even increased respect for him. There is much to be gained from contact with a person who has suffered a handicap and overcome it. Such a person often gains extraordinary largeness of character from his fight and his success; and those around him, in turn, gain from his example. Treating disabled men as normal people is particularly important in cases of mental disability. Often, in cases of this kind, the average person retains ancient prejudices, and approaches a patient either with distaste or as though he were a child or a fool. It should be kept in mind that vast strides have been made in recent years in the treatment and rehabilitation of the mentally and nervously afflicted. They are simply ill?and their illnesses are usually curable. It should be emphasized also that excessive praise of a disabled man because of his disability is not helpful. 2. Don't ask questions or give advice. The man who has been disabled or disfigured may want to talk about himself or he may not. Respect his wishes. Do not mention the disfigurement unless he does. If he does not want to talk about himself, talk about things he is interested in, or about objects in the room, or hobbies, or details of common interest. Don't talk about the war or about subjects related to his injury. Don't pry or hint. The best answer to give a wounded man who asks you \"Am I going to be good for anything?\" is \"If you want to be good for something, determination helps.\" If you are related to a wounded or disfigured man, make it your business to know about the rehabilitation and accomplishments of persons as badly handicapped as he is, or more so, and be able to tell him about them ?not in a preachy way, but factually. Let him see that you know about them and that you assume he will take full advantage of his opportunities. 3. Be casual and lealistic?not over cheery. The man you are visiting may feel depressed. It is his right to feel so. It is an offense to his dignity and his common sense to go into a routine of transparent \"cheeriness.\" The express intent of cheering up is seldom convincing or effective. Nor is it usually convincing or beneficial to try to minimize the crippling effect of maiming. By facing the reality ofc a man's disability yourself, you can help him face it. Personal anxieties and problems of all kinds lose their capacity to frighten if they are brought out into the open, squarely faced and talked about. A disfigured man who finds his friends acting naturally and casually about his disfigurement will more easily avoid being the kind of person who goes through life shrinking if a child asks, ''What's the matter with that man?\" If a person has one leg, it is better to admit that fact and not try to conceal it. If one is deaf, the hearing aid should be worn openly, not treated as an embarrassing detail. A hearing aid or an artificial leg is just that and nothing more. The only difference it makes is that one hears or walks better with it than without it. 4. Don't wait on the injured man too much. Even though a disabled soldier or sailor be surrounded with sympathy, waited on hand and foot by nurses and given countless attentions, he may still despair. He may still view himself as a martyr-an attitude REHABILITATION OF DISABLED SOLDIERS AND SAILORS 179 which brings little happiness to him and no benefit to anybody else. If his faith in his ability to do things is restored the rest of the treatment is easy.\nIf there is something the patient can do for you, let him do it. Help-\ning others is an important part of rehabilitation. The families of men who have returned to their homes can greatly help them by letting it be seen that they expect self-reliance and cooperation, and by not being pessimistic or over-solicitous."

Griffin \"OUT there we talk of death quite calmly,\" said a young sailor, home on leave after seeing action in the South Pacific. \"We talk over what has happened to this one and that one of our friends. We never spare the details. We talk of death quite as matter-of-factly, as if we were discussing a newspaper item. We might as well. It's all around us out there, and we know it. I've seen more things than I can tell you.\"\nHe was much changed, this young man, from what he had been when he had gone away. Two years older? Yes, but more than that. His ordinarily fair-skinned face was bronzed from the rigors of sea life. But there were shadows across his brow, faint ones easily removed by his ready smile, but still lurking there in moments of repose. There was a firm new purpose to his jaw, as though, whatever his naval rank, he was master of himself no matter what the days might bring. And all this change because he had seen more things than tongue can tell. Physical suffering he had seen because he served with the medical corps. Death he had seen. Men dying before his very eyes. Men dying without a whimper, without a complaint.\n\"After one bombing we went about on deck helping the wounded. They were lying all about. I saw a fellow who had been my best friend lying over his gun. I thought he was dead, but when I came up to him he recognized me and he said: 'Do not move me for the others are\nabout done for.' But I had to do something for him. He was my friend. He died an instant later in my arms, and then I was glad, seeing his condition. This is something I will never forget as long as I live. Yes. Death is something we talk about quite openly. It's there and you have to face it.\"\nThat was the thing that made this boy different from what he had been before. He had been face to face with death. He knew he would go back to face it again, but in the meantime he would serve as best he could and smile all the while. While life lasted there were things to do for the living and last respects to the dead. Time enough to worry about danger when it struck. Two years ago he had been a young, care-free boy. Today he is a man, brave, master of himself and his emotions. And what has wrought the change? One thing. His ability to face reality, look it squarely in the eye, and spend his strength getting the most possible joy out of the real things of life, people, places, and comradeship.\nWhat are you doing, mothers of these boys who have become men overnight, who have seen more things than tongue can tell? What are you doing to change your own souls that would like to cringe and shrink into citadels strong and sure? What am I doing to prepare myself against the day when my sons must go forth to face the pains of life and death upon their own? How do we mean to face the problems of our own\nlives courageously? We believe we could endure the dangers our sons face more easily than to know that they, in whose veins flow our own blood, must suffer, endure, and perchance die. But if our task is great, we must be greater.\nI have seen mothers become whimpering old women, old long before their time, after their sons had sailed away to front-line action. I have seen them become helpless neurotics who can't stand to hear a news broadcast, who can't bear to read a paper. If it were helping these boys, then it would have purpose. But worry, anxiety cannot reach out and stop the bombs from falling. Instead, they twine like tentacles about the one who conceived them, crushing from her all the breath of life, like an octopus with its overpowering grip.\nAgain I have seen mothers, with heads erect, lock their secret heartaches into a dark corner of their beings, and valiantly go forth to take their parts in the many duties of life at home. Why the difference? Why does one cringe and one remain indomitable. The reason is simple, depending upon whether you fight with life or against it, whether you look the whole thing squarely in the face like the young seaman. It is whether you, too, know that death is there and will admit it, or whether you are trying to avoid it, to fight your own small futile fight, you know. Since Adam, men who have lived upon this earth have died. In that one thing all humanity are brothers. You know that each man must die, but don't push the knowledge back into a far corner of your heart and refuse to face it. Well, bring it out into the\nlight and let the sun shine upon it for awhile. You are going to die. Your son is going to die. No matter how you live, or grieve, or worry, you cannot change this fact. War doesn't make much difference then. It only makes you more aware that death stalks the earth.\nBUT you say: \"My boy is so young! What a pity a life is cut short in youth!\" So we always feel. A pity to die so young! But what does it matter if life be long or short? The important thing is, how have we lived and how have we died. The day to an honest man, busy with his constructive work, may seem all too short. The same day to a criminal waiting to pay for his crime upon the gallows may seem a fortunate eternity. But the day had twenty-four hours, and if it rained it rained for both. The difference is only in the human heart, in the way of life. One man knows the peace of honesty, the other the remorse, the despondency of a life which must pay for wasted deeds. Who, then, can measure a life, if it be long or short? Better to say it was rich or poor. Rich in valiance, in love, in honor, or poor in fear, in selfishness, in smallness of spirit. True it is, today many a youth gives his life, brief in years, but full of valor. \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"\n\"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.\" A strange thing? It has happened over and over in this world, but there has appeared with it the strange. It is something we have never felt before. It is a thrust to our courage. But we are not alone. Dogs that help? Every soul who has lived has had to face his Gethsemane, even the Son of Man. \"Forasmuch as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin.\"\nAs human beings we must suffer some things over which we have no control, sickness, financial reverses, death, but at least if we seek an honorable way to life we can spare ourselves many heartaches of our own making.\nThere are so many things to benefit humanity that need to be done. Your sons are doing a big part of them. There is much remaining for us to do at home. There will always be a need for worthwhile tasks, well done.\n\"And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\" And what person is it we should fear? None other than our own selves. True we must answer the call of death, for that is an event of life through which all must pass, but how we die and how we live\nthat is our own affair. We can chart a course which will steer us safely through troubled waters or we can let our souls crack up in the storm. It is for us to choose.\n\"And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.\" Hear the words of the Son of God who gave his life upon the cross to break the bonds of death, that the sea might one day give up the dead that are in it, that he might say unto the dry, parched, shattered bones of war, \"Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.\" The same Lord who said: \"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\"\nAs he leads let us follow, and while our days endure in the world we, too, can overcome the trials that beset our days, we can take up our cross and follow him. We can feel his peace which is so sweet no tongue can tell."

Work Meeting UTILITY APRONS IN most present-day households the homemaker finds it necessary not only to do her own housework, but to learn how to conserve her energy so she can accomplish all the tasks she desires to do. These aprons are practical in any kind of household but they are invaluable in homes where there are busy mothers and small children. The large pockets become convenient \"catch-alls\" for numerous articles which become misplaced. If the pockets are lined with oiled silk or a plasticized material they can also be used to carry a damp cloth for wiping off stray fingermarks, a cloth for furniture polishing, a whisk broom, etc. Such utility articles might be made on a Relief Society Work Meeting in the spring or for a coming bazaar. The apron (Illus. I) is very easily made using 3/5 yd. Of material 27\" wide for the apron proper, and 8\" of contrasting material for the pockets. The apron is most effective using a light color for the background and a very dark color for the pockets. The apron (Illus. 2) can be made in medium size using 21/8 yds. Of 35\" material. If a head bandana is made of the same material, a very smart effect is achieved in this utility costume. The apron ties and is also buttoned down the back. The large pockets end a little beyond the side seams. This apron is unusually effective if a bright gay, solid color is used. Bias tape in a contrasting color makes an easy finish to use for binding.

MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS (Continued from February Magazine) East Central States Mission THE following reports from four of the branches of this mission were received during 1944. Their Mission Relief Society President, Leone W. Doxey, submitted all but one. \"In the country district of Gretna, Virginia,\" wrote Sister Doxey, \"we have a Relief Society with sixteen members, thirteen of whom are not members of the Church. \"The meetings of tlie Gretna Relief Society are held Tuesday afternoons in the home of Sister Maria Rowland, 'Granny,' as she is lovingly called by all who know her. The home is a fine old Virginia farmhouse that had been the home of her husband's father and mother. Granny moved into it as a bride. She is now nearly eighty years old and has been a member of the Church for more than forty years. She teaches the theology lessons in Relief Society and is an inspiration to everyone there.\" Mrs. L. H. Snow, president of the Chadottesville (Virginia) Relief Society, wrote July 20, 1944: \"In and around this city and also other big towns, we see many beautiful little country churches closed for lack of preachers. Women from Page 184 some of these churches are joining the Relief Society and are glad to get something to do. I wish you could see our women working, making rugs, quilts, et cetera. The people in the country want to piece quilts so Iam taking them the material. I am also taking them samples of a miniature redchecked apron and a tiny pair of blue and white striped overalls, to help in the collection of contributions to the building fund. A note in the apron pocket has space for filling in the woman's name and her waist measurement, and carries the suggestion, \"A penny for every inch.\" A similar note in the overall pocket suggests that the men pledge either work on the chapel or a cash donation. We also have one member in Hampton, and she is making something for the bazaar in October. Some members up in the Blue Ridge near Standardsville are making quilts?one woman gave the top, filling, and bottom for a quilt last night. This project is getting every one doing something, and in that way they learn what we stand for and what we are doing in trying to teach the gospel. The people are hungry for the gospel and for friends.\" Sister Doxey reports an unusual Relief Society meeting held at Fairmont, Virginia, which came to her attention through Sister Crozier Kimball, a short-term missionary. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 185 RELIEF SOCIETY OF HARKERS ISLAND (NORTH CAROLINA), EAST CENTRAL STATES MISSION Picture submitted March 1944 by M. LA. President Raymond Guthrie who stated: This Society was organized in 1923 under adverse circumstances and almost unbearable persecution. Although at that time the membership was very small it has since grown, through the faith and charity exercised by the sisters, to the present membership of 30. Left to right, front row: Virgie Lewis, Annie B. Guthrie, Annie Rose, Annie Lee Lawrence, Edith Willis (Secretary), Gertie Willis (1st Counselor), Letha Lewis (President), Blanch Willis (2d Counselor), Lillian Davis (teacher), Belva Gillikin, Mamie Hamilton, Clara Willis and Edith A. Willis; second row: Nettie Brooks, Naomi Guthrie, Flora Belle Willis, Hannah Guthrie; third row: Glennie Guthrie, Mattie Whitley, Bessie Hancock, Nannie Willis and Hattie Rose. \"Sister May Sloter, Relief Society president in Fairmont, had announced on Sunday that the work meeting would be held the following Wednesday afternoon. The time arrived for the appointed meeting and no one came but the president. She felt discouraged and somewhat upset, but she had said there would be Relief Society meeting so she conducted one. She announced the song and sang it, opened the meeting with prayer, sang again and then sat down and quilted for an hour. At the end of the hour she sang another song and dismissed the meeting with prayer. She put her work away and returned to her home with joy and satisfaction in her heart. Sister Sloter is loved and respected by the members of the Fairmont Branch and though the membership is small, after this example of faithfulness, all who possibly can now attend the meetings.\" Northern California Mission MARY SMITH ELLSWORTH, recently released president of Relief Societies of the Northern California Mission, wrote last June: \"During the year thus far I have visited in every district with President Ellsworth. The most outstanding thing I find is the increased spirit of unity and cooperation and love among all our sisters. Our Relief Society meetings are held in most branches immediately following Sunday School; while the men Attend Priesthood meeting, the Relief Society and Primary convene. RELIEF SOCIETY MEMBERS.

Inset shows presidency with birthday cake, with President Lorena Humphries in center, and Counselors Mary K. Hirst and Mabel Kloss, left and right, respectively. Transportation facilities are more available on Sunday, especially in our outlying districts and where many of our people are engaged in war work. \"It is the earnest desire of President Ellsworth to establish a suitable place of meeting for every branch in this mission, and in this the sisters are doing their full part. This year two chapels have been dedicated and property has been purchased in eight branches. The sisters have given dinners not only for their own members, but, in several instances, have served for various clubs and groups who have paid them well. They have held rummage sales to dispose of clothes collected from neighbors and friends as well as our own members. Prior to the sales, these articles are washed or cleaned and mended; they bring in a very good price and help those who need them. High-type character balls and parties which included wholesome and amusing games have placed the sisters in touch with many, thus affording opportunity to teach the gospel by example as well as precept. \"We have in the mission, now, 260 local missionaries, many of them our Relief Society sisters. We feel thankful for this, for our younger mothers are gaining experience and knowledge that will qualify them to teach their children the gospel. We appreciate the excellent lessons given us by the General Board. They breathe the pure spirit of the gospel, impel us to action, and help to qualify us for real missionary work.\" Anna Duckett, secretary-treasurer of the Toyon (Redding, California) Branch Relief Society submitted last July the accompanying pictures and the following article by Eva S. Richards, a member: They Are Still Pioneers NOTES FROM THE FIELD 187 RELIEF SOCIETY SINGING MOTHERS OF SAVANNAH BRANCH (GEORGIA), SOUTHERN STATES MISSION Mission Relief Society President Effie Meeks says this is a splendid singing group which is a factor in maintaining interest in Relief Society work there. \"In the shadow of snow-capped Mt. Shasta lies a minute branch of the Church?the Toyon Branch. It is situated on the hills and bluffs overlooking the Sacramento River and Shasta Dam, the world's second largest concrete structure. \"The construction of this dam has brought people from all over the world, both as workers and visitors, and so the Toyon Branch is very cosmopolitan with representation from Canada, Australia, Germany, England, Sweden, Holland, as well as most of the states, from coast to coast. \"The dam is fifteen miles from the nearest California town of any size, and its construction brought five or six thousand persons, some of them Mormons, into a wilderness of red clay, turpentine pines, manzanita, and poison oak. \"Some of those who came early in the construction period spent that first miserable winter (three months of constant rain) in canvas tents; but spring comes early in this part of California and by April 1938, homes were started. Poison oak brush was plentiful and had to be cleared; even smoke from its burning carried contamination. Most of the work of clearing was done by women and children, for the work shifts on the dam changed every two weeks for some, while others worked a constant shift of day, swing or graveyard. \"The homes usually had their beginning as one-room affairs, but as the men earned steadily, the homes grew. Wells were dug in very unpromising terrain, with accidents, and even casualties, a common occurrence. MEMBERS OF THE NEWLY ORGANIZED RELIEF SOCIETY AT PLYMOUTH. MASSACHUSETTS standing in front of the National Monument to the Forefathers which overlooks the bay. Left to right: Kate Burgesis, Marjorie Pickett, Elder Harold Dance, Estella Hutchins, and Elizabeth Pickett, Relief Society president. The other members unable to be present when picture was taken are Cora E. Bartlett and Cora Ann Glass. Delightful homes with electricity and modern conveniences are seen in the once-wilderness. And now, six years later, \"The women worked long and hard to build these homes even though they knew they were to live there but a few years. Some of the women were sickly, some were old, some were having children, but they all had the desire for a home of their own. One family took the red clay, formed it into bricks, and, in one year, built for themselves a spacious six-room home that is now one of the social centers of the branch. \"Gardens were made in the red clay by the women and children who carried fertilizer and sand from the river banks. Much to everyone's amazement, the gardens produced. The daughters of the pioneers are still helping to make a garden spot in the West, and are seeing that their children are raised in the culture of home and Church. \"The Toyon Branch covers ten square miles. All of the visiting teachers are women who have families of small children, but their work has been done efficiently and on time. The loid anniversary of the organization of the Relief Society was observed March 17 by the Toyon Branch? Crystal candles, wild ferns, redbud and forsythia decorated the community house and an unforgettable program was presented. The war and the closing scenes at Shasta Dam are now sending this group on again to new fields, to new homes. They will carry their spirit of love and endeavor into new communities that have never heard of Mormons or witnessed their industry. \"Good luck to you all and Godspeed?modern pioneer women.\" New England Mission ELDER FOLEY C. RICHARDS was auxiliary supervisor for the mission at the time he submitted the following account, last August: \"Again the Relief Society plays the pioneer role in New England, this time in the 'Pilgrim Town,' Plymouth, Massachusetts, where America's forefathers settled three hundred and twenty-four years ago. \"On May 23, 1944, a Relief Society was organized there?the first organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be established in Plymouth. Under the direction of President William H. Reeder, Jr., Bertha S. Reeder, mission Relief Society president, and Elder Ted L. Miller, district president, this Society was organized with six members. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 189 FOUR RELIEF SOCIETIES OF THE WESTERN STATES MISSION (Pictures submitted by Luceal R. Curtis, recently released president of the Relief Societies of this mission.) Top row, left to right: Relief Society at Salida, Colorado; Relief Society at Fruita, Colorado, observes the 102d anniversary. Bottom row, left to right: Belle Fourche (South Dakota) Branch also celebrates 102d anniversary of Relief Society; Relief Society at Grand Junction, Colorado. Three of these were Latter-day Saints at the time; one has subsequently been baptized, and the other two are earnest investigators of the gospel. All are the fruits of recent missionary labor. 'These good sisters are enthusiastically meeting together each week, and the future of their group is promising indeed. Each has had to face the usual criticism which attends one who is willing to subscribe to 'Mormon' beliefs, and the Church can be justly proud of them for their Pilgrim spirit of loyalty to their convictions and for their service which makes possible this Latter-day Saint organization in New England's oldest town.\" Lola Humphreys, writing in the fall of 1944 as auxiliary supervisor, reported the successful Relief Society convention held September 2', at Cambridge, Massachusetts (the mission headquarters) for Relief Society officers. She continues: 'The careful planning which took place several weeks in advance, contributed greatly to the success of the conference which was very well attended by approximately 75 Relief Society officers. \"During the forenoon session, a detailed and instructive outline of the duties of the officers was given by Mission Relief Society President Bertha S. Reeder. The remaining time was spent in the bearing of testimonies. At noon, a delicious buffet luncheon was served in one of the rooms of the Cambridge chapel from a table very attractively arranged with candles and flowers. In the afternoon, several talks were given in the homes of different Relief Society branches, and the Singing Mothers of Hartford, Connecticut, offered three beautiful numbers, at intervals.\n\"The enthusiasm and zeal with which Sister Reeder discussed the problems and with which she delivered her remarks were transferred to every one present. In spite of the fact that some of the members had had travel much more capable of carrying home the day before, they all felt much more capable of carrying on their duties after the convention.\"\nA comprehensive mimeographed bulletin was distributed, carrying a concise and explicit digest of duties of officers and of new instructions, and also a narrative history of the several local Relief Societies in the mission for 1943-44, indicating the problems, activities, and accomplishments of each.\nHawaiian Mission\nOLIVIA S. Waddoups, former Relief Society president of this mission, wrote in March 1944: \"Brother Waddoups is superintendent of the Leper-asylum here at Kalaupapa. We find a wide field for service to these people who, though entirely confined for life within this area of about 12 square miles, are very happy, cheerful, and contented. They are also very war conscious, buying bonds and stamps to the extent of three times their quota. They are well taken care of by the Territory. We have a very modern hospital, two capable doctors whose wives are nurses in the hospital, five other nurses; 12 Catholic Sisters who manage the hospital, five other nuns; two Catholic priests; one Congregational minister, his wife and three members of his family; the plantation manager and planter; and the general manager for the United States Public Health Service; the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church; four Brothers who are in charge of the Leper Home for Men; the Catholic, with Reverend Alice, a real Hawaiian lady, to look after her congregation; and our L.D.S. Church. The Elders visit us monthly, and we have a patient here who is the Presiding Elder. We have the smallest congregation but our members are very active and interested.\n\"The Relief Society sisters who are well enough to get out are very active. Last Sunday we held an anniversary meeting commemorating March 17. We all came dressed in white; there were 9 of us, and 12 young girls and 16 of the Priesthood. I am sure this was the most unique anniversary meeting in the Church. All but two of us are victims of the disease?myself and Sister Kalahau, a very little one, but we try to keep who is blind but who leads the group in their singing. In the group that furnished the singing there were four blind, two on crutches, and others who needed help to get around. But they sang beautifully, and bore testimony that the Lord was good, and kind, and that they were very grateful for the Relief Society organization.\n\"All in all, we have a little world, a very little one, but we try to keep happy, busy and helpful. We take every precaution possible. We have several people here who have been here over 40 and one 53 years, working with the patients in every way, in the hospital, dressing their wounds, bathing them, and giving (Continued on page 192)"

Laughter and friends. I Remember? Elder Rodney B. Taylor \n\nCorrected OCR Transcription\nRECENTLY while attending a reception in a Utah community, the discussion of the Women's Clubs came up. It seemed that most of the matrons present belonged to at least one club and some to more than one. These women were sort of the town's \"four hundred,\" and spent considerable time discussing the merits and demerits of their respective clubs. Previously, a member of one had referred to another club as the \"tea drinkers' club.\"\nThis sort of split the community wide open, and at this gathering the crack had not entirely closed. These women were considered good Latter day Saints, and I wondered why more of them did not give vent to their energies through the Relief Society, my pet organization of the Church. They seemed to crave excitement or glamour and to consider the Relief Society a little, should I say, too sedate for them.\nIn reading our Church history, one is particularly impressed by the number of doleful, mournful experiences our people passed through, leaving one to wonder if they ever had any pleasure or joy?and so with Relief Society. I don't believe the Society puts its \"best foot forward.\" Let me tell you about one of the times when it entertained Nobility, and said, 'Let there be a feast,' and there was a feast.\"\nWhile I don't profess to remember way back when knighthood was\nrecall the tail end of the Gay Nineties. Much has been written about the American way of life during this time, but, as Mormons, I suppose we were so busy cutting sagebrush, digging ditches and killing the snakes, that there was not anything very gay about it for us. However, this was not the case up in a little Mormon community in Canada. I'll never forget mother trying to dress up to look like a Gibson Girl!\nWe had only been up there a few, short years, and had succeeded in establishing an outpost of civilization; it was just a year or two before the turn of the century.\nMost of the saints made this eight-hundred-mile trek by wagon train in quest of land. A few were called by the Church to colonize this prairie, and, rather hurriedly, others joined them.\nFor those who came in quest of land their every wish was satisfied. The prairie spread out for hundreds of miles with not a fence in sight. It was all covered with luxuriant wild hay. Why the grass grew so high that I, as a boy, couldn't find a bare spot on which to play marbles. Prowled up, this land would produce sixty bushels of wheat per acre; however some years we would have a drought, wouldn't raise anything. Most of us, coming from Utah, were irrigation-minded, and so we set about digging a canal and making an irrigation system. Nowadays we get the money from Government and call it a project; but in those days we had to do it ourselves, and we didn't have much with which to do it. Page 208 I REMEMBER 209 It was the first irrigation system in Canada, and caused favorable comments for us, as a people, throughout the country. This was indeed welcome as we had been followed by much ugly rumor from Utah.\nShortly after the completion of the canal, the bishopric received a letter saying that a person of noble lineage, who was also a very high Government official (actually a real English Lord) had condescended to pay us a visit ostensibly to inspect the canal, however we had a pretty good idea that we, as a people, would be scrutinized. At any rate, we were indeed thrilled at the thought of entertaining His Lordship.\nOf course every privilege has its responsibilities. There was the problem of entertaining His Lordship which was brought very vividly to our attention by a little English doctor, recently from England, and who was about the only gentleman in our midst. While the saints bragged of having an M.D., it sort of had a hollow ring to us. It seems in those days, when an English boy graduated from a medical school, he invariably went to the colonies to \"practice\" on the colonials for a couple of years before returning to England to establish his profession. We knew we served more or less as guinea pigs to him, but we also knew that he was better than no doctor at all.\nUpon hearing of His Lordship's intended visit, the little doctor was more or less terrified at the thought of us entertaining him. He knew only too well that our facilities for such an occasion were somewhat limited.\nThere were about fifty houses in the town, some of them being sod. There were also three business houses, a little general store, a blacksmith shop and?you would never guess the other so I'll tell you?a millinery shop! My father ran the general store; he used to advertise everything from candles to coffins but there wasn't much in the store. He used to make the coffins \"on order\" and I used to dread hearing of someone dying of pneumonia or being drowned to death by a horse, because it meant an all-night vigil for me, holding a light by which father might see to build the coffin. He had learned the carpenter trade working on the Manti Temple before going to Canada, so bending and gluing boards, lining them with white satin inside, and white figured plush outside, and mounting the silver handles seemed to be no effort for him. But as for me, I'd get sleepy and let the light fall over, and sometimes the chimney would fall off and smash on the floor?not only that, but the next day I'd be so sleepy I could not go to the funeral. The funeral was something not to be missed in a country where nothing ever happened except snow, wind, wheat blizzards and more wind. Among the bishopric they owned a pair of beautiful black percheron stallions imported from France. In the event of a funeral, they would be hitched together to draw the hearse. It was an inspiring sight. Sometimes right in the procession they would get in a fight, but several sharp cracks of the bishop's whip would fix them. It was a sight not to be missed by any boy.\nAnd now for the millinery store. It seems the sisters could put up with sod houses, wind, snow, and mud, but they must have their hats. In those days a hat really meant something. A man's standing in the community might be judged by the number and quality of the ostrich plumes in his wife's hat. So you see, hats were important. Hence the millinery shop on this outpost of civilization held a high place.\nMother used to keep her hat on the highest shelf in the house, totalling two or each of us youngsters. About twice a year she made a trip to the hat shop to have the artificial fruit updated, the moths killed in the ostrich feathers, and perhaps a little bunch of flowers added. After a few years of this the hat was indescribable. When mother would reach up and get that hat down, we youngsters knew something big was \"brewing,\" perhaps a long trip, a visit by a General Board member from Salt Lake City or, in this case, Nobility.\nAs the day for the reception drew near, the little doctor became a little more panicky. The millinery store became more a beehive of activity. The bishopric contented itself with writing the speech of welcome.\nThe speech of welcome, we considered a masterpiece. Nearly everyone in town having had a hand in writing it. It started out by saying how proud we were to be residents (not citizens) of Canada (most of us were homesick for Utah). Then it continued by telling His Lordship in a roundabout way what fine people we were, and ended by asking him for a telegraph line, a railroad, a bridge across the St. Mary's River, and a schoolhouse. It was deemed wise not to ask him for too much at one time.\nInasmuch as the doctor spoke very good \"Oxford English,\" it was decided he should read the speech of welcome. Not only that, but the doctor owned a pair of highstepping English hackneys coach horses, and a rubber-tired rig. It was a luxurious outfit to be sure. So it was decided to have the doctor and his wife represent the official welcoming committee.\nI might add that this pair of hackneys were fed from seed cold oats in slats in the roof of the hayloft. Their water was equally high, consequently their necks grew straight up. When traveling their heads were very much erect. Should they have been turned out to pasture they would have starved, as they couldn't get their heads down to the level of the grass. I suspect the little doctor of importing these horses to impress upon us that, after all, we were just \"colonials.\"\nNevertheless, I, as a boy, tried checking up the load of my deliveries to see if I could look like the doctor's horses but I didn't accomplish much. The first trip out he fell down and broke the shafts of my delivery wagon.\nThe bishopric in those days was our police department, fire department, judge, jury and all, rolled into one. They gave the orders and we followed them out as best we could. We knew that inasmuch as the bishopric had brought us through this far, they would have no trouble in entertaining an English Lord. The really hard part of the reception, that is the giving of the banquet, was turned over to the Relief Society. Mother used to say it seemed no that when a job became too big for the bishopric, they turned it over to the Relief Society sisters.\nThe next few days drifted rather quietly along. The sisters checked their respective silverware and table linens. The bishopric put the finishing touches on the speech of welcome. The doctor and his two hackneys clipped and groomed to a state of perfection. Then another letter came saying that not only was His Lordship coming, he would be accompanied by his two beautiful daughters. To the bishopric this just meant the setting of two more plates; however, Father Bill, to realize the repercussions the news would cause among the sisters.\nFrom reading English newspapers, the sisters knew full well the two ladies in question. They were the \"toast of the Empire\" and had been entertained extensively in the stately halls of Europe?Paris, Vienna?and other parts of the world. And further, the sisters felt that they would be met and would not face them in their present wardrobes, shabby from the trip to Canada.\nAfter considerable tumult, meager savings were dug up, livestock sold, and a messenger was dispatched posthaste to the nearest city to replenish our stocks of apparel. The millinery shakes were long since bare.\nDressing up mother in those days was some job. Nearly every member of the family would help. There was the matter of the skirt, a much pleated, folded, voluminous affair of many layers. Mother, being the wife of the Store Owner who was also a High Councilman, had to dress like part. In this case she had gained a few pounds, and waist lines were supposed to be very small. We fit her to the dress, which was a simple matter. She meekly went without her dinner and then, by holding her breath and wiggling a few times while father drew the corset strings taut, we got her down to a size where she could get into her dress and the \"Gibson Girl\" effect. But some of the sisters required a complete new outfit.\nFor the few days before the big event, the town was a bedlam of activity. But the day before His Lordship's arrival found everything in readiness. Table linens all pressed, silverware highly polished, and wardrobes in tiptop shape. The place of meeting was the only large house in town, and, by opening some doors, two rooms could be made into one.\nAfter the banquet, the plans called, for the townspeople to drop by in twos and threes to meet the party. After which, the doctor would drive them and the bishopric on an inspection tour of the canal. At long last, we were ready.\nEarly the next morning, the sisters could be seen converging on the reception house from all directions, carrying food, silverware, linen, flowers, dishes, and even furniture! It looked like a gala day except for the fact that a strong north wind had sprung up, which immediately was followed by a thunderous downpour of rain.\nThe rain being very flat, soon there were floods, and after a couple of hours of this deluge, the countryside took on the aspects of the Pacific Ocean. Every few blocks in this prairie were buffalo wallows, and, when wet, they were bottomless pits for a carriage. We began to realize that all our plans and preparations were all for naught if it did not stop raining, when up drew a carriage bearing some Church officials, members of a General Board from Utah. This sort of complicated things for the sisters, but at least if the rain did not abate, there would be someone to eat up this feast. Needless to say these Church officials were very pleasantly surprised, if not awestruck, when they came in and beheld this banquet room resplendent with gleaming white linen, highly polished silverware, the most delicate and lovely chinaware decorated with wild flowers, and at the end of the table a beautiful red plush chair standing. It was sort of a sentinel for all that was grand. I never knew that such things existed. Needless to say being a boy I was not privileged to try it out. Some sister evidently had smuggled that chair through from Salt Lake in the back of a covered wagon, perhaps unknown to her husband. Now here it stood in all its glory surrounded by a wilderness, waiting the touch of Nobility. As the morning drew on, the storm grew in intensity and assumed proportions of a cloudburst, and we began to realize that our chances of shaking the hand of Nobility were very slim indeed. By noon, the skies seemed to split wide open, the rain fell in sheets and the whole countryside was swimming. Luckily, we had these Church officials with us, and in those days they were always hungry, so that all our efforts wouldn't be wasted. Shortly after noon, we had several more terrific claps of thunder and the wind and rain continued. The bishopric went into a huddle with the Relief Society president. After all the dinner was ready to be served, it seemed the Relief Society, too, had a weakness for visiting General Board members, and Nobility or no Nobility, the dinner was served. Occupying the brilliant red plush chair in all his splendor was the bishop. He was flanked by his counselors, the Church officials, and a few prominent townspeople. Judging by the appetites of these visiting churchmen, they must have been on the road quite some time and perhaps traveling without purse or scrip. Eventually, the dinner was all eaten up, the sisters were congratulated on being such good cooks, after which the organ was rolled out and the brethren sang a few songs. However, having just partaken of such a sumptuous repast, they soon all settled down in chairs. The room echoed to their hymn \"All Is Well, All Is Well\" accompanied by the gentle patter of rain on the windows. The brethren were soon drowsy and some cat napping. It was a peaceful scene to behold indeed-\"All Is Well, All Is Well\" with the exception of one little lively girl of 'perhaps eight years with long spindly legs, who was upstairs, downstairs, hither, thither and yon all at the same time, followed by her two pigtails. I Remember 213 ON one of her numerous trips, she happened, by chance, to look out the window, and wheeled and screamed?\"The Lord is coming, he's coming, he's coming?and he is bringing the whole British Army with him.\"\nInstantly the whole house seemed to be electrified?British Army, British Army, the Lord?rain?mud?no dinner?these murmurs seemed to permeate the very atmosphere of the room. At this time His Lordship's appearance would be distracting enough, but a British Army besides, in fact any army, would be most unwelcome.\nThe saints swarmed to the windows, and sure enough coming across those golden, rain-soaked prairies, was a large body of horsemen. They were surely but slowly making their way straight for the house.\nOnly a few minutes previous, observing the bishop \"enthroned\" on that red plush chair, I had decided that when I grew up I wanted to be a bishop?but he was now a very distracted figure, which somewhat dampened my ardor?and the rest of the men looked as if their dinners had turned to lead.\nEventually, the party drew up on the front lawn?preceded by the little doctor bearing the speech of welcome, who took up his prearranged post on the porch.\nHis Lordship was thoroughly chilled and soaked and had to be pried out of the saddle, and he stomped into the house right past the doctor, speech of welcome and all.\nHis Lordship's beautiful daughters did not fare much better. He looked like two hens who had been out in the rain all night and were more to be pitied than envied.\nIt seemed that back at His Lordship's starting point that morning, Canadian officials had tried, in the face of such threatening weather, to prevail upon His Lordship not to attempt the trip, but he had merely shrugged his shoulders and inferred that the punctuality of the British Aristocracy was a thing not to be trifled with, and go he would, also his daughters.\nSince a carriage would probably have stalled, they were all mounted. In normal weather an honor guard of perhaps twelve Royal Canadian Mounted Police would have accompanied persons of such lineage, but in this case the guard was not only doubled but trebled. We were indeed relieved to learn that \"the whole British Army\" had turned out to be mostly \"Mounties\" whom we had learned to know as protectors. As a boy, when I used to see one coming in his scarlet red coat I thought of all the bad things I'd ever done.\nThe Indians around us were taught that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were the sons of the \"Great White Father\" (King of England) and if they displeased the Mounties, the \"Great White Father\" would wreak vengeance on their heads.\nAt this point, to use a military phrase, the Relief Society \"took over.\" They immediately discerned that what His Lordship and ladies needed most was to get warm and have their coats and other clothes dried. They went into a huddle, and after a few hurried whispers they would now go to work with clocklike precision. Several slipped out the back door and began catching, killing, and frying chicken as they have never done before or since. Youngsters were sent around town to spread the alarm that we were all caught \"flat footed.\" Other sisters set about drying His Lordship's tunic. Imagine the thrill the sisters in this outpost of civilization must have received in carefully untangling and drying the gold braid with which it was draped. One of the bishopric was dispatched posthaste to my father's store to see if, perchance, there was anything left in it after the previous dinner. He came in the store all excited and said, 'The Lord has come and there is not a bite in the house to eat! Have you anything?\" My father replied, \"Well I'm not surprised. I've been preaching for years if we were not more careful, the Savior would be dropping in on us and our lamps would be empty, and now this?\" They went over the store shelves and discovered seventeen cans of oysters. They were stocked in the store for such occasions as wedding receptions, visiting apostles, or, in this case. Nobility. They were so expensive it was considered next door to sacrilege to use them for anything else. The Mounties dismounted and we turned their horses, all fifty head, into the host's haystacks. At least they were going to be well fed. The sisters hurriedly summoned Brother Fofalite, an Italian convert, a very fine musician and our choir leader. It was common knowledge about the town that the bishopric was not any too well pleased with Brother Fofalite?it was thought that he had the choir spend too much time on operatic arias and neglected such good old hymns as \"Come, Come Ye Saints\" and \"High On the Mountain Tops.\" Nevertheless, Brother Fofalite was an expert musician, but in twenty years of farming, he was never known to raise a crop. The sisters soon had the banquet room again in order. With the splendor of the Mounties and their scarlet red uniforms, the atmosphere of the room took on a tone of brilliance. Eventually, His Lordship and Ladies regained their composure. Brother Fofalite appeared and accompanied on the organ a quartette of the sisters who sang, artistically, several difficult operatic renditions with which the Noble Party was very much surprised. Following this the town's \"Oomph Girl\" (yes, we had them in those days, too) sang a song in \"rag time\" which immensely pleased the Mounties, but evidently passed clear over His Lordship's head. By this time the rain having subsided, once more the sisters began converging on the banquet house from all parts of town, bringing even more dishes, furniture, and food. My admiration certainly went out to the Relief Society sisters, even though I knew full well we'd probably be on a mush and milk diet for the rest of the summer. The dinner was served in excellent style. The whole party was enthusiastically pleased with its reception \"at the hands of the Mormons.\" The storm lifted and they were shown the canal and sent happily on their way. Thus the Mormons in Canada were judged and came through with flying colors. Thanks to the Relief Society and all seventeen cans of oysters, the day was saved, and we all lived happily ever afterwards. Mysteriously, that red plush chair was never seen again from that day to this. THE EASTER GIFT Grace M. Candland Today The darkened earth is filled with guilt and gloom, Swift marching feet and screaming bomb and shell Obscure Christ's resurrection from the tomb. Men race to death through groaning sea and sky, And mourning fills the breaking hearts who tell Of youthful slain, and starving children's cry. The gift of life is but a myth today, Men's carnal minds rush on to living hell. The urns of faith have fallen to decay. Tomorrow Come, stand beside the Easter lily fair And look within its graceful waxen bell, The buried bulb has risen to beauty there. To know that from this darkness and the strife Beyond the reach of tears and sad farewell, There is the promise of immortal life. Eternal message, like a flag unfurled. Bright star of hope, no other can excel The Easter gift unto a dying world. Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, April 1, and April 15, 1885 \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations\" Editorial Notes: The General Conference of the Church will be held this year in Logan, instead of Salt Lake City. This is the second time only that the General Conference has not convened here. The other instance was in St. George in April 1877. Correspondence: Nutrioso, Arizona, Feb. 13, 1885, Editor Exponent ? Thinking perhaps a few words from far away might be interesting is why I write. We left St. George the last of June 1883, and after an agreeable visit to Panguitch Lake and various settlements we returned to St. George to the fall conference and soon after bade adieu to our much cherished home, and the Temple and its pleasant associations. We had a very prosperous journey of 500 miles through an indescribable wilderness of sterile barrenness, and came to this place in good health and spirits, although tired, worn and weary. We here found most of our family in peace, comfort and reasonably prosperous in the midst of the saints. This is a pleasant, fertile, but small, valley, truly in the tops of the mountains, with beautiful scenery of low hills and openings of timber for farms, with the necessary water, this being a rainy climate. We have here the best built and finest little town in Arizona; the dwellings of frame painted white, with good, substantial frame barns and outhouses; a cooperative store in healthy and prosperous condition. We have a good frame meeting house, also white, which is also our school house. Our meetings are well attended, also our day and Sunday schools, not forgetting the prosperous condition of our Primary and Relief Society. The Brown brothers have a steam saw mill in successful operation, to whose enterprise and energy much of the prosperity of this little town is to be credited. Yours respectfully, T. C. @ RRA Letter from a Gentile, Mrs. Wells: I take several papers, but none that I read with more interest than the Exponent. 1 am watching with great interest your people struggling for existence, surrounded by enemies as they are, and what the result will be I cannot yet tell; but my opinion is that riches and selfishness will be the greatest enemies your people will have to contend with. This was the great moral disease that Jesus Christ found in the world and prescribed for; and so long as your people follow His directions closely and attentively they will live and grow and prosper; but when riches, pride and selfishness grow up among you, then you will have only a form of godliness without its power, as the religious orders of this country, and the spirit of the world in all of them and the spirit of Christ not found in them.?John M. Russel. RELIEF SOCIETY REPORTS Fremont, Piute Co., Editor Exponent ?

She compensated by sculpturing as a hobby. Later as assistant to a famous plastic surgeon, she utilized both these anatomical and artistic skills in developing the best method known today of making artificial fingers, noses, hands and other \"prosthetic\" parts, even matching remarkably the shade of human skin (and there are two million shades of skin).

The milestone reached on March 17, 1945 reminds us that Relief Society women have been working, serving, and studying together for 103 years. Their organization which was founded by a prophet of God on a broad, liberal, and adequate foundation has enabled them to meet assignments, requirements, and needs as they have occurred during this long period of time. Their experiences in this great. Society, dedicated to service and education, have been manifold, varied, and stimulating. In their labors they have learned how to be helpful in overcoming the difficulties and hardships of daily life, how to be helpful in solving problems incident to migration and pioneering, and how to be helpful in the adjustments and readjustments confronting individuals, families, and society in this great century of changes and developments resulting from discoveries, inventions and new and different conditions. And because of these activities which have constantly required strength, foresight, and ingenuity, and bePage218 cause of the intelligent study put forth in regular class work, learning how best to live and improve and enrich life, great development has come to these earnest and able workers. Thus it is seen that the Relief Society with its two-fold program has brought unusual opportunity to the women of the Church who have partaken of its advantages?opportunity for human service and opportunity for spiritual, intellectual, and emotional development. Through human service there has been engendered in their hearts a love and sympathy for others, the spirit of the golden rule, and that respect for human personality which was taught and practiced by the Master himself. And through regular educational study and research the lives of all who participated have been enriched. Their motto has been \"The Glory of God Is Intelligence.\" To the women of the past we pay tribute. We are indebted to them for their vision, self-sacrificing efforts, and untiring labors. They have left us a rich heritage of faith and devotion to the Relief Society cause and to the restored gospel. Their testimonies of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and their lives of service to the Church have been an inspiration and strength to us. To our co-workers, we offer congratulations for their like devotion and fortitude and for their great accomplishments in these days of apprehension and anxiety; Our prayer is that the Lord will bless and sustain them. And to the new and vigorous young leaders and workers who are coming into the service we say, look backward as well as forward; strive to properly evaluate the past and use it as a foundation for the future; and look forward with faith and a long view. A. B. L. TO MY GRANDCHILDREN Maude Hatch Benedict When I am gone, will eager children look Within the pages of this timeworn book, Their questing eyes find nothing here to show Fulfilled ambition, finished task; will they know Pride?that I left footprints here below? Will all the little tasks of love be lost Forever, as a fluff of thistledown-No heartache, tears, frustration's cost. Nor valor shown, when I am gone-No thing of me to spur them to go on? Or will they say of me, \"she still belongs. Her life was made of sunshine and of songs, Where she walked some radiant memory Of charm, of wit, of kindliness in giving, The paths she trod made surer by her living!\" 4 Will they smile, a wee bit wistfully, While thumbing through this dog-eared old scrapbook- And for a moment will they pause to listen For my heartbeat in its pages; will they look Further, wishing to know more of me. And close the book?a tear left to my memory! Come in for Dessert Edna K. Ward THE homemaker today who must be hostess, cook, and maid is discovering many short cuts. Elaborate entertaining, and many-course, complicated meals went out with whipped cream and two-inch-thick steaks. Entertaining at all might require justification with so many homemakers working in war industries, busy in Red Cross canteens and sewing centers, serving as nurses' aids, and Gray Ladies. Returning home worn from the work of thee day, it requires courage to undertake the entertainment of our friends, and yet it is in times of stress that the companionship of the friends we see so seldom gives a lift to their morale and also to our own. If we can find a way to extend this courtesy with simplicity, consistent with rationing restrictions, we may foster the place of the home in the lives of our children and our friends. The trend of modern life in America has seemed to be away from the home and home interests. A dinner downtown or at some club, lunches and snacks at the drugstore for children as well as adults, has made the home mean less in the lives of many than it did in pioneer days. Home influence has decreased in direct proportion. No one has time for elaborate meals these days, but any meal should be worthy of the time you do give it. Badly planned meals are neither fun to prepare nor to eat; the food that appears daily on your table has to be Page 220 prepared by someone?and that someone must like what she is doing or the result will be far from satisfactory. For cooking is a peculiar occupation; to succeed, it must combine the best of both work and hobby. Only when cooking is viewed and approached as an art, which it is, is the burdensome repetition of the task turned into a self-gratifying performance. If you give it your heart and mind it can be as satisfying as painting pictures. Colorful china, linen, flowers from your garden are your \"brushes and oils.\" With them you can create a background that makes even the simplest meal more glamorous. Foods in themselves have their own natural beauty. It's mixing them up?the reds, greens, yellows and whites? that gives your meals the most appetizing effect. Though the first impression of the dining table is only momentary, like a landscape just before sunset, the real fun is in creating it, and that will last until you create another. And there's more involved in it than just the \"looks.\" Digestion depends upon the psychological reaction to our senses. Food that is well cooked and nicely served creates a healthful response in the attitude of the mind toward food. Emotional disturbances, fear, anger, anxiety, unrest banish appetite and stop the flow of the digestive juices. Happy influences, harmony, and beauty stimulate and promote these vital functions. COME IN FOR DESSERT TABLE SET FOR DESSERT And so in these busy times let's make home meals and company meals as simple and nutritious and beautiful as possible. To simplify home entertaining even more, it is possible to substitute a single course ?invite your friends for dessert. This touch of hospitality may be the occasion for a pleasant evening at home. It is hoped the suggestions given in this article may call forth original ideas that will be practical in the individual home. In planning an evening dessert, the invitation can be extended on short notice. A call on the telephone in the morning with the explanation that you are serving only dessert, and arranging an hour convenient to both hostess and guest, makes the occasion informal. The hour may be seven-thirty or eight o'clock. The planning must include the table setting and the menu, and perhaps the entertainment to follow. A small table may be set for four in the living room or the dining-room table may be used for a larger group. This is an invitation to use our choice pieces of china and silver ?the lovely compotes that mother prized or the chocolate pot that father brought from England or Germany when he returned from his mission. The table cover may be doilies or a luncheon cloth. The table mirror makes an attractive foundation for the display of a low centerpiece of ivy, leaf, berry, fruit or blossoms, each in season. Candles always add soft light to any evening meal. The service should be your nicest dessert plates or crystal sherbets with dessert spoons and forks. If hot chocolate or postum is used, the hostess may serve it at the table in either tea cups or after-dinner cups. The dessert also may be served by the host or hostess at the table. If one does not have help, to have everything on the table eliminates the confusion of someone leaving to bring things from the kitchen. Salted nuts are easily prepared at home and can be included, and homemade candy will always be appreciated. A few suggestive menus and recipes are given at the end of this article. A FTER lingering in the candle-light with good food and interesting conversation, the party may move to the living room and its cheery fire, or to the summer terrace. A planned evening might include discussion of current events, of civic problems or neighborhood projects, a book review, a report on a current magazine. Too often magazines in the home are read by only one member and the contents are unread by the others. Much valuable and interesting material is appearing in the better magazines today. If one or more of those present would undertake the review of some article of interest, it would be a stimulus to his own development and of interest to all. For those who like music, an evening of singing around the piano can be delightful, as can also be an evening spent in listening to recorded symphonies. If a guest is known to have a hobby, he may like to demonstrate it or discuss it, and games always make an evening enjoyable. In these changing times should thought not be given to the preservation of the home and the reestablishment of its place in the lives of both children and adults? Practically all entertainment was provided by the members of the family in former times, with a resultant development of those taking part. Such growth is not promoted by sitting in a darkened movie under the emotional drive of scene and symbol in a world of unreality. Whatever one can do to add to the meaning of the home will be helpful in maintaining the kind of citizenship that has e made America strong. Every mother who gives thought and care and effort to the creation of an interesting and cultured home, adds a touch of sweetness and enrichment to the lives of all who spend an hour within its walls. Home is a woman's rightful throne. Suggestions For a spring evening use a bowl of violets with yellow doilies or tablecloth, and have a tiny violet corsage on each napkin (for the men, too). Serve: Meringued peaches*, custard sauce*, cookies, lemonade, or orange-cream-filled* sponge cake, hot postum. Green is spring's own choice. With green doilies use your best white china and white lilacs. Your table will look as crisp as a white starched pinafore. Serve: Vanilla ice cream with hot cherry sauce or crushed strawberries, warm cup cakes, french chocolate* or lemon meringue pie, beverage. *Meringued Peaches: Drain canned peaches or peel, stone, and cut in half fresh peaches. Place on cookie sheet or baking pan. Top with COME IN FOR DESSERT 223 meringue, leaving in peaks. Place in oven and bake 325? for 10-15 minutes. Do not cook too fast. Meringue: Add two tablespoons sugar to each egg white. Add 1/8 teaspoon baking powder. Beat egg white until stiff. Add the sugar and baking powder and beat until glossy. * Custard Sauce: 1 cup milk 3 egg yolks /4 cup sugar 1 tbsp. Flour Vanilla flavoring 1/2 cup cream. Beat egg yolks, add the sugar and flour. Gradually add the scalded milk, cook until thickened. (Use a double boiler to prevent scorching.) Cool. Add flavoring. Whip cream and fold into the custard. To obtain cream for whipping: Spoon top carefully from milk bottles (not the children's milk). From a 2-quart bottle you can get 12-16 teaspoons of cream that will whip. Save in refrigerator in a bottle until you have enough (3-4 days). * Orange-Cream Filling: 3/4 cup sugar 5 tbsp. Flour 1/2 teasp. Salt 1 tbsp. Orange rind 1/2 cup hot water 1 cup orange juice 4 egg yolks | tbsp. Lemon juice 2 tbsp. Butter Mix sugar, salt, flour, and orange rind. Add orange juice and hot water. Cook until thick, stirring constantly. (Use double boiler or turn heat low.) Add beaten egg yolks and butter and continue to cook 3-5 minutes. Add lemon juice, beating thoroughly, and cool. Split sponge cake and spread on thickly, and fill center hole. Frost with seven-minute icing or whipped cream. *French Chocolate: 3 squares unsweetened chocolate 1/2 cup water Hot milk 3/4 cup sugar Dash of salt cup cream Combine chocolate and water and cook for 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Add sugar and salt and cook 4-6 minutes longer. Cool. Whip cream and fold in. Place one rounding tablespoon in each cup, and pour over hot milk. Stir to blend. Serve at the table, putting chocolate mixture in a silver bowl and hot milk in that special pot or pitcher. The chocolate mixture may be kept in the refrigerator for several days. THE CUPBOARD OF MY MIND Ann Young Hughes My thoughts are pretty dishes. This rare old china platter The cupboard is my mind, I fill with gems, and song. Where cups are filled with wishes And these I daily scatter Of almost every kind. To help some soul along. The saucer thoughts are shallow-I throw them all away For lovely bowls that hallow My heartfelt thoughts today. This urn of pain, not pleasure, Is cherished fragile ware That holds my rarest treasure? The thoughts of friends who care. Perennials For All-Year Blossoming Hazel D. Moyle ?FLOWERS are among God's finest thoughts of beauty, taking form to gladden mortal gaze?bright gems of earth, in which, perchance, we see what Eden was?what Paradise may be!\" These are the sentiments of a famous philosopher. Do we not, then, need flowers round our homes now as never before to comfort our spirits and give us hope and courage during these dark and busy war times? To me the meanest flower that blows can give? Thoughts that do often lie too deep for words. So said the poet Wordsworth. Let us not deprive ourselves of these lovely symbols of truth and beauty: every home should be a citadel of tranquillity ?during these troubled times, a place where our faith can be restored and our dreams renewed. We need our flower gardens in which to reclaim our ideals? but just how are we to find time to grow flowers, with the daily schedule of everyone already so overcrowded? The answer may be found in the planting of perennial flowers, for these plants are more or less permanent additions to the garden, once they have become established. The perennials live over year after year, many of them giving increasing bloom and beauty as the years Page 224 pass. They become old friends, reappearing with punctual precision each at its appointed time. We have chosen six well-known and easy-to-grow perennials as being essential for every garden, for by planting these six indispensables any home flower lover can enjoy bloom from spring until fall frosts arrive, and almost every back yard can find room and time to cultivate such a simple planting. While there are many other beautiful and worthy flowers that can be grown without a great deal of skill or extra work, we believe the following should be in every garden, not only for their desirability and beauty, but because they thrive with ordinary care in almost any location. The peony comes first on the list, because it is the earliest to bloom and also because of its long life. Last year I saw a fine old peony plant that had flowered each spring for thirty-five years without replanting ?and it was a garden in itself with its great mass of nearly fifty large double blooms. Remember, when you set out roots of the peony next fall (for this plant should never be planted in spring), that in order to enjoy such a performance of flowers, perhaps for the rest of your lifetime, you should see that it is planted correctly. Choose a spot in full sun, well PERENNIALS FOR ALL-YEAR BLOSSOMING 225 away from trees and overhanging growth, and dig a hole at least two feet deep. In the lower half of this hole you must place good, rich nourishment for those future years of bloom, old barnyard manure should be used generously and well tramped down. Then a layer of ordinary, good garden loam should be thrown in, upon which to set the roots. The pink buds or eyes should be placed one inch below the surface of the soil?this is of the greatest importance for too deep planting is the cause of many failures in blooming?firm this soil well before planting, so the new roots do not settle too deeply, then fill up the hole and water well. Choosing from the bewildering wealth of lovely and desirable varieties offered in the catalogues, becomes a major problem for any flower lover, but if you will use the rating of each kind as given by the American Peony Society, printed plainly in front of the description in all reliable catalogues, this will assist you greatly in making your choice. Good points are rated up to ten which would make a perfect flower. There are actually some with the highest rating of 9:09 that are now very cheap in price. Any variety receiving a rating of 8 or more should be a good choice, those of lower rating usually having some fault or other. Remember that by choosing early, midseason, and also late-blooming varieties, you can enjoy a long season of bloom, and, if you have room, do include that grand old flower, the Decoration Day peony, officinalis. This is available in pink, red and white. It is a flower of satiny luster and it also blooms two weeks or more before other varieties. The second perennial on our list is the iris.... And who would do without this wonderful flower! Designed just for the busy gardener, this accepts our hot, dry climate with amiability, demanding little care. Ordinary unmanured soil suits it well, its one absolute requirement being an open, sunny situation. In order to bring out the full beauty of the lovely, silken iris flower, the plants should be well watered while buds are forming, and during the flowering. (You can prolong the blooms and make them much larger, too, by watering generously at this time.) But for the rest of the year they can stand neglect. If you have not grown any of the newer varieties of iris, then you have a treat in store. Every garden should find room for the exquisite, great, orchid-like bloom of the variety \"William Mohr,\" which can now be purchased for a mere trifling twenty-five cents. A still newer and lovelier variety in named \"Ormohr,\" costing a dollar or more. Iris experts have recently produced one named \"El-mohr,\" the same breath-taking size and beauty, but taller and of a deeper colored mulberry-purple. Being a rare, new type (producing a seven-inch flower), this demands a high price, however, in a few years, we can all enjoy it at a reasonable price. \"Purissima,\" a beauteous white variety, and \"Wabash,\" notable prizewinner with great blue-purple falls and white standards, also deserve every gardener's consideration ?but choose for yourself according \n226 to your own tastes and purse and space.\nThis can be transplanted at almost any season, even when in full bloom. So if you see some flower that you covet, this coming June, there is no reason why you should not take a start home with you.\nTHE third perennial on our list is the flaunting 'oriental' poppy. For sheer glamour and breath-taking beauty, one need look no farther than the new varieties of this fine old flower with their beautiful, silken flowers of such melting colors as coral, geranium-pink, flame, cerise and shell-pink. The finest of all is named 'Wonderkininde,' a great flower of lustrous watermelon pink, as large as a dinner plate.\nThis plant has one strict requirement: it should be planted during its dormant season, which is from August until late fall. Spring planting brings only failure, so be sure to order your plants when the poppies bloom during late May and June. Once established, there are few more faithful garden subjects, and their requirements are just ordinary garden care.\nJuly brings the splendid towers of blue of the modern delphiniums. Even one or two of these spike-like flowers can lift any garden out of the ordinary. While these proud blooms require a little more attention in staking and watering than others of our list, they are well worth the trouble. A lower and more spreading type named 'Delphinium Belladonna' can be grown with less care, and is longer lived than the tall new hybrids. Both are lovely.\nThe midsummer phlox is number five on our list?where could we find a finer flower for this time of year? The great, magnificent heads of bloom can now be had in a bewildering variety of vibrant and flaming colors. In cooler sections of Utah and Idaho this perennial fairly outdoes itself. Plant your phlox in most ground where they receive morning sun, but where they are shaded in the late afternoon. And if yours is a hot, dry garden, prepare the ground well with very old manure, then mulch the surface each spring with peat moss, lawn clippings, or more old manure. And if the flower heads are clipped off as soon as they have faded, others will form just below, and you can enjoy phlox for many weeks. Soak the plants deeply by allowing the hose to run without a nozzle during the blooming period.\nOur last flower is the chrysanthemum, for this is the queen of all fall flowers and one that brings an entire new season of beauty into your garden. Recent hybridizing has brought us many new types and varieties, many being early enough to bloom and valuable in colder sections where ordinary chrysanthemums seldom flower. The University of Minnesota has worked for years on an early and extra-hardy strain, and a splendid list of kinds and colors of these are now available as well as many other desirable new kinds and colors.\nThe cushion mums, growing into a low, bush-like plant, each so floriferous that one plant becomes a garden in itself, are also brilliant and lovely. One can now have chrysanthemums of almost any color except blue, and the taller Chrysanthemums will do in just PERENNIALS FOR ALL-YEAR BLOSSOMING 227 ordinary good garden loam, but will pay handsome dividends in deep color and profuse bloom if the plants are given a little extra feeding during the growing year. This is easily done by applying a one-inch mulch of old, well-rotted manure (cow manure is best) around each plant at two-or-three week intervals. First cultivate the surface, then apply the manure, and follow immediately with a thorough, deep soaking, preferably with the nozzle of the hose removed. Do not sprinkle as this sometimes brings mildew. This mulch helps to keep the soil moist at the same time it supplies mild feeding. With this, our sixth perennial, the year is brought to a close with a brilliant fanfare, a fitting farewell to summer. And the joyous part is that these same plants do not die, but when spring once more returns they arise from their winter's sleep in response to some mysterious call? The gentle heat and soft repeated rains, Make the green blood to dance within their veins, Then, at the call, emboldened out they come. And swell the gems, and burst the narrow room; Broader and broader yet their blooms display, Salute the welcome sun and entertain the day, \"Spring\"?Dryden THE RESTLESS HEART Courtney E. Cottam Do not seek for me in the quiet heart Of a June-blown, golden rose, Nor in the twilight-shadowed pause That marks the daytime's close. Look for me where the poppy breaks, In a splash of flaming red; Where lightning opens a silver path. There my dancing feet will tread. For mine is a restless, burning heart. That spurns the weakling's cry; My pagan soul serves the storm god's might-In spirit, the fearing die! The Strength of the Pack Mary Petteison \n\"MOTHER, why are you up so early? It's only a quarter after six!\" Jane exclaimed as she came into the kitchen in her night gown.\nHer mother continued to sift flour into her mixing bowl till the sifter was empty. Setting it down she said firmly, \"Don't you realize what there is to do today? I have to be in court for Steven at half past nine.\"\nJane's mouth made ready to answer, but her mother, anticipating contradiction, went on to say, \"I know I don't have to be there till ten o'clock, but I want to be off the street before everyone in this community is on his way to work or to shop. Besides I'll have to prepare something for lunch that I can set down in a hurry, because you know I'm due at the Supply Depot at one o'clock.\"\n\"It makes me sick to think that Steve would be so silly as to get mixed up in a scrape with that tramp of a Rink Shader. When I asked him what he did it for he told me it was none of my business. I'd like to know if it isn't.\" Jane finished scornfully.\nJane's mother turned and faced her. \"He's my son and I don't want you to talk that way about Steven, but he was wrong to tell you it was none of your business. It is the whole family's business. What we'll have to do is to try to keep it from happening again. We must try to help him to live above his\nthings. I feel as if it were all my fault,\" she sighed.\n\"I don't see why,\" Jane protested. \"I do, and it's hard to take,\" her mother answered remorsefully.\nJane heaped two self-praise. \"See what I've done, I've kept myself and helped you with the living expense. I've had nice friends, too.\"\nMrs. Paige answered in a kindlier tone, \"Yes, you've done fine, but you must remember we've sort of worked together,' and for the first time Jane noticed that her mother had been crying.\n\"I'll come right back and help you, Mother,\" Jane said sympathetically, as she hurried off to dress.\n\"Jane,\" her mother called into the hall, \"be careful not to waken Lorna, but when you get dressed go upstairs and rouse Dwight and Ned. Breakfast is at seven this morning.\"\nSteven came into the kitchen with his shoes in his hand and sat down to put them on. His mother looked at him sadly. \"Here is a clean shirt, and you had better put on your best shoes, I want you to look neat and respectable. Hurry and get dressed because you know you have to report at school before you come to court.\"\nMrs. Paige walked hurriedly along the streets of Riverton. She carried no umbrella though rain seemed imminent. Above all, she hoped she could not meet not be overtaken by anyone she knew. She was too full of doubts and regrets to carry on conversation. She remembered how often in her sorrow her friends had persuaded her to get out among people. \"Children that are watched too much don't get along any better than those that are put on their own responsibility\" had been offered as sound advice.\nJust as she reached the street corner on the opposite side from the court house, she saw Judge Alden ascending the steps. She quickened her gait, wishing to speak with him before he settled down to office routine. She entered the main hall just as he was going into his office. \"Good morning, Mrs. Paige,\" he said cheerfully, and closed the door.\nFull of misgiving and disappointment, she went into the Juvenile Court and seated herself on the east side of the room, four seats back from the Judge's table.\nA crash of thunder echoed through the building and the rain began to fall copiously. She sat watching the ever-flooding window, lost in the problem which faced her. At length she murmured, \"There's no use of talking to the Judge about my trouble. I know the ins and outs of it myself.\" She remembered the day when Steven had come in confidently and asked, \"Mother, will you buy me a wheel, nearly all the boys have one?\"\n\"No! I can't afford to buy you a bicycle,\" she had replied curtly, \"now let that end it.\" He had not spoken more, and she recalled now that he had never mentioned it again. She felt he had neglected her children and her duty as a mother, and began twisting her blue fabric gloves into rope-like furiousas, as she tried to think what she could do to get control of her emotions and her affairs. She shook the\ngloves loose as a thought shaped itself in her mind. I'll try and get Steven away from Rink Shader. I'll sell my house and move to a better neighborhood. She visioned her house and yard in detail. How shabby it all was, no one would buy it. Then another thought came to her. It wouldn't do any good to sell, all the children in the town attended the same school. It was not the location of one's home nor the failings of neighbors that brought one sorrow, it was one's own shortcomings. She put her hand over her eyes, \"Father in heaven what shall I do?\" she prayed.\nJust then the son came from behind the clouds and shown full on the rain-drenched window, as when a child smiles through its tears. The light at once drew Steven about her to a realization of where she was. She straightened her shoulders against the back of the bench and noticed that everyone connected with the case was in his seat, except the delinquent boys. What if they had decided to ignore the appointment! She cringed at the thought, but then she saw them coming through a side door, all eyes turned upon them. The Judge nodded toward them and indicated the chairs they were to occupy. Rink led the way shamefaced and dejected. He didn't expect anyone to sympathize with him, he would tell the Judge the truth and that was all he could do. Steven followed. His head was held high as if he were determined to face his mistake like a man, though it could be seen by his pale face and set mouth that he had suffered. Tears gathered in his mother's eyes at the thought of his misdemeanor. As he sat down he cast a furtive glance around the room, and caught the sympathetic gaze of his mother which gave him assurance. He sat up straight, his right hand holding the left one firmly.\nMrs. Paige listened intently to the court proceedings, the first one she had ever attended.\nThe Judge said seriously and yet with a tone of kindness in his voice, \"Rinkler Shader how did are you?\"\n\"I'll be thirteen the ninth of May.\"\n\"What does your father do?\"\n\"He's a brakeman on the S.P.\"\n\"Does your mother work any place outside your home?\n\"My mother is dead, but Aunt Mattie keeps house.\"\n\"Rinkler, I want you to tell me just how you got the idea to steal the bicycle\"\n\"Oh, I've wanted a wheel for a long time, and Trent Cage told me he could buy anything he wanted?'ed I thought it he's so rich he'd never miss the wheel.\"\nThe Judge raised his brows. \"Remember, my boy, if you take anything that belongs to another whether he be rich or poor, that is stealing.\"\nTurning to Miss Anson the Judge asked, 'Do you have any trouble with this boy in school?\"\n\"No, I wouldn't call it trouble. Rinkler has his faults, I've never known him to lie or steal.\"\n\"Steven Paige, stand please,\" the Judge ordered.\nSteven rose and faced the Judge with a confident, co-operative attitude.\nAfter a few personal questions which the boy answered promptly, Judge Allen asked \"How long before Trent lost his bicycle did you\nknow that Rinkler was going to steal it?\"\n\"Oh, I didn't know he was going to steal it, but I knew he had wanted a wheel for a long time,\" Steven replied anxiously.\n\"When did you first know that he had stolen the wheel?\" the Judge persisted.\n\"When I went with him to get it out of its hiding place, I thought something was wrong,\" Steven answered quietly.\n\"What did he promise you if you wouldn't tell where he got it?\" the Judge suggested.\n\"I asked him where he got it, and he said, 'Never mind where I got it, we are going to have it for our own,' \" Steven followed fearlessly.\n\"Don't you know that to use that wheel has been obtained dishonestly is next to stealing?\" the Judge demanded almost fiercely.\n\"No, sir,\" Steven replied, amazed at the serious attitude of the Judge.\nThe Judge leaned back in his chair, \"I think you boys are very ignorant of the difference between right and wrong, and, I want you to report to the probation officer every Friday afternoon at four o'clock, until he tells you that you are dismissed. Will you do that?\" the Judge asked, addressing Steven.\n\"Yes, sir, we will be there every Friday afternoon at four o'clock,\" Steven affirmed, and Rink nodded his head in agreement.\n\"All right, boys, you are excused. Now, don't forget to come.\" Then addressing the court: \"If there is nothing further, the court is dismissed.\" As he gathered up his papers, he noticed that Mrs. Paige and her son had left and he turned to speak to me?\" he asked kindly. THE STRENGTH OF THE PACK 231 \"Not now, thank you. I think I had better go home at once, though I may come and see you soon,\" she smiled gratefully. Rising resolutely she nodded to Miss Shader and Miss Anson, who were in close conversation, and left the room. QUTSIDE the air was stimulating. The sun was still shining, but it was blowing a little, and dark clouds were driving across the sky toward the east. Mrs. Paige hurried along, searching her mind for a clue that would develop into a workable plan whereby she might go on with her work and still keep the children busy at something useful. So deep was the trend of her thoughts that she was home before she knew it, but she had made her decision. Filled with energy and purpose she set the table, taking more pains than she had done since John's death. Steven rushed in all out of breath. \"My, that's a scrumptious lunch. May I eat right now?\" \"Guess so, but where are the others? Didn't they get out when you did?\" she asked apprehensively. \"Yes, but I hurried. I have to get back and make up the work I missed this morning when I went to court,\" he replied seriously. At the mention of \"court\" Mrs. Paige's face took on a grave expression. \"Shucks, Mother, don't be worried. Just because I was with Rink doesn't mean that I was stealing,\" Steven declared stoutly. \"I'm glad it isn't any worse, but you know what the Judge said. You accepted the use of the bicycle when you felt it was not right for Rink to keep it,\" she replied, looking at him keenly. \"Yes, but the Judge doesn't understand. I didn't know that was like stealing,\" Steven defended. \"It's just this way, Steven, you can't have anything to do with wrongdoing without getting tainted. I tell you we've got to get hold of ourselves and understand each other. I want to help you all I can, but if you are not going to stand by me I'll have to give up,\" she said with finality. \"Aw, Bus says your parents have to take care of you. He said his dad tried to run that bluff on him, but it wouldn't work,\" Steven divulged with bravado. Mrs. Paige was astonished to hear Steven repeat such remarks. \"I don't care what Bus says. It's what you say that matters to me. What are you going to do?\" \"How can I help without any money?\" he asked discouragedly. \"Help! You have been helping all the time. How would I have managed if you hadn't taken Lorna down to Aunt Nell's every morning, and then come back in time to help Dwight and Ned off to school? If you'll do what I want you to do, we'll find a way to make money honestly, and we will be able to buy anything we need.\" = \"What will we do?\" Steven asked doubtfully. \"I'm working on a plan which I think will be just what we want. When I get it worked out we are going to have a family home-meeting and discuss it. It just concerns our own family, so keep it a secret till we all decide what to do,\" she explained cheerily. \"Oh, that will be swell,\" Steven beamed with enthusiasm. \"Golly, look at the time! I'll have to go.\" Jane came in just as Steven was leaving. He didn't look at her, but she noticed how pale he looked. She sat down at the table silently, and began to unfold her paper napkin. Mrs. Paige brought two plate lunches to the table. \"I waited to eat with you,\" she said as she moved up her chair. \"I've at last awakened to my duty. When I realize how I've left the boys to their own thoughts and ways, Fm ashamed! We don't know who their friends are. It breaks my heart to think how I've shushed them when. They wanted to come in to play on a stormy night. From now on I want them to come inside and bring their friends, so I can know them and help them all to know right from wrong.\" \"That will mean a lot of work and worry, goodness knows we have enough to do now,\" Jane reminded. \"No, we can make it a pleasure and not a hardship if we manage it rightly,\" her mother answered confidently, and continued to elaborate on the necessity of knowing with whom the boys played. Jane thought, I simply can't understand what's changed mother; but she did not speak. She looked at her watch as she rose from the chair, \"Oh, it's a quarter to one.\" \"I'll go now, too,\" her mother decided, \"I can leave the table just as it is. Steven knows what to do.\" The two women left the house together, but their minds were miles apart, the one lighthearted and carefree, the other carrying the responsibility of guiding a family into ways of righteousness. It had been Mrs. Paige's intention to sound Jane out as to what she thought could be done about conditions at home. \"Oh I don't know. Mother, what would be best to do, but I'm willing to help in whatever you decide,\" Jane promised. As the girl went to her work, her mother reminded her, \"We hold our first home-meeting tonight.\" Mrs. Paige walked on, she was amazed at the possibilities which kept coming to her mind. THAT very night, after supper, she told the children about her plan, and they were delighted with it and pledged to do all they could to make it a success. \"Do you remember the story of the wolves, how they worked together?\" their mother asked, her eyes glowing with enthusiasm. \"Yes,\" Dwight answered, \"all their leader needed to do was to give a loud howl and the wolves came racing through the forest, barking once in a while to let him know they were coming, and soon the whole pack would be there, ready to take orders.\" \"Yes, that's just what they did. They seemed to live up to this rule, that 'the wolf is the strength of the pack and the pack is the strength of the wolf. We are going to be like that, we'll work together no matter what comes,\" she finished firmly. They all agreed on their officers. Steven was made president, his mother, vice president, Dwight was appointed secretary-treasurer, and Jane became the chairman of the THE STRENGTH OF THE PACK 233 ways and means committee with Ned and Lorna for helpers. \"I think mother's plan for gardening is the best thing she could have thought out? Steven, as president, declared, after his mother had disclosed her plan. \"Let's decide on what we'll plant right now.\" Mrs. Paige suggested that beans which could be sold, should occupy the greater part of the garden plot and that they should also raise plenty of other vegetables for home use. She agreed to pay the treasurer market prices for whatever she used in the kitchen. At the conclusion of the meeting Mrs. Paige called Lorna and whispered to her. Lorna, smiling happily, went into the kitchen cabinet and brought out a dish of mixed candy and nuts, which she passed to each member, while her mother instructed the boys on how to clean up the yard, and then told them she had already engaged a man for the next day to spread the fertilizer and help do the digging. As Mrs. Paige neared her home the next night, she knew by the sounds coming from the back yard that the boys were at work. Rink is there, too, I can hear him talking, she thought. She went around to the back and stood looking on. He was the first to spy her. \"Don't you think we're doing a good job, Mrs. Paige?\" he laughed, the perspiration running down his face. \"You certainly are, but doesn't your aunt need you?\" she replied a little coldly. \"Oh, I've done my chores, and I thought I?d help Steve work on the yard, if you don't mind,\" he finished, fearing her disapproval. \"Of course I don't mind. I think it's nice of you to want to help,\" she praised, and went into the house. As she removed her suit to put on her house dress, she could still see how his expression had changed when she had praised him a little. I just can't be mean to him, she decided. He is so anxious to please, and he has some good traits that I like, he tells the truth and he isn't lazy. I wish I could help him. His Aunt Mattie is too easygoing and his father is the kind of a man who never seems to realize how much a child needs guidance, she reflected. Rf4NE afternoon in July when Mrs. Paige came home, Steven was busy in the garden. He saw her coming and called happily, \"Mother, come and see the garden. Did you ever see so many beans in all your life?\" \"I've never seen vines more heavily laden. We'll have to pick them soon, but we must be careful not to destroy the vines,\" she answered, remembering that there would be many pickings. The next evening Mrs. Paige returned to find that the beans had all been picked. \"Oh, Steven, why did you do it before you had customers to buy them?\" she reasoned. Steven looked crestfallen, \"I never thought of that.\" Mrs. Paige bit her lip, \"Well, the only thing we can do is to cover them up with wet cloths till morning.\" Early the next day, Dwight and Ned were sent out with samples of beans to try and find customers among the neighbors, but they had little success. 234 \"Steven, you'll have to go farther, to the homes where they buy all their vegetables. The boys can never sell all these around here/' \"Oh, I can't sell them, I don't want to go asking people to buy beans.\" Just then Rink came around the house. \"Jiminy, what a lot of beans! Did you get all them out of your patch, Steve?\" \"Yes, and now he hates to go and sell them,\" Mrs. Paige interposed. \"Come on, Steve, I'll go with you.\" Rink filled a small pail with beans and the two started off. They tried several places without selling any. Becoming discouraged they sat down by the roadside, wondering what to do. All at once Rink brightened, \"There comes Chinese John! I'll bet he'll buy 'em. He told Aunt Mattie that all his beans got flooded out,\" Rick explained as he ran out into the road holding up the beans. \"Hi, John you want to buy some beans? Only ten cents a pound.\" John drew on the reins. \"Bleans! Yi, Yi, me bly bleans. Low M'lany?\" \"Forty pounds\" Steven gladly spoke up. John turned his cart around and followed the boys home. Mrs. Paige was astonished when she saw Chinese John pass the window with two baskets over his shoulders, but she did not go out for she wanted Steven to manage the selling. Presently, Steven and Rink came in with four dollars and twenty cents, the price of forty-two pounds of beans, and Steven said with a business air, \"Mother, give this to the treasurer when he comes.\" EARLY one warm forenoon in August, Mrs. Paige sat thinking, as she worked, of her experience during the summer. Everything was beginning to turn out according to her plan. It was true there had been some drawbacks, but she was satisfied with the results so far. One thing, especially, pleased her. She had been a help to the boys in her entire neighborhood, for the victory garden idea had spread, and nearly every child was busily and happily working in a garden. She was just rejoicing over the success of her example when Steven came in all out of breath, \"Mother, Rink and Bus are going up East Canyon to fish and stay all night, let me go with them, please,\" he pleaded. \"Oh, I wouldn't go if I were you. We are all going up there to stay a few days next week. The boys might go then as your guests. Let me see, today is probation day isn't it? Remember you musn't miss it,\" she admonished. \"I don't want to go next week. I want to go now!\" he replied, and dashed out of the house. Steven was not home at lunch time, but he had never, up to now, openly disobeyed her, so she trusted that he had not gone, and she went to work at one o'clock as usual. When she returned, Lorna came running to meet her as she did every night, \"Mother, Steven's gone a-fishing with Rink and Bus,\" she confided. \"He has!\" Mrs. Paige exclaimed in surprise. She took hold of the child's hand with a deep sense of defeat. By evening there was still no THE STRENGTH OF THE PACK 235 word from Steven. His mother went about preparing the supper as if nothing unusual was on her mind, but she was troubled. Just as the family finished the dessert Steven came in with several fish threaded in the crotch of a willow bough. His mother exclaimed, \"Well, here you are at last! Put the fish in that pan in the sink and come and eat now.\" The children were delighted with the fish, but their mother made no comment. Later in the evening Mrs. Paige sat alone reading. Steven came and stood at the back of her chair, \"Mother, Fm awful sorry I went, but-\" \"Were you standing by the pack when you disobeyed me?\" she asked with emphasis. \"Let me tell you how it was,\" he pleaded humbly. \"Now, don't tell me what Rink and Bus did. The idea of you doing what they wanted you to do. You ought to lead them, but you will never be a leader till you learn to make your own decisions,\" she interrupted. \"It was this way,\" Steven continued, \"I wanted to go so bad I felt that nothing else mattered, not even disobedience or my pledge to the pack. After we got there, though, I wasn't happy, and I begged Rink to come back with me in time to go and see Mr. Wooten. We were a little late, but I told him why, and he said, \"You boys sure know how to keep a promise, and now I dismiss you from your obligation of reporting to me.\" \"Oh, I?m so glad you persuaded Rink to go with you to see the probation officer. That's good leadership, Steven,\" she said proudly, \"though-\" \"Mother, please forgive me, I?ll never disobey you again,\" he broke in, the tears flooding his eyes. \"All right, I will forgive you. Now let's forget it,\" she replied earnestly. He leaned over, kissing her, and she returned his kiss fervently. Mrs. Paige sniffed and wiped her eyes. \"You know it's your birthday Sunday, and I want you to invite Rink to dinner.\" \"Oh, Mother, you are too good to me. I don't deserve it,\" he said though his brown eyes laughed with delight. Sunday, Mrs. Paige rose early to get the children off to Sunday School and to make preparations for the birthday dinner. The first thing she did after they had all gone was to frost the cake thick with white icing and write \"Steven\" in the center with yellow. Fourteen small, yellow candles adorned the edge, all ready to be lighted at the proper time. When the children came in at noon the table was set with the best silver and linen, with the cake as a centerpiece. Once they were all seated at the table, Mrs. Paige thought it was one of the happiest moments of her life. Rink, looking like a Rhode Island red rooster with his auburn hair combed sleek, smiled from ear to ear. After the dinner was over, Dwight and Ned slipped out of the room, and soon the two boys came in rolling a bicycle. Steven gasped in surprise, he had not expected a present. A card attached to the handle bar read: \"To Steven?The wolf is the strength of the pack?and the pack is the strength of the wolf.\" And Once to Grandma Doris Palmer GRANDMA Stanton looked wistfully after the mail truck, fading fast disappearing down the dusty street. Grandma had walked the six blocks to the little post office in the heart of the small rural town of Lakeview, for the past five days, and had received no word of any kind from any of her five children. They were all married now, and had families of their own. This was the first year Grandma hadn't had birthday cards and gifts sent in plenty of time for her birthday. Now only one short day remained.\n\"I'm sure there will be something tomorrow, Grandma,\" Donald Harmon, postmaster and owner of the small grocery store adjoined, comforted her, \"I'll bet your birthday will be remembered all right.\"\n\"Oh, I am sure it will,\" Grandma tried to reassure herself, \"but I never bet in my life, Donald Harmon.\"\n\"Well, you would lose this bet,\" Donald called after Grandma's retreating figure. Everyone in Lakeview loved and understood Grandma Stanton. She always put on a brave front, and underneath had a sweet and sensitive nature.\nThere was no time to stop and talk with friends who called to her as she hurried home?not this morning. Granddad was getting the ground ready for the vegetable and flower garden. They were late in getting it planted anyway.\nGrandma viewed their large, comfortable home with mixed feelings as she approached. The house was of colonial design, set back from the road amongst a group of oak and fragrant locust trees. To the right was the family orchard. The trees were already covered with pink and white blossoms. On the left was the vegetable garden. Two cedar pines decorated the front gate, one on each side of the walk.\nThe Browns lived one block nearer town, and the Hudsons two blocks farther north. The Hudsons paddled the three Jersey cows Grandma insisted on keeping. She did love to take care of milk, and make her own yellow butter and creamy buttermilk.\nGrandma and Granddad had been among the first settlers in Lakeview, and had watched its growth with pride and interest; but they had sold their farm to the Hudsons when the two boys had chosen other professions, two of the girls had married business men and Mary had married a young doctor in the nearby college town. It was there she had attended school and won a teacher's certificate, only to get married the following season. Now the old house was empty of young voices.\nGranddad was leaning on the plough handles waiting for Grandma's approval of the ground. Maybe it was not deep enough, and Granddad was not taking any chances. His hat was pushed back from his ruddy face, disclosing the shock of gray curly hair that was so like a little boy's. His bright blue eyes were twinkling at Grandma as she came through the gate.\"No packages, Maw?\" he questioned, glancing at her empty hands. \"Not a blessed thing, Dad. Do you suppose something's the matter with any of them?\"\n\"Now, don't go to supposin', or you'll have 'em all sick,\" Granddad interrupted. \"Don't some of the teachers graduate next month?\"\nGrandma thought a minute. \"Why I believe Lanie graduates from high school and little Lennie from grammar.\"\n\"Well, em's mighty dang expensive to graduate 'em nowadays, Maw. Jane says they reckon on presents and a lot of fine new clothes.\"\nGrandma sighed. \"Yes, I know, Dad. It's not like when we went to school. We were only too glad to be able to go. Maybe that's why Ellen and I never bought 'em presents, but they could write a fine long letter. Mary was coming to visit next month, or as soon as school was out and John could get away.\" Grandma was trying to find excuses for her children and, as usual, she succeeded. So now she brushed the little uneasy feeling behind her, and proceeded to boss Granddad and the making of her garden.\n\"Dad, can we get the vegetables planted this afternoon? Dear, dear, there is so much to do. We will just have to,\" Grandma decided. \"I can plant my flowers in the morning.\"\nGranddad nodded his gray head and pushed his hat to a perilous position, squinting at the heavens. Off to the southwest were angry-looking clouds tumbling over each other as though driven by the thunder that could be heard ever louder as the men plowed.\n\"Thunder shower comin', Maw. Better get your little chicks in. It'll be here soon. It'll be the very thing for the garden. Get up, Dane,\" he clucked to the big gray horse, \"Let's get this finished.\"\nGrandma raised her pleasant, seamed face to the growing wind and sniffed it eagerly. You could already smell the rain. That sweet, earthy smell. It was on just such a night that many years ago, it seemed to Grandma, that Robert came running in, his round face dirty and excited. \"Mother! Jane said I could just taste the dirt after a rain. She told a lie didn't she, Mom?\" He had been disappointed when she had told him that Jane just thought she could, because the smell was so fresh and strong. Grandma smiled at the remembrance.\nLennie's mischievous face then came before her, as he hurried to the chicken yard. His curly, white head could be seen now and then of the day bobbing up and down amongst the chickens. He would delight in these little chicks, she thought, picking up the different colored little bits of fluff, and putting them in the box with their mother where they chirped contentedly. Somehow Lennie never did hurt them or hold them too tight after Robert did. She had always told him he should raise chickens.\nGrandma's thoughts often strayed back to the time when her family was at home. As she hurried about the neat, sunny kitchen preparing the simple dinner, she wondered if Mary still loved home-cured ham. She placed thick slices of it beside the pitcher of creamy milk. Robert used to drink milk until she couldn't see how he managed to eat anything else. It wasn't so long ago that Lennie, home from college, had put his arms around her, giving her a \"bear hug,\" as he called it. He had bragged that no one in the world could turn out such nifty-tasting bread out of common flour. If she could just have them all back together again to cook for and pamper, it would be heavenly. She brushed away an obstinate tear as she went to call Granddad.\nIt sprinkled a little as they were eating \"It's just teasing,\" Granddad said, \"we'll get a good one tonight. Be better for the garden anyway. It might have been too wet to plant this afternoon.\"\nThat evening after the garden was planted and the chores and supper over with, Granddad let the paper he was reading fall to the floor and looked at Grandma with twinkling eyes. Granddad's eyes were always twinkling lately, more than usual it seemed.\n\"Anna Brown was over this morning while you was uptown,\" Granddad remarked with an air of great importance. \"She wanted to know if you would save all your cream tonight and in the mornin'. She went on up to Hudson's to see if they would have some.\"\n\"My lands, what's she goin' to do with all that cream?\" Grandma's eyes were wide with wonder.\n\"Well, she said some of her school chums were comin' on a visit, and she wanted something nice and coolin'. So I reckon she is making ice cream. If'n, it sure would taste fine these warm days.\"\n\"Yes, it would, Dad. We might make some. If Ann didn't want more'n half, there would be plenty for Grandma's birthday tomorrow. Grandma was wondering who Anna's chums were that were coming. It was a shame the girls couldn't come now, too. Especially Mary. She would know them all. Her thoughts went back to their neglect of her birthday. It was the first time they had forgotten it since they had all left home.\nTHE Stantons were almost always up with the sun, but Grandma beat the sun this fresh spring morning. It had rained during the night and everything was washed clean, and was being brushed with gold as the sun sent its golden rays among the scented trees. The birds acted as though they would burst their throats with the silvery notes they spilled forth to gladden the world. Grandma's heart was light as she prepared breakfast, pausing now and then to breathe deeply of the clean, fragrant air. Granddad came in with the milk and admonished Grandma not to forget the cream Ann wanted. ?Too wet to plant your flowers this morning, Maw. I do not want to plant your flowers this morning, Maw. Reckon I could plant 'em this afternoon, if you won't be too blamed busy,\" Granddad offered.\n\"Well, I'll just keep the few dahlia bulbs I've got and you can plant the rest. I'll show you where I want them before I go for the mail. Maybe I'll stop a minute at Ann's on my way back.\"\n\"I wouldn't stop there if I was you, Maw. Ann will be busy, I reckon, with the party for her friends.\"\n\"Well my lands, that's why I'm stoppin', Maybe I can find out who it is comin',\" Grandma was surprised at Granddad's lack of interest in the coming friends. Ann had always been like one of their own daughters.\n\"Ain't you goin' to make a cake today, Maw? One of them fruit cakes the boys like so. You could make a cake for your birthday while I'm plantin' your garden for you.\" Granddad was one of the boys who liked the cake he suggested.\n\"It looks like I would have to, if I get one,\" Grandma said fretfully. \"Ann sent me one last birthday, but ain't five new with her friends today.\"\nGrandma had to wait a few minutes for the mail truck to arrive. There was no one else in the post-office but herself. Donald Harmon and herself. She fidgeted around looking at the labels on the canned goods, until Donald had begun to sort the mail.\n\"I guess no one else is so anxious there as me,\" Grandma remarked, a sensitive smile playing around her mouth.\n\"It's been kinda quiet all mornin' here,\" Donald answered, flipping the list he'd left over, hating to look into the eager eyes watching him so expectantly. \"I guess there ain't anything Grandma. There was no packages a'tall this morning, ain't there anything else you want?\" he questioned, trying not to notice the tears Grandma was dabbing at furtively.\n\"Yes, I want to get some currants and citrus. Oh yes, and some brown sugar,\" she replied, trying to steady her voice. Pshaw, she never was good at hiding her feelings.\n\"Sounds like a cake was in the makin', Gram-ma. If it's as good as the last cake you brought to Rilla's wedding social, I'll sure be good.\" \"Now, Donald, you are just try-in' to make me feel good,\" Grandma scolded, picking up her packages. \"Maybe I'll send you a piece of it,\" she called back from the door.\nGrandma was feeling pretty blue as she made her way back. She left old and out of everything.\nA sound of great activity met her as she paused at the little iron gate leading into Anna's. Maybe Ann would like the ice cream when she was so busy. Grandma hesitated, one hand on the latch. Curiosity got the better of her, however, so she marched up and knocked on the door. There was a sudden quiet as Ann came and opened the door. \"Why, hello Grandma,\" Ann said loudly. \"I never expected to see you over here. I thought you were planting flowers.\" \"It was too wet this morning and Dad's plantin' some this afternoon,\" Grandma explained shortly.\n\"Come on in, Grandma,\" Ann invited after a hasty glance over her shoulder.\n\"I was wonderin' if I couldn't come in,\" Grandma said, her quick eyes taking in the drops of colored frosting scattered on the dining table.\n\"Hello, Grandma,\" Helen Larsen cried, running up and kissing Grandma's withered cheek. \"I'm coming over tonight, if I get through helping Ann in time. It's your birthday today, isn't it?\" Ann broke in. \"Mary mentioned it in her last letter. Let's see, that's been two weeks ago,\" she said as though thinking. \"We should have had a party on Grandma, Helen,\" Ann said indignantly.\n\"At my age?\" Grandma scoffed. \"I?m gettin? too old for such doings.\" \"Wait till I get my hat, Grandma, and I'll go with you and get my cream.\" Ann ran into the bedroom as Grandma started collecting her bundles. \"You know, I never had a party in my life,\" Grandma confided as she placed the jug of cream in Ann's hands. \"Why, Grandma, honestly? We will certainly have to give you one sometime,\" Ann promised, a slight flush stealing over her face. \"Now Ann, I ain't askin' for a party, but I have always wanted one,\" she added wistfully, a faraway look in her e3'es. \"Well, I must hurry.\" Ann quickly dropped the money in Grandma's hand. \"Now don't forget, you have a party coming sometime in the future. Grandma,\" and Ann's face wore a happy smile. Granddad said he had to go uptown in the late afternoon and wanted to know if Grandma was going with him. \"Well, I was going to see Grandma Hudson but I'm kinda tired, so guess I'll just rest a bit,\" she replied. \"I reckon you better Maw, the Larsens are comin' over tonight and you don't want to feel tired.\" Granddad got home just in time to milk. It was growing dark when he finally came in for supper, making much over the fruit cake Grandma had placed in front of them. \"It's not my birthday. Maw,\" Granddad teased her. \"Oh hush, Dad.\" Grandma didn't want to be reminded of it. She couldn't help feeling the children had neglected her. Grandma and Granddad were quietly reading when a loud knocking and shuffling of feet brought Grandma to the door. The sight that met her startled eyes nearly made her faint. The whole front porch was crowded with people. In the front of the group were her own five children, loaded down with bundles. Packed around them was the whole town, it seemed to Grandma. The words \"Mother\" and \"Surprise\" were mingled together as Grandma was picked up and placed inside, to be instantly smothered with arms from all directions. Everyone began talking at once, trying to answer the puzzled questions Grandma couldn't keep from asking. \"You tell her, Anna,\" Mary called above the excited crowd. \"Well,\" Anna began, \"Mary and the rest of your family had the idea of bringing a surprise party on you, and asked Granddad to meet them on the 5:30 stage. That is all there is to it, except I was afraid you would catch on when you were at my place today. We were decorating the birthday cake when you walked up to the porch, and I had to make you wait at the door while Helen whisked it into the kitchen.\" \"But how could you children get away alone?\" Grandma wanted to know further. \"Well, we just decided it would be nice to be home together again, so we just left our present sweethearts for our former one!\" Lennie broke in, sitting with one arm around his happy mother. \"We can only stay a few days, except for Mary. She is staying and John is coming and bringing the youngsters in a few days, for a longer visit.\" 241 \"I think we should sing some songs to start the evening right and bring back old times,\" Robert suggested, getting up and motioning Ellen to the piano. \"Let's begin with 'When You and I Were Young, Maggie' and say 'Mary' instead of 'Maggie' when we come to it.\"\n\"Oh I don't believe I can stand much more,\" Grandma said in a shaky voice.\nAfter a few songs and games, Grandma looked up to find Granddad's twinkling eyes on her. \"Dad, you old cheater, did you know all about this and never told me?\"\n\"Sure, I did,\" Granddad was enjoying himself immensely, \"I even gave Ann the money to buy the cream with.\"\n\"Well, I never.\" Grandma sank back in her chair. \"And I never even suspected a thing.\"\nHappy tears blurred her eyes when the time came to cut the birthday cake. It wasn't the huge cake nor the many gifts that brought those tears, but the knowledge that her children had given her first party. 242 \"THIS, TOO, SHALL PASS AWAY\" Alice Whitson Norton No silver lining can I see behind the clouds to-day. That fall so uninvited on my head; So hopeless is the heart within the breast of me, Because a long, sweet, cherished dream is dead. Numbed by the constant agony of pain, my soul Is like a bier bereft of flowers bright; My thoughts?as motionless as some deep frozen pool And desolate as any unstarred night. And yet I know tomorrow's sun will rise and set, Just as it's done since God created day. And in its warmth I'll find myself remembering With gratitude, \"This, too, shall pass away.\" And then I'll ponder in my heart: \"Why did I grope In darkness, thus belittling, the silver gleam of hope?\" Ten Miles to Calico Martha Roheson Wiight THE autumn sun poured in through the open windows of the pioneer Mormon meetinghouse. As Mathilda Dawson sat down, it touched with gold the tawny braids wound round her restless, young head. It even brightened somewhat the drab hair of the girl's work-worn mother beside her on the split-log bench. But no sunlight, Tilda thought, could lend any luster to their dull-brown, homespun dresses. This was the Sunday-afternoon sacrament meeting, so her father sat with the Seventies, just behind the Elders at the front of the room. Tilda glanced around. Frank Robinson was in his usual place on the opposite side of the meetinghouse. Every Sunday she felt the same tingle, seeing him there among the Elders. This time, though, his twinkling gray eyes were not waiting for her to look his way. Tilda followed his gaze across the aisle to the women's side, a little in front of her seat. What she saw tightened her throat. The strange girl must be from Salt Lake City. She was gay and dainty in pink, white-sprigged calico. She had a clear white skin, and cheeks that glowed like the pink of her dress. Her hair was dark and shining beneath the perky yellow straw hat with pink ribbons on it. Her hands were white and graceful. They would be soft to touch. Tilda scowled down at her own hands. They were tanned almost black, rough and calloused, with Page 242 cracked nails and knuckles. Quickly she hid them in the folds of her skirt. Any girl could look pretty if she had the clothes, and never had done a lick of work in her life. What good would that one be in the country? Wouldn't her hands look like something when she got through scraping black pots and washing dishes in hard water and lye soap! Imagine those French kid shoes after a day's farm work, plowing, planting, hoeing, chopping wood. Wouldn't be worth sic'em! The congregation stood for the opening song. Now Tilda saw the nice fit of the city girl's dress?snug at the waist and with a billowy skirt, three tucks featherstitched in with white floss. \"Come, Come Ye Saints!\" Tilda sang lustily to hide the ache in her heart. That girl was like a princess. Frank couldn't help looking at a princess. Just the same, it hurt. After the song they sat down. Tilda wanted to crawl off somewhere. She clenched her fists during prayer. Automatically, she put the small piece of fine white sacrament bread in her mouth and swallowed. She sipped the water, passing the large goblet on to her mother. She scarcelv heard First Counselor Williams bearing testimony and telling how glorious it was to be out here in Zion where the Latter-day Saints might worship as they pleased. By the time of the closing song, Tilda had made up her mind to get some calico herself, for a dress as TEN MILES TO CALICO 243 pretty as that pink one. Prettier! As they walked out of meeting, she hurried ahead of her mother to avoid Frank. She wasn't going to have him look from her to the princess, comparing them. But he called, \"Tilda! Tilda!\" She turned, then seemed to freeze. He was talking to that girl. Tilda had to stand and wait until they caught up. 'Tilda, I want you to meet Clarissa Wilkins, from Salt Lake City. She's visiting our ward today.\" Smiling, Clarissa held out her hand, \"How do you do, Tilda.\" There was nothing to do but take the white hand. It was as soft as Tilda had thought it would be. Clarissa gave her rough palm a little squeeze before she let it go. \"Pleased to meet you,\" said Tilda. Clarissa acted friendly. \"I've never been to Ogden before, or out here to Lynne Ward, either. It's beautiful.\" Tilda always had loved her mountains and this sky, but she only said, very shortly, \"I guess so.\" What if Frank Robinson was squirming with embarrassment? Well, he didn't need to bring her and this girl together. \"Nice day to make the trip up, Sister Wilkins,\" he offered. \"Yes,\" she responded brightly. \"Oh, there's my father! I have to go. Pleased to have met you. Sister Tilda. Goodbye.\" The princess floated away, a slim tree in full, pink blossom. Tilda watched Clarissa approach a surrey and fine team of horses. Some of the families in Salt Lake were rich. Clarissa stepped up gracefully into her carriage. Unshed tears stung the country girl's eyes. Frank flushed as his glance met hers. He probably was thinking how funny she looked. He might never have noticed that her dress was ugly if Clarissa's pretty one hadn't come along. The city girl had her hair fixed with long, slender curls pinned up in the back. Tilda's wasn't fixed at all?just wound in braids around her head. Tilda wanted to say out loud, \"I'm going to get me store cloth for a dress. It won't be pink, either. I don't like pink. It'll be a lot prettier than Clarissa's.\" Frank wouldn't understand, though. Showing him would be better. \"Got to go,\" Tilda said suddenShe joined her parents outside the meetinghouse door. Walking home with them, she tried to think of some way to get the calico. Home! This one-room dugout! Three years ago Tilda had helped her father spade the square hole into the ground, and securely pound logs on all sides. Across these they had placed roof poles, covered them with vdllows and sod. There was only one door and one vdndow. The floor was of earth, with loose boards laid over it. Tilda followed her parents inside. Mrs. Dawson scraped the ashes on the stone hearth, blew gently on the embers, and spread some chips over the bright glow to get the fire going. This was to take off the chill. A pair of three-legged kettles squatted beside the hearth. The room was furnished with three wooden stools and a hewn table, a corner cupboard, and a bed of poles with a cornhusk mattress. Tilda slept on the lid of the wooden chest opposite the bed. Her mattress was an old comforter doubled; her cover, a buffalo robe. As usual on Sunday, she helped her mother prepare supper. She turned the cold cornmeal mush out of the bowl onto a plate to slice. While she was getting the knife, Tilda noticed that the pen-and-ink sketch of her mother's \"caster\" was dusty. The life-like drawing, pasted on a thin board, stood propped against the earthenware jar on the ledge of stone above the fireplace. When the Dawsons came West, the actual silver caster had been left behind. Long after her parents slept, Tilda lay awake. Yard goods cost a lot. How could she get something to trade at Horrock's store in Og-den for the calico she coveted? Finally the idea came to her. The Burnetts had cut and stacked their wheat. There were always scattered, loose wheat stalks left among the stubble. Tomorrow she'd ask the neighbors if she might glean their field. AT daybreak, Tilda slipped out. Brother Burnett, just up, granted her request at once. \"Why, sure, Tildy. You go right ahead. That's pretty hard work, 'specially after you do all your chores, but you're welcome.\" Tilda hurried home. She gave a little skip through the door. Her parents were eating their hot mush breakfast. ?Ive been over to Brother Burnett's,\" she reported breathlessly. \"He'll let me glean his wheat field. \"I'll do it after my regular chores. Pa. You won't notice the difference.\" He had a spoonful of mush on the way to his mouth. He ate it before he spoke. \"What's all this about?\" \"Some calico. For a dress. Did you see the new girl at meeting? I want some calico like her dress. Only not pink. I'll work 'till Ihave a whole sack of wheat ready to take to town.\" Her father shook his head. \"You'd trade weeks of gleaning, flailing, and winnowing to Hor-rock's, just for yard goods?\" Tilda nodded eagerly. \"You females! What do you want another dress for?\" She gulped in astonishment. \"Why ? a bright, pretty color. Please let me get the wheat, Pa. Please!\" Tilda stood in front of him, her hands clenched so that the knuckles showed white. Her father said, \"You can glean the wheat. But this new dress business?it just ain't seemly.\" Her mother spoke. \"The dresses I make you ain't so bad. Took me nigh a month to spin and weave that cloth for your Sunday dress. And dyed floursack dresses ain't so bad for working.\" \"Oh, everything we've got is so ugly. Ma! Blacks and browns! We look like mudhens. I've got to get calico somehow!\" Her father rose, put on his hat. \"Don't expect any help.\" \"We need variety in eating,\" her mother wished. \"It's mush, mush all the time. If you got a bushel of wheat, we could use some butter. Maybe a little white flour. Or salt pork.\" Tilda choked out, \"I got to have want him to see her close until she something pretty. I got tor was wearing calico. She waved back Her mother said nothing more, brusquely and went on flailing. Her father scuffed through the The following Sunday she told door.

Her full just before supper, Frank Robinson skirt and petticoats were fastened and his grandfather, Bishop Robin up around her thighs, son, rode by. Frank reined up his Frank Robinson wasn't in her horse as if he meant to stop, and mind. Her thoughts were only of waved. Tilda had on her brown, her beautiful wheat, and calico. A flour-sack working dress. She didn't voice came from the road. ?A Howdy, Tilda.\" She jerked upright, clutching at her half-filled apron, and wrenched around. Her skirts swirled above her knees. Her heart first jumped into her throat, then dropped into her shoes. Frank sat there on the slate-colored mare, his long legs dangling. He brushed a lock of black hair from his eyes to see her better, and tried to keep a smile from coming on his mouth. No wonder! She looked her very worst. Breathing quickly, Tilda fumbled to button her waist, which was too far open at the neck. \"I?I didn't aim to scare you.\" Frank's smile came out. Tilda blushed furiously. Her eyes flashed. \"You didn't scare me!\" The words were curt and sharp. \"But you thought you were smart to sneak up on me like an Indian.\" She'd seen him look at her legs when she whirled. And what a sight she must have been stooping 'way over with her back to him! \"Honest, I didn't sneak up.\" His tone begged her not to get any madder at him. \"I was just doing an errand for grandpa and thought I'd pass the time o'day.\" \"Well, you passed it.\" Tilda turned away, being careful not to have her skirts flare out, and resumed gleaning. Now she half knelt as she picked up each wheat stalk. Frank sat still on his horse as if he didn't understand. Humph! After a minute or two he went loping down the road. Tilda crumpled on the ground, her head on her knees. She'd got her legs cut raw, her back nearly broken, her hands looking awful, to get a calico dress so that Frank would think she was as pretty as Clarissa. And how he had just seen her! He had laughed! What difference would a new dress make now? She wiped her hot, teary face with her apron. It was no use. Her conscience would nag her anyway if she had the calico. She'd be thinking of her mother needing a variety of food instead of mush. Tilda stood up listlessly. She would finish gleaning, and thresh and winnow the last of the wheat. Pa could take the sackful to town to trade for something to eat that would be a change. Out here all people did was work to get enough to eat. Tilda saw her mother trudging across the field toward her. She hadn't realized before that ma looked like an old, old woman. She plodded over the stubble as if walking in her sleep. It was from so much hard work. Ma never complained, but neither did she ever seem to take much notice of anything nowadays. Even of that picture of her precious caster set. \"Got the soap a-cooling,\" Mrs. Dawson called. There was no expression in her voice. Automatically she began picking up wheat stalks and stowing them in her apron. \"Thought I'd help you.\" Tenderness stirred Tilda. \"You got no call to do this. Ma. Go back to the dugout and rest yourself a little.\" \"I'm tired of being in there. Nothing else to do but this, for awhile. You? you'll get your wheat to town sooner.\" The lump in Tilda's throat choked her. Ma meant she should TEN MILES TO CALICO 247 get the calico. Ma was on her side. Tilda swallowed hard. Then, with the shock as of cold water thrown in her face, it struck the girl that her mother looked like a squaw. Her skin was lined and weatherbeaten, her dark hair lifeless. Her arms were thin and sinewy. Her hands resembled leathery claws. That stoop in ma's back came from bending, lifting, washing, laboring all the time. The one variety in her life was going to meeting on Sunday, seeing other tired, worn women like herself trying to keep awake during the sermon. Ma had grown old at thirty-five. Tilda thought, Fm past sixteen. How much longer will I stay young looking? She was awful tired right now. She might wear out even quicker than her mother. Oh, she musn't let herself get like ma! Whether or not Frank liked her in the calico didn't matter so much. She had to get it so she wouldn't wither up as her mother had done. Desperately, Tilda resumed her gleaning. That night her father asked if her task wouldn't soon be finished. He hadn't mentioned her work since she started. Why had he asked that? Rather worriedly she answered, \"Yes.\" 'I?ll get you a piece of twine to tie the sack. You maybe'll have over a bushel. Still set on the dress goods?\" More worried, she replied, \"Yes, sir, and thanks for the twine.\" Her father said nothing more, but the room seemed brighter to Tilda. Perhaps pa had joined her side. No doubt his interest was because she had worked hard. He always admired a hard worker. Tuesday afternoon Tilda worked at her threshing with a light heart. Thump! Thump! Went the flail. This was the very last batch of wheat stalks?she wouldn't mind how her back hurt. Her mother came from the dugout with a bucket of water. Tilda let the flail drop. She sat down against a stump to ease her backache. \"Seems like you'll 'most kill yourself just for a dress,\" her mother said, setting the bucket beside her. Tilda wiped her forehead with her forearm. She reached for the bucket. \"Thanks, Ma.\" She drank long and washed her hot, red face with the remaining water. She smiled up at her mother. \"It's sure nice wheat.\" \"Come winter you'll wish you'd got something heavier than calico.\" But Tilda sensed that her mother didn't really mean it. The sparrows were gathering near the tarpaulin. Tilda took her flipper and a stone from the top of the stump. She placed the pebble in the leather piece and pulled the elastics back until the two rubbers fastened to the sides of the fork were taut. Without aiming, she shot the missile toward the birds. They whirred away and Tilda replaced the flipper on the stump. \"Makes no difference if there is a bounty on the pesky sparrows,\" she said. \"I can't seem to want to kill 'em.\" Painfully she got to her feet. Her mother picked up the bucket and remarked, \"You don't have to get done tonight.\" \"Yes I do. I'm going to take my wheat to town tomorrow.\" \"To trade just for calico?when you could get?\" \n\nHer mother checked the wish, shadows shd over the surrounding Tilda flushed and glanced down at mountains. The last operation, her dull-brown, sage-dyed, flour sifting, required little time. Finally sack dress. The waist was opened she shoveled the sieved grain into at the neck to where the gentle the fat sack. Before tying the swelling of her firm young breasts mouth with the heavy twine her began. She drew a sobbing breath, father had provided, she ran her lifted the flail, and thumped the fingers down into the wheat caress-wheat stalks at her feet emphatical ingly.

Laughter and friends. I Remember? Elder Rodney B. Taylor \n\nCorrected OCR Transcription\nRECENTLY while attending a reception in a Utah community, the discussion of the Women's Clubs came up. It seemed that most of the matrons present belonged to at least one club and some to more than one. These women were sort of the town's \"four hundred,\" and spent considerable time discussing the merits and demerits of their respective clubs. Previously, a member of one had referred to another club as the \"tea drinkers' club.\"\nThis sort of split the community wide open, and at this gathering the crack had not entirely closed. These women were considered good Latter day Saints, and I wondered why more of them did not give vent to their energies through the Relief Society, my pet organization of the Church. They seemed to crave excitement or glamour and to consider the Relief Society a little, should I say, too sedate for them.\nIn reading our Church history, one is particularly impressed by the number of doleful, mournful experiences our people passed through, leaving one to wonder if they ever had any pleasure or joy?and so with Relief Society. I don't believe the Society puts its \"best foot forward.\" Let me tell you about one of the times when it entertained Nobility, and said, 'Let there be a feast,' and there was a feast.\"\nWhile I don't profess to remember way back when knighthood was\nrecall the tail end of the Gay Nineties. Much has been written about the American way of life during this time, but, as Mormons, I suppose we were so busy cutting sagebrush, digging ditches and killing the snakes, that there was not anything very gay about it for us. However, this was not the case up in a little Mormon community in Canada. I'll never forget mother trying to dress up to look like a Gibson Girl!\nWe had only been up there a few, short years, and had succeeded in establishing an outpost of civilization; it was just a year or two before the turn of the century.\nMost of the saints made this eight-hundred-mile trek by wagon train in quest of land. A few were called by the Church to colonize this prairie, and, rather hurriedly, others joined them.\nFor those who came in quest of land their every wish was satisfied. The prairie spread out for hundreds of miles with not a fence in sight. It was all covered with luxuriant wild hay. Why the grass grew so high that I, as a boy, couldn't find a bare spot on which to play marbles. Prowled up, this land would produce sixty bushels of wheat per acre; however some years we would have a drought, wouldn't raise anything. Most of us, coming from Utah, were irrigation-minded, and so we set about digging a canal and making an irrigation system. Nowadays we get the money from Government and call it a project; but in those days we had to do it ourselves, and we didn't have much with which to do it. Page 208 I REMEMBER 209 It was the first irrigation system in Canada, and caused favorable comments for us, as a people, throughout the country. This was indeed welcome as we had been followed by much ugly rumor from Utah.\nShortly after the completion of the canal, the bishopric received a letter saying that a person of noble lineage, who was also a very high Government official (actually a real English Lord) had condescended to pay us a visit ostensibly to inspect the canal, however we had a pretty good idea that we, as a people, would be scrutinized. At any rate, we were indeed thrilled at the thought of entertaining His Lordship.\nOf course every privilege has its responsibilities. There was the problem of entertaining His Lordship which was brought very vividly to our attention by a little English doctor, recently from England, and who was about the only gentleman in our midst. While the saints bragged of having an M.D., it sort of had a hollow ring to us. It seems in those days, when an English boy graduated from a medical school, he invariably went to the colonies to \"practice\" on the colonials for a couple of years before returning to England to establish his profession. We knew we served more or less as guinea pigs to him, but we also knew that he was better than no doctor at all.\nUpon hearing of His Lordship's intended visit, the little doctor was more or less terrified at the thought of us entertaining him. He knew only too well that our facilities for such an occasion were somewhat limited.\nThere were about fifty houses in the town, some of them being sod. There were also three business houses, a little general store, a blacksmith shop and?you would never guess the other so I'll tell you?a millinery shop! My father ran the general store; he used to advertise everything from candles to coffins but there wasn't much in the store. He used to make the coffins \"on order\" and I used to dread hearing of someone dying of pneumonia or being drowned to death by a horse, because it meant an all-night vigil for me, holding a light by which father might see to build the coffin. He had learned the carpenter trade working on the Manti Temple before going to Canada, so bending and gluing boards, lining them with white satin inside, and white figured plush outside, and mounting the silver handles seemed to be no effort for him. But as for me, I'd get sleepy and let the light fall over, and sometimes the chimney would fall off and smash on the floor?not only that, but the next day I'd be so sleepy I could not go to the funeral. The funeral was something not to be missed in a country where nothing ever happened except snow, wind, wheat blizzards and more wind. Among the bishopric they owned a pair of beautiful black percheron stallions imported from France. In the event of a funeral, they would be hitched together to draw the hearse. It was an inspiring sight. Sometimes right in the procession they would get in a fight, but several sharp cracks of the bishop's whip would fix them. It was a sight not to be missed by any boy.\nAnd now for the millinery store. It seems the sisters could put up with sod houses, wind, snow, and mud, but they must have their hats. In those days a hat really meant something. A man's standing in the community might be judged by the number and quality of the ostrich plumes in his wife's hat. So you see, hats were important. Hence the millinery shop on this outpost of civilization held a high place.\nMother used to keep her hat on the highest shelf in the house, totalling two or each of us youngsters. About twice a year she made a trip to the hat shop to have the artificial fruit updated, the moths killed in the ostrich feathers, and perhaps a little bunch of flowers added. After a few years of this the hat was indescribable. When mother would reach up and get that hat down, we youngsters knew something big was \"brewing,\" perhaps a long trip, a visit by a General Board member from Salt Lake City or, in this case, Nobility.\nAs the day for the reception drew near, the little doctor became a little more panicky. The millinery store became more a beehive of activity. The bishopric contented itself with writing the speech of welcome.\nThe speech of welcome, we considered a masterpiece. Nearly everyone in town having had a hand in writing it. It started out by saying how proud we were to be residents (not citizens) of Canada (most of us were homesick for Utah). Then it continued by telling His Lordship in a roundabout way what fine people we were, and ended by asking him for a telegraph line, a railroad, a bridge across the St. Mary's River, and a schoolhouse. It was deemed wise not to ask him for too much at one time.\nInasmuch as the doctor spoke very good \"Oxford English,\" it was decided he should read the speech of welcome. Not only that, but the doctor owned a pair of highstepping English hackneys coach horses, and a rubber-tired rig. It was a luxurious outfit to be sure. So it was decided to have the doctor and his wife represent the official welcoming committee.\nI might add that this pair of hackneys were fed from seed cold oats in slats in the roof of the hayloft. Their water was equally high, consequently their necks grew straight up. When traveling their heads were very much erect. Should they have been turned out to pasture they would have starved, as they couldn't get their heads down to the level of the grass. I suspect the little doctor of importing these horses to impress upon us that, after all, we were just \"colonials.\"\nNevertheless, I, as a boy, tried checking up the load of my deliveries to see if I could look like the doctor's horses but I didn't accomplish much. The first trip out he fell down and broke the shafts of my delivery wagon.\nThe bishopric in those days was our police department, fire department, judge, jury and all, rolled into one. They gave the orders and we followed them out as best we could. We knew that inasmuch as the bishopric had brought us through this far, they would have no trouble in entertaining an English Lord. The really hard part of the reception, that is the giving of the banquet, was turned over to the Relief Society. Mother used to say it seemed no that when a job became too big for the bishopric, they turned it over to the Relief Society sisters.\nThe next few days drifted rather quietly along. The sisters checked their respective silverware and table linens. The bishopric put the finishing touches on the speech of welcome. The doctor and his two hackneys clipped and groomed to a state of perfection. Then another letter came saying that not only was His Lordship coming, he would be accompanied by his two beautiful daughters. To the bishopric this just meant the setting of two more plates; however, Father Bill, to realize the repercussions the news would cause among the sisters.\nFrom reading English newspapers, the sisters knew full well the two ladies in question. They were the \"toast of the Empire\" and had been entertained extensively in the stately halls of Europe?Paris, Vienna?and other parts of the world. And further, the sisters felt that they would be met and would not face them in their present wardrobes, shabby from the trip to Canada.\nAfter considerable tumult, meager savings were dug up, livestock sold, and a messenger was dispatched posthaste to the nearest city to replenish our stocks of apparel. The millinery shakes were long since bare.\nDressing up mother in those days was some job. Nearly every member of the family would help. There was the matter of the skirt, a much pleated, folded, voluminous affair of many layers. Mother, being the wife of the Store Owner who was also a High Councilman, had to dress like part. In this case she had gained a few pounds, and waist lines were supposed to be very small. We fit her to the dress, which was a simple matter. She meekly went without her dinner and then, by holding her breath and wiggling a few times while father drew the corset strings taut, we got her down to a size where she could get into her dress and the \"Gibson Girl\" effect. But some of the sisters required a complete new outfit.\nFor the few days before the big event, the town was a bedlam of activity. But the day before His Lordship's arrival found everything in readiness. Table linens all pressed, silverware highly polished, and wardrobes in tiptop shape. The place of meeting was the only large house in town, and, by opening some doors, two rooms could be made into one.\nAfter the banquet, the plans called, for the townspeople to drop by in twos and threes to meet the party. After which, the doctor would drive them and the bishopric on an inspection tour of the canal. At long last, we were ready.\nEarly the next morning, the sisters could be seen converging on the reception house from all directions, carrying food, silverware, linen, flowers, dishes, and even furniture! It looked like a gala day except for the fact that a strong north wind had sprung up, which immediately was followed by a thunderous downpour of rain.\nThe rain being very flat, soon there were floods, and after a couple of hours of this deluge, the countryside took on the aspects of the Pacific Ocean. Every few blocks in this prairie were buffalo wallows, and, when wet, they were bottomless pits for a carriage. We began to realize that all our plans and preparations were all for naught if it did not stop raining, when up drew a carriage bearing some Church officials, members of a General Board from Utah. This sort of complicated things for the sisters, but at least if the rain did not abate, there would be someone to eat up this feast. Needless to say these Church officials were very pleasantly surprised, if not awestruck, when they came in and beheld this banquet room resplendent with gleaming white linen, highly polished silverware, the most delicate and lovely chinaware decorated with wild flowers, and at the end of the table a beautiful red plush chair standing. It was sort of a sentinel for all that was grand. I never knew that such things existed. Needless to say being a boy I was not privileged to try it out. Some sister evidently had smuggled that chair through from Salt Lake in the back of a covered wagon, perhaps unknown to her husband. Now here it stood in all its glory surrounded by a wilderness, waiting the touch of Nobility. As the morning drew on, the storm grew in intensity and assumed proportions of a cloudburst, and we began to realize that our chances of shaking the hand of Nobility were very slim indeed. By noon, the skies seemed to split wide open, the rain fell in sheets and the whole countryside was swimming. Luckily, we had these Church officials with us, and in those days they were always hungry, so that all our efforts wouldn't be wasted. Shortly after noon, we had several more terrific claps of thunder and the wind and rain continued. The bishopric went into a huddle with the Relief Society president. After all the dinner was ready to be served, it seemed the Relief Society, too, had a weakness for visiting General Board members, and Nobility or no Nobility, the dinner was served. Occupying the brilliant red plush chair in all his splendor was the bishop. He was flanked by his counselors, the Church officials, and a few prominent townspeople. Judging by the appetites of these visiting churchmen, they must have been on the road quite some time and perhaps traveling without purse or scrip. Eventually, the dinner was all eaten up, the sisters were congratulated on being such good cooks, after which the organ was rolled out and the brethren sang a few songs. However, having just partaken of such a sumptuous repast, they soon all settled down in chairs. The room echoed to their hymn \"All Is Well, All Is Well\" accompanied by the gentle patter of rain on the windows. The brethren were soon drowsy and some cat napping. It was a peaceful scene to behold indeed-\"All Is Well, All Is Well\" with the exception of one little lively girl of 'perhaps eight years with long spindly legs, who was upstairs, downstairs, hither, thither and yon all at the same time, followed by her two pigtails. I Remember 213 ON one of her numerous trips, she happened, by chance, to look out the window, and wheeled and screamed?\"The Lord is coming, he's coming, he's coming?and he is bringing the whole British Army with him.\"\nInstantly the whole house seemed to be electrified?British Army, British Army, the Lord?rain?mud?no dinner?these murmurs seemed to permeate the very atmosphere of the room. At this time His Lordship's appearance would be distracting enough, but a British Army besides, in fact any army, would be most unwelcome.\nThe saints swarmed to the windows, and sure enough coming across those golden, rain-soaked prairies, was a large body of horsemen. They were surely but slowly making their way straight for the house.\nOnly a few minutes previous, observing the bishop \"enthroned\" on that red plush chair, I had decided that when I grew up I wanted to be a bishop?but he was now a very distracted figure, which somewhat dampened my ardor?and the rest of the men looked as if their dinners had turned to lead.\nEventually, the party drew up on the front lawn?preceded by the little doctor bearing the speech of welcome, who took up his prearranged post on the porch.\nHis Lordship was thoroughly chilled and soaked and had to be pried out of the saddle, and he stomped into the house right past the doctor, speech of welcome and all.\nHis Lordship's beautiful daughters did not fare much better. He looked like two hens who had been out in the rain all night and were more to be pitied than envied.\nIt seemed that back at His Lordship's starting point that morning, Canadian officials had tried, in the face of such threatening weather, to prevail upon His Lordship not to attempt the trip, but he had merely shrugged his shoulders and inferred that the punctuality of the British Aristocracy was a thing not to be trifled with, and go he would, also his daughters.\nSince a carriage would probably have stalled, they were all mounted. In normal weather an honor guard of perhaps twelve Royal Canadian Mounted Police would have accompanied persons of such lineage, but in this case the guard was not only doubled but trebled. We were indeed relieved to learn that \"the whole British Army\" had turned out to be mostly \"Mounties\" whom we had learned to know as protectors. As a boy, when I used to see one coming in his scarlet red coat I thought of all the bad things I'd ever done.\nThe Indians around us were taught that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were the sons of the \"Great White Father\" (King of England) and if they displeased the Mounties, the \"Great White Father\" would wreak vengeance on their heads.\nAt this point, to use a military phrase, the Relief Society \"took over.\" They immediately discerned that what His Lordship and ladies needed most was to get warm and have their coats and other clothes dried. They went into a huddle, and after a few hurried whispers they would now go to work with clocklike precision. Several slipped out the back door and began catching, killing, and frying chicken as they have never done before or since. Youngsters were sent around town to spread the alarm that we were all caught \"flat footed.\" Other sisters set about drying His Lordship's tunic. Imagine the thrill the sisters in this outpost of civilization must have received in carefully untangling and drying the gold braid with which it was draped. One of the bishopric was dispatched posthaste to my father's store to see if, perchance, there was anything left in it after the previous dinner. He came in the store all excited and said, 'The Lord has come and there is not a bite in the house to eat! Have you anything?\" My father replied, \"Well I'm not surprised. I've been preaching for years if we were not more careful, the Savior would be dropping in on us and our lamps would be empty, and now this?\" They went over the store shelves and discovered seventeen cans of oysters. They were stocked in the store for such occasions as wedding receptions, visiting apostles, or, in this case. Nobility. They were so expensive it was considered next door to sacrilege to use them for anything else. The Mounties dismounted and we turned their horses, all fifty head, into the host's haystacks. At least they were going to be well fed. The sisters hurriedly summoned Brother Fofalite, an Italian convert, a very fine musician and our choir leader. It was common knowledge about the town that the bishopric was not any too well pleased with Brother Fofalite?it was thought that he had the choir spend too much time on operatic arias and neglected such good old hymns as \"Come, Come Ye Saints\" and \"High On the Mountain Tops.\" Nevertheless, Brother Fofalite was an expert musician, but in twenty years of farming, he was never known to raise a crop. The sisters soon had the banquet room again in order. With the splendor of the Mounties and their scarlet red uniforms, the atmosphere of the room took on a tone of brilliance. Eventually, His Lordship and Ladies regained their composure. Brother Fofalite appeared and accompanied on the organ a quartette of the sisters who sang, artistically, several difficult operatic renditions with which the Noble Party was very much surprised. Following this the town's \"Oomph Girl\" (yes, we had them in those days, too) sang a song in \"rag time\" which immensely pleased the Mounties, but evidently passed clear over His Lordship's head. By this time the rain having subsided, once more the sisters began converging on the banquet house from all parts of town, bringing even more dishes, furniture, and food. My admiration certainly went out to the Relief Society sisters, even though I knew full well we'd probably be on a mush and milk diet for the rest of the summer. The dinner was served in excellent style. The whole party was enthusiastically pleased with its reception \"at the hands of the Mormons.\" The storm lifted and they were shown the canal and sent happily on their way. Thus the Mormons in Canada were judged and came through with flying colors. Thanks to the Relief Society and all seventeen cans of oysters, the day was saved, and we all lived happily ever afterwards. Mysteriously, that red plush chair was never seen again from that day to this."

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES A Seminary Relief Society RAY L. JONES, principal of the Midway L. D. S. Seminary at Lewisville, Idaho, is giving seminary students an insight into the operation of Church auxiliaries by organizing the students into groups patterned after the auxiliaries. His account of the sample Relief Society in the seminary during the 1943-44 school year states: \"The organization has consisted of three girls?a president chosen from the Church history class, a first counselor from the New Testament class, and a second counselor from the Old Testament class. The purpose of this organization has been threefold: 1. To acquaint all seminary students with the purpose and value of the Relief Society; 2. To give students opportunities to serve their fellow classmates; 3. To train student officers for future leadership in the Relief Societies of their wards and stakes. \"The principal project carried out by this organization during the past year has been the writing of letters to the servicemen from the five wards of the school district. These letters have included the following features: 1. A mimeographed letter from the Relief Society officers; 2. News from the high school, home wards, and from the boys in the service; 3. A message from the stake presidency, ward bishopric, and the high school principal; 4. Personal notes written on the back and margins of the mimeographed letter by seminary students. \"The first letter was mailed, in November (1943), to 150 servicemen, the second, in February, to more than 200, and the third letter, in May. Dozens of letters have been received from the servicemen expressing their appreciation for being remembered. These replies have come from all parts of the United States and from the battle fronts of the world, including India, North Africa, Italy, England, the Aleutians, and the South Pacific. The student Relief Society officers have organized and supervised all phases of this letter-writing project, and in addition have carried out the following activities: 1. Sent get-well cards to students who have been absent because of sickness; 2. Sent sympathy cards to students who have had a death in the family; 3. Written or visited sick students in hospitals; 4. Suggested and assisted in making beautification improvements in the seminary building; 5. Regularly cared for the potted plants, goldfish, et cetera; Page  Presidency of the sample Relief Society of the Midway L. D. S.

Assisted in the seminary graduation by arranging flowers for decorating the chapel, assisting the girls with corsages, et cetera.\" Juarez Stake (Mexico) \"NELLIE S. HATCH, president of Juarez Stake Relief Society, wrote in 1944: \"Our Mexican Branch in Colonia Dublan, a Spanish-speaking organization consisting of forty-two members, takes several Magazine subscriptions, an indication of the progress these sisters are making in learning the English language. The Mexican Branch has found other ways also of demonstrating its interest in Relief Society work, and of extending and increasing its usefulness and spirit of charity. When a young woman was left a widow with six small children, they drew from a fund that had been accumulating, and acting with and under the direction of the bishop, the woman was placed in a home where she could care for her small children, work was found for the oldest girl, to supplement what the mother earns by taking work into the home, and a simple but secure living was thus provided for one who had been unfortunate and dependent. 'The Pacheco Ward, a small and isolated community in the mountains, has also been diligent and forward looking. A few years ago it began accumulating material that would be needed in times of emergency and stress, and to create this initial fund each sister donated to the Society one hectoliter of com (approximately one bushel). Some of the husbands caught the spirit and added to this. The aggregate donation amounted to 50 hectoliters of corn which was stored until planting time. Each year some of the seed was planted, but always a sufficient amount was reserved for food, in case the need arose, and was not sold or rented out for planting until another crop was secure. But the annual turnover and increase of this basic donation has netted the Society each year a fair profit which has been converted into staple articles; such as cloth, thread, salt, soda, medicines, et cetera, until, at the end of 1943, there was an estimated value of merchandise on hand of $1,525, and of medicines to the value of $115,000, all of which is held for times of emergency. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 951 These three women are sisters, and at the time this picture was submitted, last August, all three were serving as ward Relief Society presidents. They are: Viola P. Zwahlen, then president (but since released) of Bountiful Second Ward Relief Society, South Davis Stake, and formerly president of the Castle Dale Ward Relief Society, Emery Stake; Dora P. Ellis, president of the Ellensburg (Washington) Branch Relief Society, Northwestern States Mission, and formerly of the Wellington Ward Relief Society, Carbon Stake; and Adrian P. Hanson, then president (but since released) of Delta Second Ward Relief Society, Deseret Stake. Picture submitted by Leola Jensen of Perron (Emery Stake), Utah. \"In addition to this the members have on hand a ton of potatoes for sale, the growing of which was done through a project they instigated and with which the entire community helped. One hundred kilos of seed potatoes were donated to them by an interested and enthusiastic potato farmer who not only gave them the seed but planted them, cared for them during the summer as well, and turned them over to them in the fall with their increased supply. All but what was needed for food was saved for seed and planted in the spring of 1943. To take care of the planting as well as the harvesting, a town work-day was called and all turned out, and the Relief Society served dinners for them on both occasions. Again the potatoes not actually needed for food were saved for seed, and money raised in this way is continuing to add to the fund already started.\" Big Horn Stake (Wyoming) OULDA M. LYNN, Big Horn Stake Relief Society president, sent to the General Board one of the attractive wall calendars distributed by the Lovell West Ward Relief Society to all women of the ward. Printed in brown on buff paper, each leaf of the calendar is headed \"Lovell West Ward Relief Society\" with an accompanying statement in red: \"Relief Society is an Open Door to Enlightened, Ennobled Living.\" The Tuesdays on this calendar have no dates, but instead, printed in red, are the Relief Society meeting days, the first Tuesday iridicated by \"Theology\"; the second, \"Work\"; the third, \"Literature\"; and the fourth, \"Social Science\". The fifth Tuesday in January is designated \"Special Program\"; the fifth Tuesday in May, \"Closing Social\"; and the fifth Tuesday in October, \"Special Work Day\". During the four summer months, only the monthly work meeting on the second Tuesday is indicated in red, accompanied by the words \"Visiting Teacher\" inasmuch as during these months no training-report meetings are held on the first Tuesday, but reports are made on the second Tuesday. Tableau staged for the ward homecoming, September 12, 1944, by the Relief Society of the Boise (Idaho) Second Ward, depicting the many activities in which the Society participates. On a backdrop of blue satin the Society's motto \"Charity Never Faileth\" was lettered in gold. Grouped on either side of the stage were the Singing Mothers led by Gladys Broadbent and accompanied by Verda Peterson. Welfare work and sewing was represented by Counselor Gladys Cain, Mabel Sorenson and Belle Borup; Eva Robison and Mildred Kane were in the white uniforms of the Red Cross surgical dressings division; Edythe Mathews and Counselor Mary E. Lund represented the Red Cross canteen corps. Magazine representative, Irene Read, was ready with receipt book to take a subscription for TheSecretary Elizabeth Nokelby was writing the minutes and President Suza P. Nielson was seated at her desk presiding over the activities. Across the front of the stage a bright border of cans brought to mind the summer canning project and gave those who participated the satisfaction of time well spent. \"Opening Social\" is the red-letter day on the last Tuesday of September, and a \"Bazaar\" in capital letters is scheduled for the second Tuesday in December. The final red-letter Tuesday of the year is \"Christmas\". Lovell West Ward is commended for its enterprising use of this means of keeping Relief Society constantly before the women of the ward, which should result in increased attendance not only because the members themselves can better plan their work and appointments so as not to conflict with Relief Society meetings and socials, but because the Society also had to plan its work systematically for the entire year before the calendar could be printed. This calendar on the wall serves not only as a constant reminder but as a standing invitation to Relief Society. Sofe Johnson is president of this ward Relief Society.

Lund represented the Red Cross canteen corps. Magazine representative, Irene Read, was ready with receipt book to take a subscription for TheSecretary Elizabeth Nokelby was writing the minutes and President Suza P. Nielson was seated at her desk presiding over the activities. Across the front of the stage a bright border of cans brought to mind the summer canning project and gave those who participated the satisfaction of time well spent. \"Opening Social\" is the red-letter day on the last Tuesday of September, and a \"Bazaar\" in capital letters is scheduled for the second Tuesday in December. The final red-letter Tuesday of the year is \"Christmas\". Lovell West Ward is commended for its enterprising use of this means of keeping Relief Society constantly before the women of the ward, which should result in increased attendance not only because the members themselves can better plan their work and appointments so as not to conflict with Relief Society meetings and socials, but because the Society also had to plan its work systematically for the entire year before the calendar could be printed. This calendar on the wall serves not only as a constant reminder but as a standing invitation to Relief Society. Sofe Johnson is president of this ward Relief Society.

            "content": "Look Unto the Rock, Whence Ye Are Hewn\" Elder Daryl Chase Director of Latter-day Saint Institute, Logan, Utah IN recent years we have had many reappraisals of our national history. Since the outbreak of war, with all of its cost in treasure and lives, Americans have been attempting to evaluate democracy and discover how we reached our present national position of power from the simple, tragic beginnings of Jamestown and Plymouth of three hundred years ago.\nAmerican history is being rewritten in the agony of our present suffering and in the hope which we cherish of a better world. This does not mean that any significant changes will be made in our dates of history. Children will give the same answers as their grandfathers did regarding such questions as, \"When was America discovered? How many sailed on the Mayflower?\" etc.\nOn the other hand, better answers to the questions which follow must be made by young Americans than were made by their fathers, if we are to build on the political and spiritual foundations of Jamestown and Plymouth. I refer to such questions as these: What were the driving motives of the early American colonizers? What were the basic political ideals back of the instruments of government established by them? Can the marked differences which are apparent between the Spanish and English settlers in the New World be explained by the accidents of discovery (by the direction the wind happened to blow their ships), or must these differences be accounted for by factors quite outside the category of winds, rivers, harbors, and precious metals?\nAt the present time, there is a definite shift on the part of the interpreters of America's past from their emphasis on her material strength to that of her spiritual heritage. This shift is definitely in the direction of historical accuracy, and at the same time will serve as a morale builder to all thoughtful citizens. Men do not want to suffer or die, merely to shift a border or to keep their country the richest nation on earth.\nIt seems to the writer that it would be well for Latter-day Saint historians and Church interpreters of the past to follow the current trend of our secular historians and rewrite much of our early Church history with a shift in emphasis upon the purely religious and spiritual heritage of the saints.\nA Latter-day Saint student may know the exact dates and places of every important event in Church history and remain quite ignorant of the real significance of the past to him. I once had a supervisor visit my class and demonstrate \"how to teach Church history. The period lasted fifty minutes, and the whole time was spent in teaching the students the exact distance from Palmyra to the Smith farm. I think that all readers of this article will agree that a few minutes spent on the geographical setting of the Smith farmstead would have been time well spent, but the major part of that 50-minute period should have been occupied, not in pointing out how far the Prophet was from New York City, but rather how close he was to God.\nChronologies and assembled quotations from past leaders will never supply sufficient spiritual nutriment for the growing youth of any age. And at the present time, when the basic beliefs and practices of the Latter-day Saints are being attacked at home and abroad, the student is forced far below the surface of history when he attempts to protect the Church, or when he searches the past for some meaning of the present or for guidance into the future.\nAS I reflect upon the early history of the Church, several very important facts emerge from all the names and dates and geography associated with our beginnings. One is this: The Restored Church is very young. Many great and worthwhile achievements have already been made to the everlasting credit of the Church, but this fact still remains: One hundred and fifteen years is a very short time in the life of a vital, growing institution, and every Latter-day Saint should be aware of this important fact of his history.\nYoung men and women are delighted to learn that everything has not been done for them either in the Church or in the nation. It is thrilling to everyone to help build a beautiful ward or stake house or temple, but good janitors and watchmen of any structure are very difficult to find because such work is dull and uninteresting. Young people can become very enthusiastic about contributing to a young church (which we are), but may remain quite indifferent to a call merely to protect an old institution.\nI can never read very far in Church history without feeling that we are still in our beginnings, that only the foundation stones have been laid for this spiritual structure which we call the Church, and I am sure that many Latter-day Saints share this point of view with me. I once asked a brilliant young college teacher why he was converted to the Church what it was that first attracted him to Mormonism. He replied that first, it was the good lives of several Latter-day Saints whom he knew that did appeal and second, it was the attractive fact that this Church is young and is on the offensive, whereas the church which he grew up in was very old and was merely living on the material and spiritual resources of an ancient past. He said: \"I am a Mormon; I can help build a future with my faith, my education, and my talents; here is a young, living organism; in the church I left I felt that the best I could do was to protect an ancient monument.\"\nWhen we look below the surface of our beginning, we soon discover another fact: We are not only very young, but, like the Primitive Church, the people who first gathered in eastern New York and northern Ohio to make the new covenant, were among the lowly when judged by their material possessions. The Church started rich in things of the spirit, but very poor in the wealth of this world.\nPractically all material assets of the Church on which we can depend today, cannot be traced beyond the tithing of President Grant. A few men of wealth from 1830 down to the present time have joined the Church, but most of the converts, foreign and domestic, have answered the description Paul made of the early Christian converts at Corinth: \"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called\" (I Cor. 1:26).\nWe misread the story of Plymouth if we place any motive above those of religion and civil liberty as the driving force back of the Pilgrim migration. Many motives may have been back of our forefathers joining the Church, but paramount among them all were the convictions that they were entering the kingdom of God, that Christ's Church was restored upon the earth. They were primarily in search of spiritual riches, and any other interpretations of our early history are distorted and badly unbalanced.\nYear by year, we increase our number of public buildings and our corporate wealth. The youth of the Church and all new converts inherit the fruits of the industry and frugality of the pioneer saints. But to the kingdom seekers of the present we have little to offer of a nonmaterial nature which was not present in the Church as the Founders gathered\nings at Kirtland, Ohio, and Jackson County, Missouri. In that early poverty the elders could say to the investigator: \"Repent of your sins, exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and we will baptize you for the remission of your sins and lay hands on your head for the reception of the Holy Ghost.\" At that early period when they were so poor in this world's goods, the elders could also say: \"Through the power of the priesthood which has been restored, you can make covenants with the Lord which are mortality which, if kept faithfully, will be binding in the worlds to come.\"\nOur assurance of immortality is firmly based upon the same evidence which attracted the first converts; our concepts pertaining to the nature of God and the meaning of life are the rich heritage of a not-too-distant past.\nIn the Nauvoo period when the Church was about fourteen years old, Sidney Rigdon, in reminiscing over the first few months of the Church, said:\nI recollect in the year 1830 I met the whole Church of Christ in a little old log house about 20 feet square, near Waterloo, N.Y., and we began to talk about the kingdom of God as if we had the world at our command. We talked with great confidence, and talked big things, although we were not many people.\nWe had big feelings.\nWe knew fourteen years ago that the Church would become as large as it is today. We were as big then as we ever shall be. We began to talk like men in authority and power. We looked upon the men of the earth as grasshoppers. (D.H.C. Vol. VI, p. 288.)\nThe great plans (which we have partly achieved) which the early brothers and sisters made in their rude cabins, the sureness of their position, their faith in the ultimate triumph of their work wit' all centered in spiritual realities which challenged the best within them. The prevailing spirit of that early period was: What can I contribute to this cause? There was neither social prestige nor corporate wealth to attract the investigator until quite recent times.\nTo repeat: The Church began very poor in the goods of this world but very rich in the treasures of the spirit.\nTHERE are some churches which verge on being downright anti-intellectual; they oppose, or view with suspicion, all steps forward in science and art. There are many churches which may not be classified as anti-educational but, in the main, they are indifferent towards learning in general. Intellectuality of any kind does not reflect the spirit of their gospel. The thoughtful observer can plainly see that the trend of modern life everywhere is to move farther and farther away from that type of institution.\nEveryone acquainted with current Latter-day Saint history knows something about the fine schools which the Church has built, and that most of the Church activities can be placed under the general heading of education. This fact holds true whether one considers the programs outlined for the priesthood quorums and the Relief Society, or those which are planned for the little children and the youth of the Church. Some critics admit that the Church is now very interested in education, but suggest that what was true in the past was\nsition by the national trend for universal education as a safeguard to American democracy.\nEvery Latter-day Saint who has read his early history with care knows that early records to which everyone must refer show that Joseph Smith and many of the early saints had very little formal schooling, but the same records also show that they had great faith in what we now call the educational process, accepting its divine approval and extending its influence beyond the grave. It is a plain fact of history that from the very beginning of the Church, education and salvation have gone hand in hand in the restored gospel plan of exaltation.\nTo say that Joseph Smith was zealous for education is not a rhetorical phrase written to please the ears of present-day, cultivated Latter-day Saints who take pride in their schools and educational programs; it is a simple unadorned fact. At this point let us recall just one of the many statements of the Lord given to Joseph Smith pertaining to education, at a time when the problems of food, clothing, and shelter were daily, pressing problems to most of the saints: \"Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand\" (Doc. and Cov. 88:78).\nFurthermore, the Prophet's interest in education did not stop with oral utterances; He was an eager student to the hour of his death. He kept the best educated members of the Church close to him; he was not LOOK UNTO THE ROCK 199 afraid of their learning; they were his resource men and counselors. Recently in a class where we were studying the life of the Prophet, a student asked this question with evident surprise: \"It states in Josiah Quincy's account of his visit to Nauvoo that the Prophet read from his Hebrew Old Testament in order to make a certain theological point clear; how did he happen to know Hebrew?\" The correct answer, of course, is obvious: he learned it the way all men learn Hebrew; he employed a good teacher (Professor Seixas, the best Hebrew scholar of his day) and he sat in a beginner's class and \"sweat it out\" with the other brethren who were also eager to learn. It is one thing to utter a pulpit exhortation about the necessity of learning; it is quite a different thing to spend your money to employ a teacher and then burn the midnight oil over a Hebrew grammar in addition to doing the laborious, daily-routine, executive business of the Church. The Prophet set a good example before his people in attending classes and in organizing schools, but the most important of all his contributions in this field was the close association which he always made between education and the most sacred teachings and activities of his life. Many times we quote the following in support of education, quite unaware that it is found in the dedicatory prayer given by revelation, uttered by the Prophet at the completion of the Kirtland Temple: And do thou grant, Holy Father, that all those who shall worship in this house may be taught words of wisdom out of the best books, and that they may seek learning even by study, and also by faith....\" (Doc. And Gov. 109:14). Apparently, education of the people and temple building were inseparable in the Prophet's mind. In the plans which he proposed for the temple to be built at Far West, one finds that two of its three stories were to be reserved for educational activities. (Comprehensive History of the Church, Vol. 1, p. 440.) The Latter-day Saint student who reads the early history of his Church and does not discover how eager the founders were to raise up a learned generation unto the Lord, have missed an important fact, and a very stimulating one. Emerson said that \"Every institution is but the length and shadow of a man.\" A careful reader of early Church history will learn that the length and shadow of Mormonism is not that of any man limited by the rough life of the American frontier. Rather, it is the length and shadow of the Son of man who placed man's limitations only within the bounds of truth and righteousness."

HARDY (Died March 7, 1945) ALL who knew him have praised his goodness, his kindliness, as much as they have his love for right. Bearing testimony of the truth of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was his great passion. Called as he was to go to the South Sea Islands to give the gospel to the Polynesian people, he not only spent one period of his youth among them, but three times was he called by the Church to go to that people. That which made the people understand the light and beauty of his message was the manner in which it was put forth. In their traditions we find their ancestors believing in God the Creator of heaven and earth, and Page 200 man created in the image of God. They knew of the Redeemer of the world and deeply did President Hardy know that some day, the people of those islands of the sea would come to a knowledge of the restored gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. For over a decade he served as a member of the First Council of the Seventy, a position he dignified and to which he gave all honor. He had a fine idea of accuracy and a desire for the exact truth, which grudged no time and pains in tracing out even what might mean a small matter. He had a sound and calm judgment which subjected his own and all people's inferences to a searching review. With these fine characteristics, he threw the whole force of his nature into the work of the Seventy of the Church. The dignity of the work was in keeping with its importance. The missionary system is a means to an end; and every seventy, a missionary, should bring his soul to the desire to go forth and \"preach the gospel to all peoples of the earth.\" He wanted the seventies to become students and teachers, but ever given to the deep knowledge that each one by the grace of God has that eternal testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God to usher in the new age of the gospel of salvation. So he lived and died, knowing that the forces which are to make the world the world it ought to be are now within it."

Bennion the Church has lost one of its most valued and valiant servants. He leaves behind a vast multitude of friends. While we knew he had been laboring under the handicap of an uncertain heart for some time, none of us expected him to leave us when he did. Practically all of his mature years have been devoted to the missionary work of the Church, for it was soon after his marriage that he accepted a call to the Central States Mission where he spent the next twenty-eight years of his life, presiding over the mission for twenty-six of them. Upon that mission he stamped his personality, and to an even greater extent he leaves his mark upon the Church through the many men and women who worked under his direction in spreading the 'glad tidings of great joy\" to the world. He taught them faith in God and humility, honesty, devotion, integrity, industry, and the other virtues which characterize true Latter-day Saints. From the Central States Mission he came to the First Council of the Seventy which gave him another wide field of activity. Here he came into closer touch with the presiding officers of the Church, in its general offices, and throughout the wards and stakes, and widened the circle of his influence. While at Independence he had the Liahona and printing plant to manage which experience qualified him to direct The Deseret News when he moved to Salt Lake City. President Bennion's parents were sturdy pioneers and he gained from them a physical and intellectual endowment which qualified him for life, under the rigorous conditions of our beloved West. ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION (Died March 8, 1945) He was equally at home as a stockman and farmer, a business man or a preacher of the restored gospel. Almost seventy-one years was the measure of his mortal life, and they were filled with acts of kindness and helpfulness. Our prayer is that God will give strength and courage, confidence and solace to his good wife who through all of these experiences stood by him. Page 201"

Ma bey Former Governor of the State of Utah Prepared at the request of the Church Beautification Committee  ALL great movements of history have their leaders. The farther they recede from the present, the greater the halo that surrounds them, and the dimmer the figures that made their leadership possible. In that famous march of the ten thousand of ancient Greece, our mental eyes embrace but one personality: Xenophon; all the others are shadows. The children of Israel wandered forty years in the wilderness under the guidance of Moses; him we recall, the several hundred thousands of his followers are ghosts fast disappearing in the night of the centuries.

            "content": "remember. The Mormons trekked across the plains and founded this mountain empire, and at once when we recall the event, Brigham Young stalks across the stage.\nIt is not that we think less of the men and women who took part in these great movements. We know that not one of these geniuses could have become great without followers who were likewise great. The common man and woman of Mormondom were not a whit behind the moving spirits of every historic epoch. Side by side with Brigham Young were ten thousand other men far less known, but equally as resolute, equally as bold, equally in enterprise, equally as loyal to a mighty cause. Had accident or the purposes of the Almighty chosen them to the supreme command, they would not have been found wanting. Each one that came here and endured to the end was a giant in faith, in courage, in steadfastness. The victory in the fight against the forces of nature and those of evil is always achieved by the common soldier. In following the fortunes of these stalwarts, one feels that he is watching the stride of supermen and that the life of each is as interesting as that of his leader.\nNever before or since did men and women display such boundless energy. Within ten years of their arrival here the valleys of Utah had been taken up, villages or towns had been established as far east as Colorado, as far south as Arizona, as far north as the Salmon River in Idaho, and as far west as the Carson Sinks, to say nothing of the settlements in San Bernardino and the Mormon River district of California.\nWherever the colonists penetrated, there went law and order, thrift and frugality, and a decency in living seldom equalled and never surpassed. Roads were laid out, bridges built, towns surveyed, lands broken up and cultivated, homes, schools, and meetinghouses erected. In a primeval mountain fastnesses were conquered and the ring of the woodman's axe became familiar to the denizens of canyon and stream. LET US HONOR THEM 203 EVERY GREAT MAN IS BACKED UP AND SUSTAINED BY GIANTS IN FAITH IN COURAGE IN STEADFASTNESS STOCKRAISERS PROFESSIONAL MEN WOMEN STATESMAN BUSINESSMEN BUILDERS FARMERS ARTISANS A LEADER Water was diverted from a thousand channels and poured out upon the thirsty soil, thus making of a desert a fruitful field. The four corners of the globe were scoured to secure seeds that might thrive in this section, and soon the husbandman produced crops that were the envy of farmers in less favored places. MANY of the converts to the new faith were splendid artisans. Saddlers and farriers, brick and rock masons, carpenters and cabinetmakers, millers and lumbermen, wheelwrights and waggoners, blacksmiths and cobblers, all the trades known to civilization, were represented in practically every town by skilled workmen. Whatever was needed in the shape of home appliances and utensils, farm implements, or clothing for the body, could be and was produced. Sugar mills and tanneries, looms and spinning wheels, were soon in operation. Mass production with its thousand and one articles so common today-cereals, breakfast foods, bacon, ham, canned vegetables and fruits, and gadgets that make the housewife's labor a joy?had not yet made their appearance on the Western stage. In consequence, the local craftsman fabricated his wares with much pride therein, fully aware of their worth. Most pioneers had not had the blessing of an education, but they loved learning with passionate devotion. One needs but to scan the early issues of The Deseret News, note the advertisements and see how many of them have to do with educational subjects. Schools functioned in every village and hamlet, side by side with the plow and the scythe. For example, on September 20, 1848, Joseph Holbrook moved with his flocks and herds ten miles north of Salt Lake, and within a month had made a school-house of bullrushes and mud so that his children and those of Anson Call might receive tutelage. This is but one of hundreds of similar happenings, and by 1850 the University of Deseret was established. State, municipal, and county governments were formed and wholesome laws enacted. The crime, the drunkenness, and the general lawlessness that usually characterize newly founded communities were absent wherever these pioneers were in the ascendancy. When one realizes this and the self-sufficiency of the new colony, one sometimes wistfully wishes oneself back in its quiet seclusion, untroubled by the worries that harass the world today. This people was not wealthy in jewels and precious stones, in gold and silver, in magnificent mansions and palaces of pleasure, but its plain, homespun existence made for solidity, stability, and honesty, qualities which are sorely needed in this year of grace, 1945. Is it any wonder that we honor them?"

They should then be taught to budget their money carefully, teaching them that the first tenth belongs to the Lord, and is not theirs to spend otherwise. Thus, they will learn the habits of honesty, thrift, and independence. The payment of tithing can easily be made a habit if there is never an exception allowed, even though children may feel they need the money for something else. Sometimes children earn money and carefully save it for a special purpose, and are tempted to let the Lord wait until later for that which is his. Parents would do well to be firm in permitting no exceptions to the rule that the tithe comes first; it is not ours to spend. It should be designated for the one, sacred purpose. Thousands will testify to the greater joy and strength which comes from strict and unfaltering obedience to this law of the gospel.\nIn preparing a Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association class of young girls to make an excursion to the temple to be baptized for the dead, I was astounded to find how many of them had never paid tithing, nor felt they had ever owed any. Many of them had earned small allowances at home, but just had not been taught that they should be tithed. We only learn to do by doing, and it is most important that parents create the opportunity for the forming of this habit in very young children. Some parents make the excuse that it would be a burden for the bishop to keep a child's name on the tithing record for a very small sum. Any\nbishop worthy of the calling feels a real thrill when a child comes to pay his tithing, even if it be only a dime. A child's tithing receipts should be among his most prized possessions, tangible evidence of his worthy standing in the Church?not to be exhibited, but for his own satisfaction. The amount is not the important thing; the child's or the widow's small tenth is just as acceptable in the eyes of the Lord as the thousands paid by the rich man.\nThe Lord has spoken through his prophet Malachi: \"Prove ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\" Blessings of health, of harmony in the home, the feeling of peace and well-being in one's soul, of love and good will toward one's neighbors, cannot be bought with money, but only by keeping the commandments. These blessings may be ours if we can say as did Jacob, \"and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.\""

This is the second time only that the General Conference has not convened here. The other instance was in St. George in April 1877. Correspondence: Nutrioso, Arizona, Feb. 13, 1885, Editor Exponent ? Thinking perhaps a few words from far away might be interesting is why I write. We left St. George the last of June 1883, and after an agreeable visit to Panguitch Lake and various settlements we returned to St. George to the fall conference and soon after bade adieu to our much cherished home, and the Temple and its pleasant associations. We had a very prosperous journey of 500 miles through an indescribable wilderness of sterile barrenness, and came to this place in good health and spirits, although tired, worn and weary. We here found most of our family in peace, comfort and reasonably prosperous in the midst of the saints. This is a pleasant, fertile, but small, valley, truly in the tops of the mountains, with beautiful scenery of low hills and openings of timber for farms, with the necessary water, this being a rainy climate. We have here the best built and finest little town in Arizona; the dwellings of frame painted white, with good, substantial frame barns and outhouses; a cooperative store in healthy and prosperous condition. We have a good frame meeting house, also white, which is also our school house. Our meetings are well attended, also our day and Sunday schools, not forgetting the prosperous condition of our Primary and Relief Society. The Brown brothers have a steam saw mill in successful operation, to whose enterprise and energy much of the prosperity of this little town is to be credited. Yours respectfully, T. C. @ RRA Letter from a Gentile, Mrs. Wells: I take several papers, but none that I read with more interest than the Exponent. 1 am watching with great interest your people struggling for existence, surrounded by enemies as they are, and what the result will be I cannot yet tell; but my opinion is that riches and selfishness will be the greatest enemies your people will have to contend with. This was the great moral disease that Jesus Christ found in the world and prescribed for; and so long as your people follow His directions closely and attentively they will live and grow and prosper; but when riches, pride and selfishness grow up among you, then you will have only a form of godliness without its power, as the religious orders of this country, and the spirit of the world in all of them and the spirit of Christ not found in them.?John M. Russel. RELIEF SOCIETY REPORTS Fremont, Piute Co., Editor Exponent ? Thinking that a few words from this part of the vineyard would not be amiss we send a few words to let you know that we are alive to our duties and striving, to the best of our ability, to serve the Lord and teach the young in the ways of truth and righteousness. Our association is in good condition, and the members are always ready, when called upon, to respond to their duties. If you think this worth space in your columns please publish.

Anniversary programs held throughout the Church testified to the love of the women for their organization and to the appreciation of the members of the Church for its efforts and accomplishments. The milestone reached on March 17, 1945 reminds us that Relief Society women have been working, serving, and studying together for 103 years. Their organization which was founded by a prophet of God on a broad, liberal, and adequate foundation has enabled them to meet assignments, requirements, and needs as they have occurred during this long period of time. Their experiences in this great. Society, dedicated to service and education, have been manifold, varied, and stimulating. In their labors they have learned how to be helpful in overcoming the difficulties and hardships of daily life, how to be helpful in solving problems incident to migration and pioneering, and how to be helpful in the adjustments and readjustments confronting individuals, families, and society in this great century of changes and developments resulting from discoveries, inventions and new and different conditions. And because of these activities which have constantly required strength, foresight, and ingenuity, and bePage218 cause of the intelligent study put forth in regular class work, learning how best to live and improve and enrich life, great development has come to these earnest and able workers. Thus it is seen that the Relief Society with its two-fold program has brought unusual opportunity to the women of the Church who have partaken of its advantages?opportunity for human service and opportunity for spiritual, intellectual, and emotional development. Through human service there has been engendered in their hearts a love and sympathy for others, the spirit of the golden rule, and that respect for human personality which was taught and practiced by the Master himself. And through regular educational study and research the lives of all who participated have been enriched. Their motto has been \"The Glory of God Is Intelligence.\" To the women of the past we pay tribute. We are indebted to them for their vision, self-sacrificing efforts, and untiring labors. They have left us a rich heritage of faith and devotion to the Relief Society cause and to the restored gospel. Their testimonies of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and their lives of service to the Church have been an inspiration and strength to us. To our co-workers, we offer congratulations for their like devotion and fortitude and for their great accomplishments in these days of apprehension and anxiety; Our prayer is that the Lord will bless and sustain them. And to the new and vigorous young leaders and workers who are coming into the service we say, look backward as well as forward; strive to properly evaluate the past and use it as a foundation for the future; and look forward with faith and a long view.

            "content": "Come in for Dessert Edna K. Ward THE homemaker today who must be hostess, cook, and maid is discovering many short cuts. Elaborate entertaining, and many-course, complicated meals went out with whipped cream and two-inch-thick steaks. Entertaining at all might require justification with so many homemakers working in war industries, busy in Red Cross canteens and sewing centers, serving as nurses' aids, and Gray Ladies. Returning home worn from the work of thee day, it requires courage to undertake the entertainment of our friends, and yet it is in times of stress that the companionship of the friends we see so seldom gives a lift to their morale and also to our own. If we can find a way to extend this courtesy with simplicity, consistent with rationing restrictions, we may foster the place of the home in the lives of our children and our friends. The trend of modern life in America has seemed to be away from the home and home interests. A dinner downtown or at some club, lunches and snacks at the drugstore for children as well as adults, has made the home mean less in the lives of many than it did in pioneer days. Home influence has decreased in direct proportion. No one has time for elaborate meals these days, but any meal should be worthy of the time you do give it. Badly planned meals are neither fun to prepare nor to eat; the food that appears daily on your table has to be Page 220 prepared by someone?and that someone must like what she is doing or the result will be far from satisfactory. For cooking is a peculiar occupation; to succeed, it must combine the best of both work and hobby. Only when cooking is viewed and approached as an art, which it is, is the burdensome repetition of the task turned into a self-gratifying performance. If you give it your heart and mind it can be as satisfying as painting pictures. Colorful china, linen, flowers from your garden are your \"brushes and oils.\" With them you can create a background that makes even the simplest meal more glamorous. Foods in themselves have their own natural beauty. It's mixing them up?the reds, greens, yellows and whites? that gives your meals the most appetizing effect. Though the first impression of the dining table is only momentary, like a landscape just before sunset, the real fun is in creating it, and that will last until you create another. And there's more involved in it than just the \"looks.\" Digestion depends upon the psychological reaction to our senses. Food that is well cooked and nicely served creates a healthful response in the attitude of the mind toward food. Emotional disturbances, fear, anger, anxiety, unrest banish appetite and stop the flow of the digestive juices. Happy influences, harmony, and beauty stimulate and promote these vital functions. COME IN FOR DESSERT TABLE SET FOR DESSERT And so in these busy times let's make home meals and company meals as simple and nutritious and beautiful as possible. To simplify home entertaining even more, it is possible to substitute a single course ?invite your friends for dessert. This touch of hospitality may be the occasion for a pleasant evening at home. It is hoped the suggestions given in this article may call forth original ideas that will be practical in the individual home. In planning an evening dessert, the invitation can be extended on short notice. A call on the telephone in the morning with the explanation that you are serving only dessert, and arranging an hour convenient to both hostess and guest, makes the occasion informal. The hour may be seven-thirty or eight o'clock. The planning must include the table setting and the menu, and perhaps the entertainment to follow. A small table may be set for four in the living room or the dining-room table may be used for a larger group. This is an invitation to use our choice pieces of china and silver ?the lovely compotes that mother prized or the chocolate pot that father brought from England or Germany when he returned from his mission. The table cover may be doilies or a luncheon cloth. The table mirror makes an attractive foundation for the display of a low centerpiece of ivy, leaf, berry, fruit or blossoms, each in season. Candles always add soft light to any evening meal. The service should be your nicest dessert plates or crystal sherbets with dessert spoons and forks. If hot chocolate or postum is used, the hostess may serve it at the table in either tea cups or after-dinner cups. The dessert also may be served by the host or hostess at the table. If one does not have help, to have everything on the table eliminates the confusion of someone leaving to bring things from the kitchen. Salted nuts are easily prepared at home and can be included, and homemade candy will always be appreciated. A few suggestive menus and recipes are given at the end of this article. A FTER lingering in the candle-light with good food and interesting conversation, the party may move to the living room and its cheery fire, or to the summer terrace. A planned evening might include discussion of current events, of civic problems or neighborhood projects, a book review, a report on a current magazine. Too often magazines in the home are read by only one member and the contents are unread by the others. Much valuable and interesting material is appearing in the better magazines today. If one or more of those present would undertake the review of some article of interest, it would be a stimulus to his own development and of interest to all. For those who like music, an evening of singing around the piano can be delightful, as can also be an evening spent in listening to recorded symphonies. If a guest is known to have a hobby, he may like to demonstrate it or discuss it, and games always make an evening enjoyable. In these changing times should thought not be given to the preservation of the home and the reestablishment of its place in the lives of both children and adults? Practically all entertainment was provided by the members of the family in former times, with a resultant development of those taking part. Such growth is not promoted by sitting in a darkened movie under the emotional drive of scene and symbol in a world of unreality. Whatever one can do to add to the meaning of the home will be helpful in maintaining the kind of citizenship that has e made America strong. Every mother who gives thought and care and effort to the creation of an interesting and cultured home, adds a touch of sweetness and enrichment to the lives of all who spend an hour within its walls. Home is a woman's rightful throne. Suggestions For a spring evening use a bowl of violets with yellow doilies or tablecloth, and have a tiny violet corsage on each napkin (for the men, too). Serve: Meringued peaches*, custard sauce*, cookies, lemonade, or orange-cream-filled* sponge cake, hot postum. Green is spring's own choice. With green doilies use your best white china and white lilacs. Your table will look as crisp as a white starched pinafore. Serve: Vanilla ice cream with hot cherry sauce or crushed strawberries, warm cup cakes, french chocolate* or lemon meringue pie, beverage. *Meringued Peaches: Drain canned peaches or peel, stone, and cut in half fresh peaches. Place on cookie sheet or baking pan. Top with COME IN FOR DESSERT 223 meringue, leaving in peaks. Place in oven and bake 325? for 10-15 minutes. Do not cook too fast. Meringue: Add two tablespoons sugar to each egg white. Add 1/8 teaspoon baking powder. Beat egg white until stiff. Add the sugar and baking powder and beat until glossy. * Custard Sauce: 1 cup milk 3 egg yolks /4 cup sugar 1 tbsp. Flour Vanilla flavoring 1/2 cup cream. Beat egg yolks, add the sugar and flour. Gradually add the scalded milk, cook until thickened. (Use a double boiler to prevent scorching.) Cool. Add flavoring. Whip cream and fold into the custard. To obtain cream for whipping: Spoon top carefully from milk bottles (not the children's milk). From a 2-quart bottle you can get 12-16 teaspoons of cream that will whip. Save in refrigerator in a bottle until you have enough (3-4 days). * Orange-Cream Filling: 3/4 cup sugar 5 tbsp. Flour 1/2 teasp. Salt 1 tbsp. Orange rind 1/2 cup hot water 1 cup orange juice 4 egg yolks | tbsp. Lemon juice 2 tbsp. Butter Mix sugar, salt, flour, and orange rind. Add orange juice and hot water. Cook until thick, stirring constantly. (Use double boiler or turn heat low.) Add beaten egg yolks and butter and continue to cook 3-5 minutes. Add lemon juice, beating thoroughly, and cool. Split sponge cake and spread on thickly, and fill center hole. Frost with seven-minute icing or whipped cream. *French Chocolate: 3 squares unsweetened chocolate 1/2 cup water Hot milk 3/4 cup sugar Dash of salt cup cream Combine chocolate and water and cook for 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Add sugar and salt and cook 4-6 minutes longer. Cool. Whip cream and fold in. Place one rounding tablespoon in each cup, and pour over hot milk. Stir to blend. Serve at the table, putting chocolate mixture in a silver bowl and hot milk in that special pot or pitcher. The chocolate mixture may be kept in the refrigerator for several days."

            "content": "Perennials For All-Year Blossoming Hazel D. Moyle ?FLOWERS are among God's finest thoughts of beauty, taking form to gladden mortal gaze?bright gems of earth, in which, perchance, we see what Eden was?what Paradise may be!\" These are the sentiments of a famous philosopher. Do we not, then, need flowers round our homes now as never before to comfort our spirits and give us hope and courage during these dark and busy war times? To me the meanest flower that blows can give? Thoughts that do often lie too deep for words. So said the poet Wordsworth. Let us not deprive ourselves of these lovely symbols of truth and beauty: every home should be a citadel of tranquillity ?during these troubled times, a place where our faith can be restored and our dreams renewed. We need our flower gardens in which to reclaim our ideals? but just how are we to find time to grow flowers, with the daily schedule of everyone already so overcrowded? The answer may be found in the planting of perennial flowers, for these plants are more or less permanent additions to the garden, once they have become established. The perennials live over year after year, many of them giving increasing bloom and beauty as the years Page 224 pass. They become old friends, reappearing with punctual precision each at its appointed time. We have chosen six well-known and easy-to-grow perennials as being essential for every garden, for by planting these six indispensables any home flower lover can enjoy bloom from spring until fall frosts arrive, and almost every back yard can find room and time to cultivate such a simple planting. While there are many other beautiful and worthy flowers that can be grown without a great deal of skill or extra work, we believe the following should be in every garden, not only for their desirability and beauty, but because they thrive with ordinary care in almost any location. The peony comes first on the list, because it is the earliest to bloom and also because of its long life. Last year I saw a fine old peony plant that had flowered each spring for thirty-five years without replanting ?and it was a garden in itself with its great mass of nearly fifty large double blooms. Remember, when you set out roots of the peony next fall (for this plant should never be planted in spring), that in order to enjoy such a performance of flowers, perhaps for the rest of your lifetime, you should see that it is planted correctly. Choose a spot in full sun, well PERENNIALS FOR ALL-YEAR BLOSSOMING 225 away from trees and overhanging growth, and dig a hole at least two feet deep. In the lower half of this hole you must place good, rich nourishment for those future years of bloom, old barnyard manure should be used generously and well tramped down. Then a layer of ordinary, good garden loam should be thrown in, upon which to set the roots. The pink buds or eyes should be placed one inch below the surface of the soil?this is of the greatest importance for too deep planting is the cause of many failures in blooming?firm this soil well before planting, so the new roots do not settle too deeply, then fill up the hole and water well. Choosing from the bewildering wealth of lovely and desirable varieties offered in the catalogues, becomes a major problem for any flower lover, but if you will use the rating of each kind as given by the American Peony Society, printed plainly in front of the description in all reliable catalogues, this will assist you greatly in making your choice. Good points are rated up to ten which would make a perfect flower. There are actually some with the highest rating of 9:09 that are now very cheap in price. Any variety receiving a rating of 8 or more should be a good choice, those of lower rating usually having some fault or other. Remember that by choosing early, midseason, and also late-blooming varieties, you can enjoy a long season of bloom, and, if you have room, do include that grand old flower, the Decoration Day peony, officinalis. This is available in pink, red and white. It is a flower of satiny luster and it also blooms two weeks or more before other varieties. The second perennial on our list is the iris.... And who would do without this wonderful flower! Designed just for the busy gardener, this accepts our hot, dry climate with amiability, demanding little care. Ordinary unmanured soil suits it well, its one absolute requirement being an open, sunny situation. In order to bring out the full beauty of the lovely, silken iris flower, the plants should be well watered while buds are forming, and during the flowering. (You can prolong the blooms and make them much larger, too, by watering generously at this time.) But for the rest of the year they can stand neglect. If you have not grown any of the newer varieties of iris, then you have a treat in store. Every garden should find room for the exquisite, great, orchid-like bloom of the variety \"William Mohr,\" which can now be purchased for a mere trifling twenty-five cents. A still newer and lovelier variety in named \"Ormohr,\" costing a dollar or more. Iris experts have recently produced one named \"El-mohr,\" the same breath-taking size and beauty, but taller and of a deeper colored mulberry-purple. Being a rare, new type (producing a seven-inch flower), this demands a high price, however, in a few years, we can all enjoy it at a reasonable price. \"Purissima,\" a beauteous white variety, and \"Wabash,\" notable prizewinner with great blue-purple falls and white standards, also deserve every gardener's consideration ?but choose for yourself according \n226 to your own tastes and purse and space.\nThis can be transplanted at almost any season, even when in full bloom. So if you see some flower that you covet, this coming June, there is no reason why you should not take a start home with you.\nTHE third perennial on our list is the flaunting 'oriental' poppy. For sheer glamour and breath-taking beauty, one need look no farther than the new varieties of this fine old flower with their beautiful, silken flowers of such melting colors as coral, geranium-pink, flame, cerise and shell-pink. The finest of all is named 'Wonderkininde,' a great flower of lustrous watermelon pink, as large as a dinner plate.\nThis plant has one strict requirement: it should be planted during its dormant season, which is from August until late fall. Spring planting brings only failure, so be sure to order your plants when the poppies bloom during late May and June. Once established, there are few more faithful garden subjects, and their requirements are just ordinary garden care.\nJuly brings the splendid towers of blue of the modern delphiniums. Even one or two of these spike-like flowers can lift any garden out of the ordinary. While these proud blooms require a little more attention in staking and watering than others of our list, they are well worth the trouble. A lower and more spreading type named 'Delphinium Belladonna' can be grown with less care, and is longer lived than the tall new hybrids. Both are lovely.\nThe midsummer phlox is number five on our list?where could we find a finer flower for this time of year? The great, magnificent heads of bloom can now be had in a bewildering variety of vibrant and flaming colors. In cooler sections of Utah and Idaho this perennial fairly outdoes itself. Plant your phlox in most ground where they receive morning sun, but where they are shaded in the late afternoon. And if yours is a hot, dry garden, prepare the ground well with very old manure, then mulch the surface each spring with peat moss, lawn clippings, or more old manure. And if the flower heads are clipped off as soon as they have faded, others will form just below, and you can enjoy phlox for many weeks. Soak the plants deeply by allowing the hose to run without a nozzle during the blooming period.\nOur last flower is the chrysanthemum, for this is the queen of all fall flowers and one that brings an entire new season of beauty into your garden. Recent hybridizing has brought us many new types and varieties, many being early enough to bloom and valuable in colder sections where ordinary chrysanthemums seldom flower. The University of Minnesota has worked for years on an early and extra-hardy strain, and a splendid list of kinds and colors of these are now available as well as many other desirable new kinds and colors.\nThe cushion mums, growing into a low, bush-like plant, each so floriferous that one plant becomes a garden in itself, are also brilliant and lovely. One can now have chrysanthemums of almost any color except blue, and the taller Chrysanthemums will do in just PERENNIALS FOR ALL-YEAR BLOSSOMING 227 ordinary good garden loam, but will pay handsome dividends in deep color and profuse bloom if the plants are given a little extra feeding during the growing year. This is easily done by applying a one-inch mulch of old, well-rotted manure (cow manure is best) around each plant at two-or-three week intervals. First cultivate the surface, then apply the manure, and follow immediately with a thorough, deep soaking, preferably with the nozzle of the hose removed. Do not sprinkle as this sometimes brings mildew. This mulch helps to keep the soil moist at the same time it supplies mild feeding. With this, our sixth perennial, the year is brought to a close with a brilliant fanfare, a fitting farewell to summer. And the joyous part is that these same plants do not die, but when spring once more returns they arise from their winter's sleep in response to some mysterious call? The gentle heat and soft repeated rains, Make the green blood to dance within their veins, Then, at the call, emboldened out they come. And swell the gems, and burst the narrow room; Broader and broader yet their blooms display, Salute the welcome sun and entertain the day, \"Spring\"?Dryden"

            "content": "The Strength of the Pack Mary Petteison \n\"MOTHER, why are you up so early? It's only a quarter after six!\" Jane exclaimed as she came into the kitchen in her night gown.\nHer mother continued to sift flour into her mixing bowl till the sifter was empty. Setting it down she said firmly, \"Don't you realize what there is to do today? I have to be in court for Steven at half past nine.\"\nJane's mouth made ready to answer, but her mother, anticipating contradiction, went on to say, \"I know I don't have to be there till ten o'clock, but I want to be off the street before everyone in this community is on his way to work or to shop. Besides I'll have to prepare something for lunch that I can set down in a hurry, because you know I'm due at the Supply Depot at one o'clock.\"\n\"It makes me sick to think that Steve would be so silly as to get mixed up in a scrape with that tramp of a Rink Shader. When I asked him what he did it for he told me it was none of my business. I'd like to know if it isn't.\" Jane finished scornfully.\nJane's mother turned and faced her. \"He's my son and I don't want you to talk that way about Steven, but he was wrong to tell you it was none of your business. It is the whole family's business. What we'll have to do is to try to keep it from happening again. We must try to help him to live above his\nthings. I feel as if it were all my fault,\" she sighed.\n\"I don't see why,\" Jane protested. \"I do, and it's hard to take,\" her mother answered remorsefully.\nJane heaped two self-praise. \"See what I've done, I've kept myself and helped you with the living expense. I've had nice friends, too.\"\nMrs. Paige answered in a kindlier tone, \"Yes, you've done fine, but you must remember we've sort of worked together,' and for the first time Jane noticed that her mother had been crying.\n\"I'll come right back and help you, Mother,\" Jane said sympathetically, as she hurried off to dress.\n\"Jane,\" her mother called into the hall, \"be careful not to waken Lorna, but when you get dressed go upstairs and rouse Dwight and Ned. Breakfast is at seven this morning.\"\nSteven came into the kitchen with his shoes in his hand and sat down to put them on. His mother looked at him sadly. \"Here is a clean shirt, and you had better put on your best shoes, I want you to look neat and respectable. Hurry and get dressed because you know you have to report at school before you come to court.\"\nMrs. Paige walked hurriedly along the streets of Riverton. She carried no umbrella though rain seemed imminent. Above all, she hoped she could not meet not be overtaken by anyone she knew. She was too full of doubts and regrets to carry on conversation. She remembered how often in her sorrow her friends had persuaded her to get out among people. \"Children that are watched too much don't get along any better than those that are put on their own responsibility\" had been offered as sound advice.\nJust as she reached the street corner on the opposite side from the court house, she saw Judge Alden ascending the steps. She quickened her gait, wishing to speak with him before he settled down to office routine. She entered the main hall just as he was going into his office. \"Good morning, Mrs. Paige,\" he said cheerfully, and closed the door.\nFull of misgiving and disappointment, she went into the Juvenile Court and seated herself on the east side of the room, four seats back from the Judge's table.\nA crash of thunder echoed through the building and the rain began to fall copiously. She sat watching the ever-flooding window, lost in the problem which faced her. At length she murmured, \"There's no use of talking to the Judge about my trouble. I know the ins and outs of it myself.\" She remembered the day when Steven had come in confidently and asked, \"Mother, will you buy me a wheel, nearly all the boys have one?\"\n\"No! I can't afford to buy you a bicycle,\" she had replied curtly, \"now let that end it.\" He had not spoken more, and she recalled now that he had never mentioned it again. She felt he had neglected her children and her duty as a mother, and began twisting her blue fabric gloves into rope-like furiousas, as she tried to think what she could do to get control of her emotions and her affairs. She shook the\ngloves loose as a thought shaped itself in her mind. I'll try and get Steven away from Rink Shader. I'll sell my house and move to a better neighborhood. She visioned her house and yard in detail. How shabby it all was, no one would buy it. Then another thought came to her. It wouldn't do any good to sell, all the children in the town attended the same school. It was not the location of one's home nor the failings of neighbors that brought one sorrow, it was one's own shortcomings. She put her hand over her eyes, \"Father in heaven what shall I do?\" she prayed.\nJust then the son came from behind the clouds and shown full on the rain-drenched window, as when a child smiles through its tears. The light at once drew Steven about her to a realization of where she was. She straightened her shoulders against the back of the bench and noticed that everyone connected with the case was in his seat, except the delinquent boys. What if they had decided to ignore the appointment! She cringed at the thought, but then she saw them coming through a side door, all eyes turned upon them. The Judge nodded toward them and indicated the chairs they were to occupy. Rink led the way shamefaced and dejected. He didn't expect anyone to sympathize with him, he would tell the Judge the truth and that was all he could do. Steven followed. His head was held high as if he were determined to face his mistake like a man, though it could be seen by his pale face and set mouth that he had suffered. Tears gathered in his mother's eyes at the thought of his misdemeanor. As he sat down he cast a furtive glance around the room, and caught the sympathetic gaze of his mother which gave him assurance. He sat up straight, his right hand holding the left one firmly.\nMrs. Paige listened intently to the court proceedings, the first one she had ever attended.\nThe Judge said seriously and yet with a tone of kindness in his voice, \"Rinkler Shader how did are you?\"\n\"I'll be thirteen the ninth of May.\"\n\"What does your father do?\"\n\"He's a brakeman on the S.P.\"\n\"Does your mother work any place outside your home?\n\"My mother is dead, but Aunt Mattie keeps house.\"\n\"Rinkler, I want you to tell me just how you got the idea to steal the bicycle\"\n\"Oh, I've wanted a wheel for a long time, and Trent Cage told me he could buy anything he wanted?'ed I thought it he's so rich he'd never miss the wheel.\"\nThe Judge raised his brows. \"Remember, my boy, if you take anything that belongs to another whether he be rich or poor, that is stealing.\"\nTurning to Miss Anson the Judge asked, 'Do you have any trouble with this boy in school?\"\n\"No, I wouldn't call it trouble. Rinkler has his faults, I've never known him to lie or steal.\"\n\"Steven Paige, stand please,\" the Judge ordered.\nSteven rose and faced the Judge with a confident, co-operative attitude.\nAfter a few personal questions which the boy answered promptly, Judge Allen asked \"How long before Trent lost his bicycle did you\nknow that Rinkler was going to steal it?\"\n\"Oh, I didn't know he was going to steal it, but I knew he had wanted a wheel for a long time,\" Steven replied anxiously.\n\"When did you first know that he had stolen the wheel?\" the Judge persisted.\n\"When I went with him to get it out of its hiding place, I thought something was wrong,\" Steven answered quietly.\n\"What did he promise you if you wouldn't tell where he got it?\" the Judge suggested.\n\"I asked him where he got it, and he said, 'Never mind where I got it, we are going to have it for our own,' \" Steven followed fearlessly.\n\"Don't you know that to use that wheel has been obtained dishonestly is next to stealing?\" the Judge demanded almost fiercely.\n\"No, sir,\" Steven replied, amazed at the serious attitude of the Judge.\nThe Judge leaned back in his chair, \"I think you boys are very ignorant of the difference between right and wrong, and, I want you to report to the probation officer every Friday afternoon at four o'clock, until he tells you that you are dismissed. Will you do that?\" the Judge asked, addressing Steven.\n\"Yes, sir, we will be there every Friday afternoon at four o'clock,\" Steven affirmed, and Rink nodded his head in agreement.\n\"All right, boys, you are excused. Now, don't forget to come.\" Then addressing the court: \"If there is nothing further, the court is dismissed.\" As he gathered up his papers, he noticed that Mrs. Paige and her son had left and he turned to speak to me?\" he asked kindly. THE STRENGTH OF THE PACK 231 \"Not now, thank you. I think I had better go home at once, though I may come and see you soon,\" she smiled gratefully. Rising resolutely she nodded to Miss Shader and Miss Anson, who were in close conversation, and left the room. QUTSIDE the air was stimulating. The sun was still shining, but it was blowing a little, and dark clouds were driving across the sky toward the east. Mrs. Paige hurried along, searching her mind for a clue that would develop into a workable plan whereby she might go on with her work and still keep the children busy at something useful. So deep was the trend of her thoughts that she was home before she knew it, but she had made her decision. Filled with energy and purpose she set the table, taking more pains than she had done since John's death. Steven rushed in all out of breath. \"My, that's a scrumptious lunch. May I eat right now?\" \"Guess so, but where are the others? Didn't they get out when you did?\" she asked apprehensively. \"Yes, but I hurried. I have to get back and make up the work I missed this morning when I went to court,\" he replied seriously. At the mention of \"court\" Mrs. Paige's face took on a grave expression. \"Shucks, Mother, don't be worried. Just because I was with Rink doesn't mean that I was stealing,\" Steven declared stoutly. \"I'm glad it isn't any worse, but you know what the Judge said. You accepted the use of the bicycle when you felt it was not right for Rink to keep it,\" she replied, looking at him keenly. \"Yes, but the Judge doesn't understand. I didn't know that was like stealing,\" Steven defended. \"It's just this way, Steven, you can't have anything to do with wrongdoing without getting tainted. I tell you we've got to get hold of ourselves and understand each other. I want to help you all I can, but if you are not going to stand by me I'll have to give up,\" she said with finality. \"Aw, Bus says your parents have to take care of you. He said his dad tried to run that bluff on him, but it wouldn't work,\" Steven divulged with bravado. Mrs. Paige was astonished to hear Steven repeat such remarks. \"I don't care what Bus says. It's what you say that matters to me. What are you going to do?\" \"How can I help without any money?\" he asked discouragedly. \"Help! You have been helping all the time. How would I have managed if you hadn't taken Lorna down to Aunt Nell's every morning, and then come back in time to help Dwight and Ned off to school? If you'll do what I want you to do, we'll find a way to make money honestly, and we will be able to buy anything we need.\" = \"What will we do?\" Steven asked doubtfully. \"I'm working on a plan which I think will be just what we want. When I get it worked out we are going to have a family home-meeting and discuss it. It just concerns our own family, so keep it a secret till we all decide what to do,\" she explained cheerily. \"Oh, that will be swell,\" Steven beamed with enthusiasm. \"Golly, look at the time! I'll have to go.\" Jane came in just as Steven was leaving. He didn't look at her, but she noticed how pale he looked. She sat down at the table silently, and began to unfold her paper napkin. Mrs. Paige brought two plate lunches to the table. \"I waited to eat with you,\" she said as she moved up her chair. \"I've at last awakened to my duty. When I realize how I've left the boys to their own thoughts and ways, Fm ashamed! We don't know who their friends are. It breaks my heart to think how I've shushed them when. They wanted to come in to play on a stormy night. From now on I want them to come inside and bring their friends, so I can know them and help them all to know right from wrong.\" \"That will mean a lot of work and worry, goodness knows we have enough to do now,\" Jane reminded. \"No, we can make it a pleasure and not a hardship if we manage it rightly,\" her mother answered confidently, and continued to elaborate on the necessity of knowing with whom the boys played. Jane thought, I simply can't understand what's changed mother; but she did not speak. She looked at her watch as she rose from the chair, \"Oh, it's a quarter to one.\" \"I'll go now, too,\" her mother decided, \"I can leave the table just as it is. Steven knows what to do.\" The two women left the house together, but their minds were miles apart, the one lighthearted and carefree, the other carrying the responsibility of guiding a family into ways of righteousness. It had been Mrs. Paige's intention to sound Jane out as to what she thought could be done about conditions at home. \"Oh I don't know. Mother, what would be best to do, but I'm willing to help in whatever you decide,\" Jane promised. As the girl went to her work, her mother reminded her, \"We hold our first home-meeting tonight.\" Mrs. Paige walked on, she was amazed at the possibilities which kept coming to her mind. THAT very night, after supper, she told the children about her plan, and they were delighted with it and pledged to do all they could to make it a success. \"Do you remember the story of the wolves, how they worked together?\" their mother asked, her eyes glowing with enthusiasm. \"Yes,\" Dwight answered, \"all their leader needed to do was to give a loud howl and the wolves came racing through the forest, barking once in a while to let him know they were coming, and soon the whole pack would be there, ready to take orders.\" \"Yes, that's just what they did. They seemed to live up to this rule, that 'the wolf is the strength of the pack and the pack is the strength of the wolf. We are going to be like that, we'll work together no matter what comes,\" she finished firmly. They all agreed on their officers. Steven was made president, his mother, vice president, Dwight was appointed secretary-treasurer, and Jane became the chairman of the THE STRENGTH OF THE PACK 233 ways and means committee with Ned and Lorna for helpers. \"I think mother's plan for gardening is the best thing she could have thought out? Steven, as president, declared, after his mother had disclosed her plan. \"Let's decide on what we'll plant right now.\" Mrs. Paige suggested that beans which could be sold, should occupy the greater part of the garden plot and that they should also raise plenty of other vegetables for home use. She agreed to pay the treasurer market prices for whatever she used in the kitchen. At the conclusion of the meeting Mrs. Paige called Lorna and whispered to her. Lorna, smiling happily, went into the kitchen cabinet and brought out a dish of mixed candy and nuts, which she passed to each member, while her mother instructed the boys on how to clean up the yard, and then told them she had already engaged a man for the next day to spread the fertilizer and help do the digging. As Mrs. Paige neared her home the next night, she knew by the sounds coming from the back yard that the boys were at work. Rink is there, too, I can hear him talking, she thought. She went around to the back and stood looking on. He was the first to spy her. \"Don't you think we're doing a good job, Mrs. Paige?\" he laughed, the perspiration running down his face. \"You certainly are, but doesn't your aunt need you?\" she replied a little coldly. \"Oh, I've done my chores, and I thought I?d help Steve work on the yard, if you don't mind,\" he finished, fearing her disapproval. \"Of course I don't mind. I think it's nice of you to want to help,\" she praised, and went into the house. As she removed her suit to put on her house dress, she could still see how his expression had changed when she had praised him a little. I just can't be mean to him, she decided. He is so anxious to please, and he has some good traits that I like, he tells the truth and he isn't lazy. I wish I could help him. His Aunt Mattie is too easygoing and his father is the kind of a man who never seems to realize how much a child needs guidance, she reflected. Rf4NE afternoon in July when Mrs. Paige came home, Steven was busy in the garden. He saw her coming and called happily, \"Mother, come and see the garden. Did you ever see so many beans in all your life?\" \"I've never seen vines more heavily laden. We'll have to pick them soon, but we must be careful not to destroy the vines,\" she answered, remembering that there would be many pickings. The next evening Mrs. Paige returned to find that the beans had all been picked. \"Oh, Steven, why did you do it before you had customers to buy them?\" she reasoned. Steven looked crestfallen, \"I never thought of that.\" Mrs. Paige bit her lip, \"Well, the only thing we can do is to cover them up with wet cloths till morning.\" Early the next day, Dwight and Ned were sent out with samples of beans to try and find customers among the neighbors, but they had little success. 234 \"Steven, you'll have to go farther, to the homes where they buy all their vegetables. The boys can never sell all these around here/' \"Oh, I can't sell them, I don't want to go asking people to buy beans.\" Just then Rink came around the house. \"Jiminy, what a lot of beans! Did you get all them out of your patch, Steve?\" \"Yes, and now he hates to go and sell them,\" Mrs. Paige interposed. \"Come on, Steve, I'll go with you.\" Rink filled a small pail with beans and the two started off. They tried several places without selling any. Becoming discouraged they sat down by the roadside, wondering what to do. All at once Rink brightened, \"There comes Chinese John! I'll bet he'll buy 'em. He told Aunt Mattie that all his beans got flooded out,\" Rick explained as he ran out into the road holding up the beans. \"Hi, John you want to buy some beans? Only ten cents a pound.\" John drew on the reins. \"Bleans! Yi, Yi, me bly bleans. Low M'lany?\" \"Forty pounds\" Steven gladly spoke up. John turned his cart around and followed the boys home. Mrs. Paige was astonished when she saw Chinese John pass the window with two baskets over his shoulders, but she did not go out for she wanted Steven to manage the selling. Presently, Steven and Rink came in with four dollars and twenty cents, the price of forty-two pounds of beans, and Steven said with a business air, \"Mother, give this to the treasurer when he comes.\" EARLY one warm forenoon in August, Mrs. Paige sat thinking, as she worked, of her experience during the summer. Everything was beginning to turn out according to her plan. It was true there had been some drawbacks, but she was satisfied with the results so far. One thing, especially, pleased her. She had been a help to the boys in her entire neighborhood, for the victory garden idea had spread, and nearly every child was busily and happily working in a garden. She was just rejoicing over the success of her example when Steven came in all out of breath, \"Mother, Rink and Bus are going up East Canyon to fish and stay all night, let me go with them, please,\" he pleaded. \"Oh, I wouldn't go if I were you. We are all going up there to stay a few days next week. The boys might go then as your guests. Let me see, today is probation day isn't it? Remember you musn't miss it,\" she admonished. \"I don't want to go next week. I want to go now!\" he replied, and dashed out of the house. Steven was not home at lunch time, but he had never, up to now, openly disobeyed her, so she trusted that he had not gone, and she went to work at one o'clock as usual. When she returned, Lorna came running to meet her as she did every night, \"Mother, Steven's gone a-fishing with Rink and Bus,\" she confided. \"He has!\" Mrs. Paige exclaimed in surprise. She took hold of the child's hand with a deep sense of defeat. By evening there was still no THE STRENGTH OF THE PACK 235 word from Steven. His mother went about preparing the supper as if nothing unusual was on her mind, but she was troubled. Just as the family finished the dessert Steven came in with several fish threaded in the crotch of a willow bough. His mother exclaimed, \"Well, here you are at last! Put the fish in that pan in the sink and come and eat now.\" The children were delighted with the fish, but their mother made no comment. Later in the evening Mrs. Paige sat alone reading. Steven came and stood at the back of her chair, \"Mother, Fm awful sorry I went, but-\" \"Were you standing by the pack when you disobeyed me?\" she asked with emphasis. \"Let me tell you how it was,\" he pleaded humbly. \"Now, don't tell me what Rink and Bus did. The idea of you doing what they wanted you to do. You ought to lead them, but you will never be a leader till you learn to make your own decisions,\" she interrupted. \"It was this way,\" Steven continued, \"I wanted to go so bad I felt that nothing else mattered, not even disobedience or my pledge to the pack. After we got there, though, I wasn't happy, and I begged Rink to come back with me in time to go and see Mr. Wooten. We were a little late, but I told him why, and he said, \"You boys sure know how to keep a promise, and now I dismiss you from your obligation of reporting to me.\" \"Oh, I?m so glad you persuaded Rink to go with you to see the probation officer. That's good leadership, Steven,\" she said proudly, \"though-\" \"Mother, please forgive me, I?ll never disobey you again,\" he broke in, the tears flooding his eyes. \"All right, I will forgive you. Now let's forget it,\" she replied earnestly. He leaned over, kissing her, and she returned his kiss fervently. Mrs. Paige sniffed and wiped her eyes. \"You know it's your birthday Sunday, and I want you to invite Rink to dinner.\" \"Oh, Mother, you are too good to me. I don't deserve it,\" he said though his brown eyes laughed with delight. Sunday, Mrs. Paige rose early to get the children off to Sunday School and to make preparations for the birthday dinner. The first thing she did after they had all gone was to frost the cake thick with white icing and write \"Steven\" in the center with yellow. Fourteen small, yellow candles adorned the edge, all ready to be lighted at the proper time. When the children came in at noon the table was set with the best silver and linen, with the cake as a centerpiece. Once they were all seated at the table, Mrs. Paige thought it was one of the happiest moments of her life. Rink, looking like a Rhode Island red rooster with his auburn hair combed sleek, smiled from ear to ear. After the dinner was over, Dwight and Ned slipped out of the room, and soon the two boys came in rolling a bicycle. Steven gasped in surprise, he had not expected a present. A card attached to the handle bar read: \"To Steven?The wolf is the strength of the pack?and the pack is the strength of the wolf.\""

            "content": "And Once to Grandma Doris Palmer GRANDMA Stanton looked wistfully after the mail truck, fading fast disappearing down the dusty street. Grandma had walked the six blocks to the little post office in the heart of the small rural town of Lakeview, for the past five days, and had received no word of any kind from any of her five children. They were all married now, and had families of their own. This was the first year Grandma hadn't had birthday cards and gifts sent in plenty of time for her birthday. Now only one short day remained.\n\"I'm sure there will be something tomorrow, Grandma,\" Donald Harmon, postmaster and owner of the small grocery store adjoined, comforted her, \"I'll bet your birthday will be remembered all right.\"\n\"Oh, I am sure it will,\" Grandma tried to reassure herself, \"but I never bet in my life, Donald Harmon.\"\n\"Well, you would lose this bet,\" Donald called after Grandma's retreating figure. Everyone in Lakeview loved and understood Grandma Stanton. She always put on a brave front, and underneath had a sweet and sensitive nature.\nThere was no time to stop and talk with friends who called to her as she hurried home?not this morning. Granddad was getting the ground ready for the vegetable and flower garden. They were late in getting it planted anyway.\nGrandma viewed their large, comfortable home with mixed feelings as she approached. The house was of colonial design, set back from the road amongst a group of oak and fragrant locust trees. To the right was the family orchard. The trees were already covered with pink and white blossoms. On the left was the vegetable garden. Two cedar pines decorated the front gate, one on each side of the walk.\nThe Browns lived one block nearer town, and the Hudsons two blocks farther north. The Hudsons paddled the three Jersey cows Grandma insisted on keeping. She did love to take care of milk, and make her own yellow butter and creamy buttermilk.\nGrandma and Granddad had been among the first settlers in Lakeview, and had watched its growth with pride and interest; but they had sold their farm to the Hudsons when the two boys had chosen other professions, two of the girls had married business men and Mary had married a young doctor in the nearby college town. It was there she had attended school and won a teacher's certificate, only to get married the following season. Now the old house was empty of young voices.\nGranddad was leaning on the plough handles waiting for Grandma's approval of the ground. Maybe it was not deep enough, and Granddad was not taking any chances. His hat was pushed back from his ruddy face, disclosing the shock of gray curly hair that was so like a little boy's. His bright blue eyes were twinkling at Grandma as she came through the gate.\"No packages, Maw?\" he questioned, glancing at her empty hands. \"Not a blessed thing, Dad. Do you suppose something's the matter with any of them?\"\n\"Now, don't go to supposin', or you'll have 'em all sick,\" Granddad interrupted. \"Don't some of the teachers graduate next month?\"\nGrandma thought a minute. \"Why I believe Lanie graduates from high school and little Lennie from grammar.\"\n\"Well, em's mighty dang expensive to graduate 'em nowadays, Maw. Jane says they reckon on presents and a lot of fine new clothes.\"\nGrandma sighed. \"Yes, I know, Dad. It's not like when we went to school. We were only too glad to be able to go. Maybe that's why Ellen and I never bought 'em presents, but they could write a fine long letter. Mary was coming to visit next month, or as soon as school was out and John could get away.\" Grandma was trying to find excuses for her children and, as usual, she succeeded. So now she brushed the little uneasy feeling behind her, and proceeded to boss Granddad and the making of her garden.\n\"Dad, can we get the vegetables planted this afternoon? Dear, dear, there is so much to do. We will just have to,\" Grandma decided. \"I can plant my flowers in the morning.\"\nGranddad nodded his gray head and pushed his hat to a perilous position, squinting at the heavens. Off to the southwest were angry-looking clouds tumbling over each other as though driven by the thunder that could be heard ever louder as the men plowed.\n\"Thunder shower comin', Maw. Better get your little chicks in. It'll be here soon. It'll be the very thing for the garden. Get up, Dane,\" he clucked to the big gray horse, \"Let's get this finished.\"\nGrandma raised her pleasant, seamed face to the growing wind and sniffed it eagerly. You could already smell the rain. That sweet, earthy smell. It was on just such a night that many years ago, it seemed to Grandma, that Robert came running in, his round face dirty and excited. \"Mother! Jane said I could just taste the dirt after a rain. She told a lie didn't she, Mom?\" He had been disappointed when she had told him that Jane just thought she could, because the smell was so fresh and strong. Grandma smiled at the remembrance.\nLennie's mischievous face then came before her, as he hurried to the chicken yard. His curly, white head could be seen now and then of the day bobbing up and down amongst the chickens. He would delight in these little chicks, she thought, picking up the different colored little bits of fluff, and putting them in the box with their mother where they chirped contentedly. Somehow Lennie never did hurt them or hold them too tight after Robert did. She had always told him he should raise chickens.\nGrandma's thoughts often strayed back to the time when her family was at home. As she hurried about the neat, sunny kitchen preparing the simple dinner, she wondered if Mary still loved home-cured ham. She placed thick slices of it beside the pitcher of creamy milk. Robert used to drink milk until she couldn't see how he managed to eat anything else. It wasn't so long ago that Lennie, home from college, had put his arms around her, giving her a \"bear hug,\" as he called it. He had bragged that no one in the world could turn out such nifty-tasting bread out of common flour. If she could just have them all back together again to cook for and pamper, it would be heavenly. She brushed away an obstinate tear as she went to call Granddad.\nIt sprinkled a little as they were eating \"It's just teasing,\" Granddad said, \"we'll get a good one tonight. Be better for the garden anyway. It might have been too wet to plant this afternoon.\"\nThat evening after the garden was planted and the chores and supper over with, Granddad let the paper he was reading fall to the floor and looked at Grandma with twinkling eyes. Granddad's eyes were always twinkling lately, more than usual it seemed.\n\"Anna Brown was over this morning while you was uptown,\" Granddad remarked with an air of great importance. \"She wanted to know if you would save all your cream tonight and in the mornin'. She went on up to Hudson's to see if they would have some.\"\n\"My lands, what's she goin' to do with all that cream?\" Grandma's eyes were wide with wonder.\n\"Well, she said some of her school chums were comin' on a visit, and she wanted something nice and coolin'. So I reckon she is making ice cream. If'n, it sure would taste fine these warm days.\"\n\"Yes, it would, Dad. We might make some. If Ann didn't want more'n half, there would be plenty for Grandma's birthday tomorrow. Grandma was wondering who Anna's chums were that were coming. It was a shame the girls couldn't come now, too. Especially Mary. She would know them all. Her thoughts went back to their neglect of her birthday. It was the first time they had forgotten it since they had all left home.\nTHE Stantons were almost always up with the sun, but Grandma beat the sun this fresh spring morning. It had rained during the night and everything was washed clean, and was being brushed with gold as the sun sent its golden rays among the scented trees. The birds acted as though they would burst their throats with the silvery notes they spilled forth to gladden the world. Grandma's heart was light as she prepared breakfast, pausing now and then to breathe deeply of the clean, fragrant air. Granddad came in with the milk and admonished Grandma not to forget the cream Ann wanted. ?Too wet to plant your flowers this morning, Maw. I do not want to plant your flowers this morning, Maw. Reckon I could plant 'em this afternoon, if you won't be too blamed busy,\" Granddad offered.\n\"Well, I'll just keep the few dahlia bulbs I've got and you can plant the rest. I'll show you where I want them before I go for the mail. Maybe I'll stop a minute at Ann's on my way back.\"\n\"I wouldn't stop there if I was you, Maw. Ann will be busy, I reckon, with the party for her friends.\"\n\"Well my lands, that's why I'm stoppin', Maybe I can find out who it is comin',\" Grandma was surprised at Granddad's lack of interest in the coming friends. Ann had always been like one of their own daughters.\n\"Ain't you goin' to make a cake today, Maw? One of them fruit cakes the boys like so. You could make a cake for your birthday while I'm plantin' your garden for you.\" Granddad was one of the boys who liked the cake he suggested.\n\"It looks like I would have to, if I get one,\" Grandma said fretfully. \"Ann sent me one last birthday, but ain't five new with her friends today.\"\nGrandma had to wait a few minutes for the mail truck to arrive. There was no one else in the post-office but herself. Donald Harmon and herself. She fidgeted around looking at the labels on the canned goods, until Donald had begun to sort the mail.\n\"I guess no one else is so anxious there as me,\" Grandma remarked, a sensitive smile playing around her mouth.\n\"It's been kinda quiet all mornin' here,\" Donald answered, flipping the list he'd left over, hating to look into the eager eyes watching him so expectantly. \"I guess there ain't anything Grandma. There was no packages a'tall this morning, ain't there anything else you want?\" he questioned, trying not to notice the tears Grandma was dabbing at furtively.\n\"Yes, I want to get some currants and citrus. Oh yes, and some brown sugar,\" she replied, trying to steady her voice. Pshaw, she never was good at hiding her feelings.\n\"Sounds like a cake was in the makin', Gram-ma. If it's as good as the last cake you brought to Rilla's wedding social, I'll sure be good.\" \"Now, Donald, you are just try-in' to make me feel good,\" Grandma scolded, picking up her packages. \"Maybe I'll send you a piece of it,\" she called back from the door.\nGrandma was feeling pretty blue as she made her way back. She left old and out of everything.\nA sound of great activity met her as she paused at the little iron gate leading into Anna's. Maybe Ann would like the ice cream when she was so busy. Grandma hesitated, one hand on the latch. Curiosity got the better of her, however, so she marched up and knocked on the door. There was a sudden quiet as Ann came and opened the door. \"Why, hello Grandma,\" Ann said loudly. \"I never expected to see you over here. I thought you were planting flowers.\" \"It was too wet this morning and Dad's plantin' some this afternoon,\" Grandma explained shortly.\n\"Come on in, Grandma,\" Ann invited after a hasty glance over her shoulder.\n\"I was wonderin' if I couldn't come in,\" Grandma said, her quick eyes taking in the drops of colored frosting scattered on the dining table.\n\"Hello, Grandma,\" Helen Larsen cried, running up and kissing Grandma's withered cheek. \"I'm coming over tonight, if I get through helping Ann in time. It's your birthday today, isn't it?\" Ann broke in. \"Mary mentioned it in her last letter. Let's see, that's been two weeks ago,\" she said as though thinking. \"We should have had a party on Grandma, Helen,\" Ann said indignantly.\n\"At my age?\" Grandma scoffed. \"I?m gettin? too old for such doings.\" \"Wait till I get my hat, Grandma, and I'll go with you and get my cream.\" Ann ran into the bedroom as Grandma started collecting her bundles. \"You know, I never had a party in my life,\" Grandma confided as she placed the jug of cream in Ann's hands. \"Why, Grandma, honestly? We will certainly have to give you one sometime,\" Ann promised, a slight flush stealing over her face. \"Now Ann, I ain't askin' for a party, but I have always wanted one,\" she added wistfully, a faraway look in her e3'es. \"Well, I must hurry.\" Ann quickly dropped the money in Grandma's hand. \"Now don't forget, you have a party coming sometime in the future. Grandma,\" and Ann's face wore a happy smile. Granddad said he had to go uptown in the late afternoon and wanted to know if Grandma was going with him. \"Well, I was going to see Grandma Hudson but I'm kinda tired, so guess I'll just rest a bit,\" she replied. \"I reckon you better Maw, the Larsens are comin' over tonight and you don't want to feel tired.\" Granddad got home just in time to milk. It was growing dark when he finally came in for supper, making much over the fruit cake Grandma had placed in front of them. \"It's not my birthday. Maw,\" Granddad teased her. \"Oh hush, Dad.\" Grandma didn't want to be reminded of it. She couldn't help feeling the children had neglected her. Grandma and Granddad were quietly reading when a loud knocking and shuffling of feet brought Grandma to the door. The sight that met her startled eyes nearly made her faint. The whole front porch was crowded with people. In the front of the group were her own five children, loaded down with bundles. Packed around them was the whole town, it seemed to Grandma. The words \"Mother\" and \"Surprise\" were mingled together as Grandma was picked up and placed inside, to be instantly smothered with arms from all directions. Everyone began talking at once, trying to answer the puzzled questions Grandma couldn't keep from asking. \"You tell her, Anna,\" Mary called above the excited crowd. \"Well,\" Anna began, \"Mary and the rest of your family had the idea of bringing a surprise party on you, and asked Granddad to meet them on the 5:30 stage. That is all there is to it, except I was afraid you would catch on when you were at my place today. We were decorating the birthday cake when you walked up to the porch, and I had to make you wait at the door while Helen whisked it into the kitchen.\" \"But how could you children get away alone?\" Grandma wanted to know further. \"Well, we just decided it would be nice to be home together again, so we just left our present sweethearts for our former one!\" Lennie broke in, sitting with one arm around his happy mother. \"We can only stay a few days, except for Mary. She is staying and John is coming and bringing the youngsters in a few days, for a longer visit.\" 241 \"I think we should sing some songs to start the evening right and bring back old times,\" Robert suggested, getting up and motioning Ellen to the piano. \"Let's begin with 'When You and I Were Young, Maggie' and say 'Mary' instead of 'Maggie' when we come to it.\"\n\"Oh I don't believe I can stand much more,\" Grandma said in a shaky voice.\nAfter a few songs and games, Grandma looked up to find Granddad's twinkling eyes on her. \"Dad, you old cheater, did you know all about this and never told me?\"\n\"Sure, I did,\" Granddad was enjoying himself immensely, \"I even gave Ann the money to buy the cream with.\"\n\"Well, I never.\" Grandma sank back in her chair. \"And I never even suspected a thing.\"\nHappy tears blurred her eyes when the time came to cut the birthday cake. It wasn't the huge cake nor the many gifts that brought those tears, but the knowledge that her children had given her first party. 242 \""

            "content": "Ten Miles to Calico Martha Roheson Wiight THE autumn sun poured in through the open windows of the pioneer Mormon meetinghouse. As Mathilda Dawson sat down, it touched with gold the tawny braids wound round her restless, young head. It even brightened somewhat the drab hair of the girl's work-worn mother beside her on the split-log bench. But no sunlight, Tilda thought, could lend any luster to their dull-brown, homespun dresses. This was the Sunday-afternoon sacrament meeting, so her father sat with the Seventies, just behind the Elders at the front of the room. Tilda glanced around. Frank Robinson was in his usual place on the opposite side of the meetinghouse. Every Sunday she felt the same tingle, seeing him there among the Elders. This time, though, his twinkling gray eyes were not waiting for her to look his way. Tilda followed his gaze across the aisle to the women's side, a little in front of her seat. What she saw tightened her throat. The strange girl must be from Salt Lake City. She was gay and dainty in pink, white-sprigged calico. She had a clear white skin, and cheeks that glowed like the pink of her dress. Her hair was dark and shining beneath the perky yellow straw hat with pink ribbons on it. Her hands were white and graceful. They would be soft to touch. Tilda scowled down at her own hands. They were tanned almost black, rough and calloused, with Page 242 cracked nails and knuckles. Quickly she hid them in the folds of her skirt. Any girl could look pretty if she had the clothes, and never had done a lick of work in her life. What good would that one be in the country? Wouldn't her hands look like something when she got through scraping black pots and washing dishes in hard water and lye soap! Imagine those French kid shoes after a day's farm work, plowing, planting, hoeing, chopping wood. Wouldn't be worth sic'em! The congregation stood for the opening song. Now Tilda saw the nice fit of the city girl's dress?snug at the waist and with a billowy skirt, three tucks featherstitched in with white floss. \"Come, Come Ye Saints!\" Tilda sang lustily to hide the ache in her heart. That girl was like a princess. Frank couldn't help looking at a princess. Just the same, it hurt. After the song they sat down. Tilda wanted to crawl off somewhere. She clenched her fists during prayer. Automatically, she put the small piece of fine white sacrament bread in her mouth and swallowed. She sipped the water, passing the large goblet on to her mother. She scarcelv heard First Counselor Williams bearing testimony and telling how glorious it was to be out here in Zion where the Latter-day Saints might worship as they pleased. By the time of the closing song, Tilda had made up her mind to get some calico herself, for a dress as TEN MILES TO CALICO 243 pretty as that pink one. Prettier! As they walked out of meeting, she hurried ahead of her mother to avoid Frank. She wasn't going to have him look from her to the princess, comparing them. But he called, \"Tilda! Tilda!\" She turned, then seemed to freeze. He was talking to that girl. Tilda had to stand and wait until they caught up. 'Tilda, I want you to meet Clarissa Wilkins, from Salt Lake City. She's visiting our ward today.\" Smiling, Clarissa held out her hand, \"How do you do, Tilda.\" There was nothing to do but take the white hand. It was as soft as Tilda had thought it would be. Clarissa gave her rough palm a little squeeze before she let it go. \"Pleased to meet you,\" said Tilda. Clarissa acted friendly. \"I've never been to Ogden before, or out here to Lynne Ward, either. It's beautiful.\" Tilda always had loved her mountains and this sky, but she only said, very shortly, \"I guess so.\" What if Frank Robinson was squirming with embarrassment? Well, he didn't need to bring her and this girl together. \"Nice day to make the trip up, Sister Wilkins,\" he offered. \"Yes,\" she responded brightly. \"Oh, there's my father! I have to go. Pleased to have met you. Sister Tilda. Goodbye.\" The princess floated away, a slim tree in full, pink blossom. Tilda watched Clarissa approach a surrey and fine team of horses. Some of the families in Salt Lake were rich. Clarissa stepped up gracefully into her carriage. Unshed tears stung the country girl's eyes. Frank flushed as his glance met hers. He probably was thinking how funny she looked. He might never have noticed that her dress was ugly if Clarissa's pretty one hadn't come along. The city girl had her hair fixed with long, slender curls pinned up in the back. Tilda's wasn't fixed at all?just wound in braids around her head. Tilda wanted to say out loud, \"I'm going to get me store cloth for a dress. It won't be pink, either. I don't like pink. It'll be a lot prettier than Clarissa's.\" Frank wouldn't understand, though. Showing him would be better. \"Got to go,\" Tilda said suddenShe joined her parents outside the meetinghouse door. Walking home with them, she tried to think of some way to get the calico. Home! This one-room dugout! Three years ago Tilda had helped her father spade the square hole into the ground, and securely pound logs on all sides. Across these they had placed roof poles, covered them with vdllows and sod. There was only one door and one vdndow. The floor was of earth, with loose boards laid over it. Tilda followed her parents inside. Mrs. Dawson scraped the ashes on the stone hearth, blew gently on the embers, and spread some chips over the bright glow to get the fire going. This was to take off the chill. A pair of three-legged kettles squatted beside the hearth. The room was furnished with three wooden stools and a hewn table, a corner cupboard, and a bed of poles with a cornhusk mattress. Tilda slept on the lid of the wooden chest opposite the bed. Her mattress was an old comforter doubled; her cover, a buffalo robe. As usual on Sunday, she helped her mother prepare supper. She turned the cold cornmeal mush out of the bowl onto a plate to slice. While she was getting the knife, Tilda noticed that the pen-and-ink sketch of her mother's \"caster\" was dusty. The life-like drawing, pasted on a thin board, stood propped against the earthenware jar on the ledge of stone above the fireplace. When the Dawsons came West, the actual silver caster had been left behind. Long after her parents slept, Tilda lay awake. Yard goods cost a lot. How could she get something to trade at Horrock's store in Og-den for the calico she coveted? Finally the idea came to her. The Burnetts had cut and stacked their wheat. There were always scattered, loose wheat stalks left among the stubble. Tomorrow she'd ask the neighbors if she might glean their field. AT daybreak, Tilda slipped out. Brother Burnett, just up, granted her request at once. \"Why, sure, Tildy. You go right ahead. That's pretty hard work, 'specially after you do all your chores, but you're welcome.\" Tilda hurried home. She gave a little skip through the door. Her parents were eating their hot mush breakfast. ?Ive been over to Brother Burnett's,\" she reported breathlessly. \"He'll let me glean his wheat field. \"I'll do it after my regular chores. Pa. You won't notice the difference.\" He had a spoonful of mush on the way to his mouth. He ate it before he spoke. \"What's all this about?\" \"Some calico. For a dress. Did you see the new girl at meeting? I want some calico like her dress. Only not pink. I'll work 'till Ihave a whole sack of wheat ready to take to town.\" Her father shook his head. \"You'd trade weeks of gleaning, flailing, and winnowing to Hor-rock's, just for yard goods?\" Tilda nodded eagerly. \"You females! What do you want another dress for?\" She gulped in astonishment. \"Why ? a bright, pretty color. Please let me get the wheat, Pa. Please!\" Tilda stood in front of him, her hands clenched so that the knuckles showed white. Her father said, \"You can glean the wheat. But this new dress business?it just ain't seemly.\" Her mother spoke. \"The dresses I make you ain't so bad. Took me nigh a month to spin and weave that cloth for your Sunday dress. And dyed floursack dresses ain't so bad for working.\" \"Oh, everything we've got is so ugly. Ma! Blacks and browns! We look like mudhens. I've got to get calico somehow!\" Her father rose, put on his hat. \"Don't expect any help.\" \"We need variety in eating,\" her mother wished. \"It's mush, mush all the time. If you got a bushel of wheat, we could use some butter. Maybe a little white flour. Or salt pork.\" Tilda choked out, \"I got to have want him to see her close until she something pretty. I got tor was wearing calico. She waved back Her mother said nothing more, brusquely and went on flailing. Her father scuffed through the The following Sunday she told door. Her mother that she was too fagged When the dishes were done and out to go to Sunday School or the room was tidied, Mrs. Dawson afternoon meeting. Mrs. Dawson went over to the fireplace shelf.

Her legs were corner squatted the great sack, near-cut and bruised by the stubble. Her ly full. Tomorrow would be the arms ached. Her back felt as if it last of the gleaning, and she'd have had a rusty hinge at the base of her a big pile of wheat stalks to flail spine. Yet she kept on doggedly, and winnow. Then only five miles gathering wheat stalks one by one. To Ogden. Only five miles to calTilda carried her gleanings home ico! The words repeated them-each day. She had stretched a tar selves over and over in Tilda's head, paulin over the levelest ground near Five miles to calico! Five miles to the dugout. On this, every evening calico! It was like a song, she threshed out the grains with a Despite her ruse to avoid meet-flail. Then she winnowed the ing Frank again before she'd be wheat and put it into a big, old sack dressed up, he saw her in her work-she had found. The sack would hold ing clothes on Monday. It could considerably more than a bushel. Not have been worse. Tilda was The sparrows bothered Tilda, gleaning in Brother Burnett's field. Wheat was too precious to have With her back to the road, she bent them gobbling it. She scared the far over to pick up several stalks, birds away with well-aimed pebbles The sun beat on her uncovered from her slingshot that she used to hair, which matched the color of hunt rabbits. Slowly her hoard of the ripe wheat. Perspiration streaked grain grew until the big sack her dusty forehead and ran into her bulged. Blue eyes. It even trickled down In the middle of the second her slender, bare, brown legs and week, when Tilda was threshing into her high-laced shoes. Her full just before supper, Frank Robinson skirt and petticoats were fastened and his grandfather, Bishop Robin up around her thighs, son, rode by. Frank reined up his Frank Robinson wasn't in her horse as if he meant to stop, and mind. Her thoughts were only of waved. Tilda had on her brown, her beautiful wheat, and calico. A flour-sack working dress. She didn't voice came from the road. ?A Howdy, Tilda.\" She jerked upright, clutching at her half-filled apron, and wrenched around. Her skirts swirled above her knees. Her heart first jumped into her throat, then dropped into her shoes. Frank sat there on the slate-colored mare, his long legs dangling. He brushed a lock of black hair from his eyes to see her better, and tried to keep a smile from coming on his mouth. No wonder! She looked her very worst. Breathing quickly, Tilda fumbled to button her waist, which was too far open at the neck. \"I?I didn't aim to scare you.\" Frank's smile came out. Tilda blushed furiously. Her eyes flashed. \"You didn't scare me!\" The words were curt and sharp. \"But you thought you were smart to sneak up on me like an Indian.\" She'd seen him look at her legs when she whirled. And what a sight she must have been stooping 'way over with her back to him! \"Honest, I didn't sneak up.\" His tone begged her not to get any madder at him. \"I was just doing an errand for grandpa and thought I'd pass the time o'day.\" \"Well, you passed it.\" Tilda turned away, being careful not to have her skirts flare out, and resumed gleaning. Now she half knelt as she picked up each wheat stalk. Frank sat still on his horse as if he didn't understand. Humph! After a minute or two he went loping down the road. Tilda crumpled on the ground, her head on her knees. She'd got her legs cut raw, her back nearly broken, her hands looking awful, to get a calico dress so that Frank would think she was as pretty as Clarissa. And how he had just seen her! He had laughed! What difference would a new dress make now? She wiped her hot, teary face with her apron. It was no use. Her conscience would nag her anyway if she had the calico. She'd be thinking of her mother needing a variety of food instead of mush. Tilda stood up listlessly. She would finish gleaning, and thresh and winnow the last of the wheat. Pa could take the sackful to town to trade for something to eat that would be a change. Out here all people did was work to get enough to eat. Tilda saw her mother trudging across the field toward her. She hadn't realized before that ma looked like an old, old woman. She plodded over the stubble as if walking in her sleep. It was from so much hard work. Ma never complained, but neither did she ever seem to take much notice of anything nowadays. Even of that picture of her precious caster set. \"Got the soap a-cooling,\" Mrs. Dawson called. There was no expression in her voice. Automatically she began picking up wheat stalks and stowing them in her apron. \"Thought I'd help you.\" Tenderness stirred Tilda. \"You got no call to do this. Ma. Go back to the dugout and rest yourself a little.\" \"I'm tired of being in there. Nothing else to do but this, for awhile. You? you'll get your wheat to town sooner.\" The lump in Tilda's throat choked her. Ma meant she should TEN MILES TO CALICO 247 get the calico. Ma was on her side. Tilda swallowed hard. Then, with the shock as of cold water thrown in her face, it struck the girl that her mother looked like a squaw. Her skin was lined and weatherbeaten, her dark hair lifeless. Her arms were thin and sinewy. Her hands resembled leathery claws. That stoop in ma's back came from bending, lifting, washing, laboring all the time. The one variety in her life was going to meeting on Sunday, seeing other tired, worn women like herself trying to keep awake during the sermon. Ma had grown old at thirty-five. Tilda thought, Fm past sixteen. How much longer will I stay young looking? She was awful tired right now. She might wear out even quicker than her mother. Oh, she musn't let herself get like ma! Whether or not Frank liked her in the calico didn't matter so much. She had to get it so she wouldn't wither up as her mother had done. Desperately, Tilda resumed her gleaning. That night her father asked if her task wouldn't soon be finished. He hadn't mentioned her work since she started. Why had he asked that? Rather worriedly she answered, \"Yes.\" 'I?ll get you a piece of twine to tie the sack. You maybe'll have over a bushel. Still set on the dress goods?\" More worried, she replied, \"Yes, sir, and thanks for the twine.\" Her father said nothing more, but the room seemed brighter to Tilda. Perhaps pa had joined her side. No doubt his interest was because she had worked hard. He always admired a hard worker. Tuesday afternoon Tilda worked at her threshing with a light heart. Thump! Thump! Went the flail. This was the very last batch of wheat stalks?she wouldn't mind how her back hurt. Her mother came from the dugout with a bucket of water. Tilda let the flail drop. She sat down against a stump to ease her backache. \"Seems like you'll 'most kill yourself just for a dress,\" her mother said, setting the bucket beside her. Tilda wiped her forehead with her forearm. She reached for the bucket. \"Thanks, Ma.\" She drank long and washed her hot, red face with the remaining water. She smiled up at her mother. \"It's sure nice wheat.\" \"Come winter you'll wish you'd got something heavier than calico.\" But Tilda sensed that her mother didn't really mean it. The sparrows were gathering near the tarpaulin. Tilda took her flipper and a stone from the top of the stump. She placed the pebble in the leather piece and pulled the elastics back until the two rubbers fastened to the sides of the fork were taut. Without aiming, she shot the missile toward the birds. They whirred away and Tilda replaced the flipper on the stump. \"Makes no difference if there is a bounty on the pesky sparrows,\" she said. \"I can't seem to want to kill 'em.\" Painfully she got to her feet. Her mother picked up the bucket and remarked, \"You don't have to get done tonight.\" \"Yes I do. I'm going to take my wheat to town tomorrow.\" \"To trade just for calico?when you could get?\" \n\nHer mother checked the wish, shadows shd over the surrounding Tilda flushed and glanced down at mountains. The last operation, her dull-brown, sage-dyed, flour sifting, required little time. Finally sack dress. The waist was opened she shoveled the sieved grain into at the neck to where the gentle the fat sack. Before tying the swelling of her firm young breasts mouth with the heavy twine her began. She drew a sobbing breath, father had provided, she ran her lifted the flail, and thumped the fingers down into the wheat caress-wheat stalks at her feet emphatical ingly.

Strong, lingering, A Prophet's inspiration and command Still guide us, with a love that never dies. Throughout the years a valiant, growing band Of mothers, loyal, humble, kind and true. Has sought and helped the needy, lit anew The flame of hope in many a careworn heart, Soothed many a fevered brow with gentle hand, And strong and steadfast, gladly borne its part In trouble, and when famine swept the land. Dear Father, by whose blessings all these years Thy daughters have grown numerous and strong. Facing the coming years with quiet eyes, Humbly we pray for wisdom to do right. And courage that strides onward though through tears. And deep humility and faith in thee.

As valiant, righteous, generous, and true As those first mothers, then our hearts' desire Thou wilt have granted, for we ask of thee But to be worthy of the name they bore. And of thy blessings on us, as of yore. Marianne Clark Sharp First Counselor in General Presidency, April 1945 President Amy Brown Lyman MARIANNE C. SHARP IT was while attending a Relief Society convention in New York City more than a decade ago, that I first learned of the excellent service being rendered the organization by Marianne Clark Sharp, the newly appointed first counselor in the general presidency of the Relief Society, who then resided there. She was pointed out as one of the ablest and most faithful workers in that locality and, best of all, one who was willing and happy to work wherever she was most needed. It mattered not to her whether it was as class leader, visiting teacher, officer, or lay member, her interest and enthusiasm in the work she had to do was always of the highest quality. Page 262 She served while in New York as literature and theology class leader, president of Queen's Branch Society, stake board member, and finally as stake counselor to Mrs. Lorena Fletcher. Mrs. Howard R. Driggs, also of New York, remarked at that time that Marianne would make a very excellent General Board member, and she expressed the hope that some day she would see her working in this capacity. It was only natural, after her return to Utah, that Sister Sharp should continue her work in the Relief Society cause. Her devotion and efficiency were soon recognized in both ward and stake where her work as a class leader became so outstanding that no one who knew her or her accomplishments was surprised at the call that came to her, in January 1940, to serve as a member of the General Board. And now at this time, her appointment, on April 6, 1945, as first counselor in the general presidency of the organization is heartily approved by Relief Society women generally, and especially by her fellow Board members who know her best and appreciate her most. Blessed with a noble heritage, a rich background, rare native endowments, broad education and training, and with unwavering faith in the gospel of the Master, Sister Sharp is especially well fitted for this place of honor and trust. She is also blessed with the support of a devoted and understanding husband, a Christian gentleman of the highest order, and a faithful Latterday Saint. Ivor Sharp to whom she was married in 1927 is the present manager of KSL. He came to this position from the Long Lines Department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in New York City. He is known in the business world as a man of fine character, outstanding ability and distinction, and is loved, honored, and respected by his associates in business as well as by his fellow workers in the Church. There are three lovely and interesting children in the Sharp home Luceine (Sally) Louise, and Annetta. To these children the parents are devoted.\nSister Sharp is the daughter of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., first counselor in the First Presidency of the Church, and the late Luceine Savage Clark. Theirs was a home where the standards of the Church were always strictly observed, and where the children were taught faith in God and in the latter-day work, that the greatest joy and satisfaction came to those who adhere to the religious life. Sister Luceine Savage Clark also loved and was devoted to Relief Society and its ideals, and worked in the organization all of her mature life. Her heart is no doubt made glad with joy and pride to have this greatly deserved honor come to her sweet and lovely daughter Marianne.\nDURING her five years service on the General Board, Sister Sharp has visited conferences and conventions and she has served on a number of important committees. Her major task, however, has been in the editorial field. With her discriminating judgment, quickness of perception, clarity of mind, and her capacity for work, and with the diligence and dispatch with which she works, she has given invaluable service as an editor. She assisted our new General President Belle S. Spafford in compiling, preparing, and editing A Centenary of Relief Society, published by the General Board during our centennial year, 1942. For a period she was assistant to Sister Spafford, the editor of Theand, in 1943, was named associate editor in which capacity she has served since that time. The many positions which Marianne has held have all come to her unsought. She has accepted these calls because she is obedient and because of her sense of service and her ardent desire to do something helpful for her Church and for her community.\nSister Sharp received her education in the grade and high schools of Washington, D. C. and at the University of Utah. From the latter institution she was graduated, in 1934, with high honors. She was awarded a teaching fellowship in Latin during her senior year and she continued teaching that subject at the University after her graduation.\nSister Sharp has rare gifts of spirit, mind and heart, with a deep humility. She is frank and honest, tender and sympathetic. She is generous and appreciative of the work and ability of others. While she has clear-cut, positive views, she is always open minded and teachable, always ready to listen to the views of others. But with her right and principle must come first. Above all she is loyal to those in her position of authority over her and gives them full support. She has great reverence for and is always obedient to the Priesthood. With these fine characteristics and qualifications her future is sure to be one of achievement. PARALLEL Alice Money Bailey I Strong and lithe they were, and full of grace  The legend sons of Helaman  for such, In tenderness, he called them, loved them much, Though they were soldiers his the right of mace Above them. Striplings all, they were  each face Unbearded; sweet of mouth as yet no touch Of war was theirs, no guilty shame, no clutch Of fear: The pure in heart! The swift of pace! And when he asked: \"Would ye go out to fight?\" They answered: \"Yea! To free our fathers' land\"  Rehearsed their mothers' teachings how the right Prevailed. In soberness they took the brand. Nor wavered in belief the God of might Would hold their precious lives within his hand. II Troubled in his soul and torn with doubt Was Helaman for on the plain below The battle raged. On Nephite friends, the foe Had turned the Lamanites and runner, scout Brought only news of tragedy and rout. For Antipus was slain, and blow on blow Was dealt his reeling columns. Tardy, slow. The leader sent his sons to draw them out. They fought as gods that day. Each flashing sword Was steeled by righteousness, the searing strain Of conflict ribbed by faith. At last, the horde, Abject, surrendered. Helaman, in pain Of fear, set forth to count. Proud words record Not one of his two thousand lads was slain! III The centuries roll out on a disk of time That turns upon itself\" for still men lust For power and riches, fame and toss the crust Of beggary to brother men each age a mime Of ages gone before. The parts, sublime And wretched all are there the foul, the just, The valiant. Nations leap to glory, rust. Decay, and crumble. Man alone is prime. Still mothers teach their youth simplicity. Obedience, faith and love 'and how to shun The coils of earth how touch infinity. Still are some who pray when day is done, Who know the source of power Divinity  And still in battle Sons of Helaman. Gertrude Ryberg Garff Second Counselor in General Presidency, April 1945 Edith Smith Elliott THE wise selection of Gertrude Ryberg Garff as second counselor to President Belle Smith Spafford of the Latter-day Saint Relief Society will be a blessing to the women of the Church. Her training and background fit her admirably for her new position. Above all else, she has a firm testimony of the gospel of Jesus Ghrist, and although young in years, she is old in experience. Sister Garff was born in Hyrum, Utah, to Charlotte Critchlow and Eric William Ryberg. Both the Critchlows and the Rybergs contribute a rich heritage to Gertrude. Her mother's forbears rank high in early educational fields and were participants in the American Revolution. Sister Ryberg has been a leader, active in Relief Society. Gertrude's father's parents were converts to the Church from Sweden. They settled in Logan, Utah, and played a forceful part in the development of that community. Brother Ryberg has been a successful contractor and is an outstanding executive in the business world. Sister Garff was five years old when the family moved to Salt Lake City in Wasatch Ward. She is fortunate to have had parents who trained her in the paths of knowledge and righteousness. She has always had great faith in her Heavenly Father, which has been a great source of comfort to her. She has been a firm believer in the fact that GERTRUDE R. GARFF *'faith without works is dead,\" so she has willingly done her part.   She completed her early studies in the Salt Lake City schools. Desiring further knowledge and training, she entered the University of Utah. At the end of her second year she received and honored a call to fill a mission for her Church. She was assigned to the Eastern States Mission under the presidency of Brother James H. Moyle. Here she labored as a field missionary in Jamestown, New York, and in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Her special assignment was radio work. Her mission strengthened her testimony in the divinity of Christ and gave her a religious schooling that has helped pattern her life.\nHer mission furthered her desire for learning. She knew that the \"glory of God is intelligence,\" so when she returned home she once more entered the University and graduated in 1935 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Her major was in textiles, with a minor in foods and child welfare.\nIN October 1935, she married Mark Brimhall Garff, son of Tryphena Brimhall (sister of President George Brimhall) and George P. Garff. She had met her future husband (who had been home two years from a Danish mission) at a Granite Stake conference where they had both been called upon to discuss their missionary experiences.\nIn September 1937, Brother and Sister Garff were again called to the Lord's service this time to preside over the Danish Mission with headquarters in Copenhagen. Their son Mark was only two and one-half months old so this made the planning for so long a journey a major problem. However, with faith in God they lost no time settling to the task before them. Both were very young to be given so important an assignment but, in spite of this, they made an enviable record. Sister Garff learned the language so that she could assume her full responsibilities as head of the women's auxiliaries, with a special and personal interest in Relief Society. She won the love and trust of the Danish saints. Her warmth and understanding made her role as \"mission mother\" a source of strength to the\nin the welfare of young people was ever apparent not has it even ceased since she returned to Zion.\nBesides discharging her many missionary duties admirably, Gertrude found time to study the social, historical, economic, and cultural aspects of the Danes. She learned to love and appreciate these Norsemen. A lover of art, crafts, literature, and music, she spent any free time she had in museums, art galleries, and opera houses.\nShe enjoyed the companionship of her baby. She used to take him with her on bicycle rides in and around Copenhagen tucked into the baby's seat on the front of her bicycle.\nWhen the war clouds gathered and broke into World War II, our missionaries were called home. The first available space that President Garff could obtain to transport his wife, little son, and several Scandinavian missionaries to home shores was on a tramp steamer. President Garff had to remain to reorganize the mission on a local basis. We can well imagine the anxiety of that parting. Faith alone made it possible. The ship had to take a northern route up around Iceland for safety. The voyage lasted seventeen days and the passage was unusually rough. Gertrude and the baby arrived home in November, in time to spend thanksgiving with her father and mother. By Christmas, President Garff returned safely and the little family was grateful to be reunited.\nThe following January 1940, Sister Garff was appointed a member of the General Board of Relief Society under its new president, Amy Brown Lyman. Sister Garff and Sister Lyman had developed a close friendship in Europe which Sister Lyman was presiding over the women's auxiliaries of the European mission. Sister Garff has said of her many occasions that she doesn't know how she could have carried on her great responsibilities had it not been for Sister Lyman's frequent letters of direction and encouragement. Sister Lyman's deep understanding of people and their problems, with her helpful disposition made it natural for Gertrude to turn to her for counsel and advice. She was very happy to be called into a continued association with so noble a character.\nSister Garff is friendly and approachable. She works well with people. She has the courage of her convictions, yet is pliable to the extent that if she is shown a better way she willingly accepts it. She attacks each assignment with an open-mindedness intelligence.\nGertrude and Mark have three young children: Mark R. (eight years), Charlotte (four years), and baby Georgia (one and one-half years). These human treasures along with her splendid husband receive her untiring devotion.\nFrom her husband, her father, and her mother, she will receive maximum support in her new position."

What greater gift could help the world Than this a fine and noble son?\nAmy Brown Lyman\nGeneral President of Relief Society, January 1940 April 1945\nPresident Belle S. Spafford\nDURING the past 103 years, eight women, each richly endowed with leadership strength and possessing a strong testimony of the truth of the restored gospel, have presided over the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. One of the foremost of these distinguished leaders is Amy Brown Lyman, eighth general president of the Society.\nSister Lyman became a member of the Relief Society General Board in 1909. Her capabilities, fine spirit, zeal, and willingness to serve brought consistent advancement for her. In 1911 she was appointed assistant general secretary. This appointment was followed successively by her appointment as general secretary (1913-21), general secretary-treasurer (1921-1928), counselor to Louise Y. Robison in the general presidency (1928-39), and general president (1940-45).\nHer administration has covered a momentous and unusually trying period in the history of the Society. Almost immediately upon taking over her duties as president, Sister Lyman, with the aid of her capable Board, enthusiastically initiated plans for an appropriate observance of the Relief Society centennial, two years away, including completion of the membership campaign which had been launched in 1935 for the purpose of enlisting 100,000 members by 1942. Straight thinking,\nhistory of the Society and appreciation for the past, as well as a clear, certain, hopeful outlook upon the future, coupled with a fine understanding of the purposes of the Society and its meaning in the lives of Latter-day Saint women were needed to direct plans and activities for this important event. Possessing all of these qualifications President Lyman was ideally suited to preside at this time, and she was heavily drawn upon.\nDue to the engagement of the United States in war, December 1941, all centennial plans did not mature; some were cancelled and the consummation of others delayed. However, there were many noteworthy and beneficial results from centennial activities. These, together with the graceful acceptance of the situation by Relief Society women and their ready adjustment to conditions are pronounced evidence of President Lyman's leadership strength.\nNot only did the war affect the centennial observance, it also brought about modifications in the regular Relief Society program. In accordance with recommendations of the First Presidency, whose counsel President Lyman profoundly respects and implicitly obeys, the program was greatly simplified and the recommended restrictions strictly observed. Moreover, her understanding of what is basic in the Society, her analytical mind and good judgment enabled her to meet these difficult problems and guide the Society through perilous and discouraging war years with outstanding success. In spite of the greatness of handicaps, high standards were maintained in regular Relief Society work, effective co-operation was given the Church Welfare Plan, a vast amount of war work was accomplished, and progressive action taken that will lighten the load of future leaders. Relief Society activities during the administration of Amy Brown Lyman reflect the genius of her leadership. Page  ALL of the contributions of Amy Brown Lyman to her Church and to society are too numerous and varied to even enumerate in the space here available. Her influence has been national and international; thousands have been the beneficiaries of her service. As a pioneer in the field of social-welfare work she is pre-eminent among her contemporaries. Her efforts to alleviate human suffering, to promote family solidarity, and to develop improved methods of helping people out of trouble have been consistent, continuous, intelligent, and successful. Her love for women has expressed itself in tireless efforts in their behalf. She has worked diligently to create better understanding of their needs and interests, and to secure improved opportunities and greater consideration for them in the fields of education, industry, and the professions. She has actively affiliated herself with the National and International Councils of Women, holding responsible positions and favorably identifying herself with great women leaders of this and foreign nations. Mrs. Lyman has been the friend of children, actively participating in securing legislation providing for better maternity and infancy care. She has co-operated in the establishment of milk depots, encouraged well-baby and health clinics, and promoted and fostered sound child-welfare programs and practices. She has been sympathetic toward the underprivileged and handicapped and has programmed intelligently for them. Instrumental in the establishment of the American Fork Training School, she served for twelve years as a member of its board of trustees. Amy Lyman has valued and advanced education and encouraged learning. She recognizes the power of education to help people appreciate life and adjust to it. She herself is a gifted teacher. She also has an avid interest in history and its careful and accurate preservation. As general secretary of Relief Society she collected, indexed, and preserved valuable records and prepared comprehensive record books for use in wards and stakes. She has also been instrumental in the collection and preservation of pictures and other materials of historical value to the Society. As a missionary, Sister Lyman has borne her testimony in many lands, taught the gospel she so dearly loves, and enriched many, many lives. She refers to her missionary labors as \"a joy, a satisfaction, and an inspiration throughout.\" Fortunate are those who work with Amy Brown Lyman. She possesses rare administrative ability. She unselfishly magnifies her associates, inspiring them with confidence in themselves by readily recognizing their strengths and the value of their work, and by turning full credit and honor back to them. She loyally upholds those who she appoints, at the same tie aiding in their development and wisely guiding and directing their activities. As her successor in the general presidency of the Relief Society, I am grateful for the opportunities and training she has given me. I regard my association with her as among the richest experiences of my life. I admire her devotion to the gospel. I admire her devotion to the gospel. I appreciate the vision she has given me of Relief Society work. I love her for the charm of her personality, her sense of humor, her deep understanding of human nature, her loyalty to her friends and to the right, her courage, and her many personal kindnesses to me. I honor her for her true greatness of character."

Sartori From unnamed mountains marred with violence You write \"How are the hills of home this year?\" A tendril groping for some permanence To twine beyond the loaded bandoleer Here are the counterparts of memory. The canyon, cleft within your exiled brain. The misted peaks, become reality. I troll the ageless certitudes again Down to you from a wind-washed eminence Where russet soil has settled on this tier Of rock. The evergreen still drives its lance Into the sky, a changeless cavalier. The butterflies thread woods along the stream. Woof of the forest and weft of your dream. Assurance of unaltered majesty In the long-lived profile of a precipice, I send, and faith no stricken earth nor tree Shall disillusion your returning eyes.... Upon the northern slope, the aspen stems Glow silver-green, pale as a luna moth; The fern is beaded lace between the hems And petticoats of cool and living cloth. This boulder sheltered daisies small as these The age, when under Pinta's listing spars, Mutinous eyes, from strange and fearful seas, Were lifted to the same familiar stars. On some dark retina, now dust, once lay Horizons I delineate today. Marcia Knowlton Howells First Counselor in the General Presidency, 1940-45 President Amy Brown Lyman MARCIA K. HOWELLS DAUGHTER of a Relief Society stake president and relative of one of the two elders who assisted the Prophet Joseph Smith at the organization meeting of the Relief Society, Marcia Knowlton Howells has, since her childhood days, been familiar with Relief Society work and activities, and she has always loved, appreciated, and honored this great woman's auxiliary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Her mother, Minerva Richards Knowlton, was a life-long member of the Society and served for many years with distinction as Relief Society Page 272 president of Davis Stake, which at that time covered the whole of Davis County. In addition to traveling about, supervising and directing the welfare, health, and civic activities in this progressive unit. Sister Knowlton planned and prepared the courses of study used in her wards. The General Board at that time did not provide, as it does today, a uniform course of study, and stakes were left to prepare their own work. Marcia, no doubt, remembers seeing her mother work long hours and far into the night over her outlines, after a hard day of household activities. Her grandfather's uncle. Dr. Willard Richards, accompanied Joseph Smith and John Taylor to that important meeting in Nauvoo, Illinois, on March 17, 1842, when the Relief Society was organized, and assisted by acting as temporary secretary until the organization was effected and Eliza R. Snow was appointed permanent secretary. His name is listed among the seven donors who, on that memorable occasion, made charity contributions and thus established the first charity fund of the Society. With this unusual Relief Society background, a rich heritage in itself for a Relief Society worker, with her long years of service in the organization, and with her exceptional ability, Sister Howells has been able to make outstanding contributions to MARCIA KNOWLTON HOWELLS 273 the Relief Society cause in both ward and stake as well as on the General Board. I first met Marcia Knowlton at the summer cottage of Sister Heber J. Grant at Brighton where we were both guests. I was immediately attracted to her because of her charming and interesting personality, her fine qualities of heart and mind, and her boundless energy and interest in life. And from that time on I have loved and admired her and have enjoyed association with her as a fellow worker in civic and Church activities. SISTER HOWELLS was called to the General Board of Relief Society on February 2, 1929, and on January 1, 1940 was appointed first counselor in the general presidency. As a Board member she has given generously of her time to important committee work, and has traveled extensively throughout the Church attending stake and mission conferences and conventions. Her work in the general presidency has been largely of an administrative nature. As manager of the temple and burial clothes department and general director of the Mormon Handicraft Shop, she has demonstrated unusual executive and managerial ability, carrying forward her labors in these connections with efficiency, diligence, and dispatch, and achieving, withal, phenomenal success. Directing the work of these two important departments, always a challenge, has been especially taxing the last few years because of the shortage of materials and merchandise and because of war restrictions; but Sister Howells has always regarded this assignment as a rare privilege which she has enjoyed. She appreciates the distinctive and important service and opportunity these projects provide or offer to the people of the Church. As a member of the general Church Welfare committee, with special assignment to the clothing committee, and as work director on the General Board, Sister Howells has given time and attention to the clothing and sewing plans of the Church Welfare program, and to the sewing activities which are carried on in the regular work meetings of the Society. She has also assisted with the preparation of that portion of the General Welfare budget which has to do with the clothing program. Sister Howells has represented the General Board in many community activities, notably those which have had to do with health and welfare work. She was state chairman of the May Day Child Health Day in 1939. She is at present a valued member of the executive committee of the board of directors of the Utah Tuberculosis Association. She recently helped to direct the establishment of the splendid library of which the U. S. O. Of Salt Lake City has been so proud. In 1939, she attended the National Conference of Social Workers at San Francisco, following which she attended a social service institute at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1941 in company with Sister Donna D. Sorensen, she represented the Society at the biennial meeting of the National Council of Women. Sister Howells has been a wise, safe, and helpful counselor. Blessed with intelligence, broad experience, and sound judgment, and fortified with a burning testimony of the gospel and with an understanding of the responsibilities and obligations resting upon those who serve in a Church capacity, she has been able to recognize the relative importance and value of the many questions and problems presented for consideration and action, and to help to make wise, reasonable, and safe decisions. She is an able presiding officer and a gifted and fluent public speaker, with an excellent vocabulary. She gave promise of these fine qualities of leadership when, as a young woman, she served as president of her class at the L.D.S. high school, and as vice-president of the student body of that institution; also later during her four-year period of teaching.\nShe was educated in the public schools of Farmington, at the L.D.S. high school and University of Utah, preparing herself for the teaching profession at the latter institution. In 1910, she was married to Dr. Thomas J. Howells, a leading physician of the State, and an able and progressive specialist in the field of public health. He was for many years the Salt Lake City health commissioner, in which position he gave excellent service, and is at present a member of the State Board of Health.\nSister Howells is a generous, devoted, and unselfish friend. She is never happier than when doing something for others. When her friends are in trouble she is among the first to visit and comfort them. I count it as one of the distinctive privileges of my life to associate with and share work with Marcia Knowlton Howells. MEADOW LARK Grace M. Candland Returning friend of early spring, I hear Your call from low, green marsh and leafing tree, A lilting song of joyous melody Divinely sweet to each attentive ear. And then my heart grows light, I seem to know That His kind care, perhaps, had thought of me. And of my need of just such ecstacy When clouds obscured the way that I should go. May I, like you, blithe messenger, renew In some despairing life the will to see That lowly things send forth incessantly A song of life that thrills one through and through. Dear meadowlark, your floating notes of bliss Are one rare treat I would not care to miss. Vera White Pohlman General Secretary-Treasurer, 1940-45 President Belle S, Spafford FEW persons called to a position of trust and responsibility come to that position better qualified through native ability, training, and experience than did Vera White Pohlman when, in January 1940, she was called to serve as general secretary-treasurer of Relief Society. Thoroughly familiar with the history, rulings, and policies of the Society, acquainted with General Board office procedures, having a knowledge of the requirements of Reliei Society Magazine work, and intimate with the work of the Relief Society welfare department through twelve years of previous service in the general offices, her Relief Society background was rich. Prior to her appointment as general secretary-treasurer she had served with the Salt Lake County Department of Public Welfare, where she organized recording and filing systems and supervised the stenographic and clerical staff. She had also been employed as statistician with the State Emergency Relief Administration (F. E. R. A.) which was succeeded by the State Department of Public Welfare, where she served as director of its bureau of research and statistics, contributing much to the development and establishment of its policies and procedures, and to the training of personnel in this new function of state government in Utah. VERA W. POHLMAN All of this experience was invaluable in her Relief Society assignment which had so much to do with welfare work, important record keeping, the formulating and establishment of rulings, policies, and procedures, and the training of personnel. At the time of the appointment of Vera W. Pohlman as general secretary-treasurer, Mrs. Amy W. Evans wrote of her: \"With her natural ability for details, her experience in welfare work, her fund of information regarding and thorough understanding of all phases of Relief Society work, her faithfulness to trust, and her dependability, Mrs. Pohlman will make a very efficient and valuable general secretary.\" Page  This prognostication has indeed been fulfilled. Her record of efficient service to the Society in this responsible position will ever stand a credit to her and a blessing to the Relief Society. Vera W. Pohlman has a brilliant and an analytical mind. She has a marvelous capacity not only to quickly and clearly see a problem or a situation, but to see all that is in any way related to it; she readily recognizes the influence of one situation upon another and can accurately foresee results of action. This rare capacity has made her of inestimable value in executive councils, in committee work, and as a member of the General Board, enabling her to arrive at sound conclusions and to guide others to do likewise. Mrs. Pohlman is a tireless, enduring worker. No amount of time or effort is considered, nor is any thought of saving herself allowed to enter into the performance of her duties. During the early years of her incumbency as general secretary-treasurer when, in addition to the regular duties incident to this position, she was reorganizing the offices and setting up new and more economical and efficient systems of management, she also carried a tremendous responsibility and did a vast amount of work in connection with Relief Society centennial plans and activities. During this period she worked long into the night, denying herself recreation and relaxation. Every minute was devoted to duty. THERE are few people who take greater pride in their work than does Vera Pohlman. Careful, painstaking, accurate effort accompanies all that she does from the smallest unimportant bit of work to the heaviest and most essential of tasks. Perfection is her standard of measurement. Vera fully appreciates the importance of the Relief Society cause. She loves the women of the Church and has a sincere desire to serve them. She continuously strives to make things clear, easy, and convenient for them, and she is never happier than when she feels she has been of service. She has met with thousands of Relief Society women in her visits to the stakes and missions of the Church. In 1943 she traveled continuously from early September until mid-December, meeting with Relief Society women representing 142 stakes and missions. The many expressions of appreciation for these visits bear evidence of the regard felt for her by Relief Society women because of her efficiency and knowledge of Relief Society work, and of their love and admiration for her because of her willingness to serve them. Special mention should here be made of a few of Mrs. Pohlman's special contributions to Relief Society. She has prepared new, simplified visiting teacher report books, and has revised ward and stake record books. The revised record books allow for the inclusion of valuable information, much of which was formerly not included, particularly with regard to the sewing program. This information permits a clear picture of the status of all phases of Relief Society work and materially aids the General Board to better plan and more effectively direct the Society. Mrs. Pohlman's personal ability to interpret figures and give them life and vitality is a rare gift.\nIn 1941, she prepared family record forms for use of Relief Society presidents in making a family analysis. These forms, endorsed by the Church Welfare Plan, are in use at the present time and are a guide and an asset to Relief Society presidents in analyzing the situation of families under care and in making sound recommendations to bishops regarding family needs.\nRelief Society publications have benefited by the skills and knowledge of Vera W. Pohlman. She is a gifted writer, meticulous in the preparation of material for publication and is familiar with technical publishing details. She has continuously edited \"Notes From the Field\" department in TheShe has also made many other contributions to the content of the Magazine, and has effectively directed and supervised its business management. She assisted in the planning and preparation of Our Legacy Relief Society Anthology of Verse and also A Centenary of Relief Society published by the General Board in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of the Society. In the latter, the section titled \"Relief Society Work\" which involved considerable research, was written by Mrs. Pohlman. She also aided in the preparation of other centennial souvenirs.\nRelief Society will long benefit from official bulletins prepared by Mrs. Pohlman for the local Societies. They have contained instructions and rulings, and have clarified policies and procedures.\nHer minutes of General Board meetings are a clear, detailed, accurate, well-written account of proceedings and General Board action. She views minutes as important historical records and she has taught secretaries of the local Societies to so regard them. One of Mrs. Pohlman's outstanding accomplishments has been to give these secretaries a vision of the importance of their work, and a training in the keeping of complete and precise records.\nVera W. Pohlman is sincerely appreciative of commendation but in no way solicits it. She is genuinely spiritual. She believes in Christian brotherhood and practices it. Her beneficences are many and always quietly performed. She is fair and just, a delightful traveling companion, loyal to her friends and devoted to her family. She is true to every trust and faithful to her Church. Her enduring values and abiding have enduring value. FOREVER BEAUTY Anna Prince Redd Imperishable, still In summer time I see. Each shining poem-tree In winter dawn. Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, May 1 and May 15, 1885. \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion, and the Rights of the Women of All Nations\" What Can A Woman Do? No doubt many members of the Institute have wondered what vocation in life they should adopt by means of which they could earn their own livelihood, thus promoting self-reliance and the ability to do something sufficiently remunerative to enable them to fight the battle of life single-handed, if necessity required it, or circumstances compelled them to do so. As there is always a possibility that reverses may come to all of us is it not wisdom to give some consideration to this subject? It would be impossible to define just what course any member should follow to become entirely successful; in this matter, as in many others, we must be our own judges. One thing I can say with certainty, and that is this: In making up our minds we should not adopt any kind of labor in the slightest degree degrading. Whatever we try to do, let it be the labor we love; something we can do enthusiastically. People are rarely successful who work mechanically. Some persons have thought, and do so now, that the only labors a woman should perform must be of a domestic character; that to be a household drudge is all she is capable of being; but such persons must be told that at the present time there are hundreds of ladies in the civilized world making themselves famous as authors, physicians, surgeons, public speakers, painters, sculptors and lawyers. The advanced situation of the women of today grants to her all the privileges she may seek to enjoy; and if for any reason she does not choose to marry, there is no law to compel her to do so. This being the case she should know how to take care of herself, and earn her own living...  C. R. S.  A Pleasant Party. Editor Exponent: One of the most enjoyable affairs that ever happened in Deseret came off on the 2d of April in the form of a surprise party in honor of the Prest. Of our Society at the Relief Hall. Sister Eliza Whicker has been president of this society for seven years, and is a noble and well respected sister. The tables were spread with a sumptuous repast and the company seated when our beloved President arrived. After dinner the ceremonies were continued by presenting Sister Whicker with a neatly gotten up and appropriate address in a suitable frame, and several other presents by the sisters, followed by a programme, consisting of speeches, songs and recitations Sister Whicker addressed those present for a short time, thanking the sisters for their kindness; said she prized the address more than gold or silver. A vote of thanks was then returned to the committee for their exertions, and the entertainment closed with singing and prayer. Respectfully, Mary A. Bishop, Secretary. Deseret, Millard Co., April 8, 1885. The exhibition of Decorative Art work at Young Bro's on Main St., which commenced on May 12th, and has been continued since up, to the present, is something wonderful in the way of ornamentation, and requiring less natural ingenuity, it would seem, than embroidery done by hand. Everything, large or small, can be executed on the Domestic machine, on satin, silk, plush, canvas, etc., with chenile, arrasene, crewels, embroidery silk, tinsel, applique, mosaic and etching. Crowds of people were attracted every day to see the handsome and elaborate display of goods, and to watch those who were engaged in running the machines, doing all sorts of fancy ornamental work of different varieties and patterns with the people looking over in wonder and amazement. Surely this is something under the sun. Page 278 Woman's Sphere Ramona W.

She was active in the Commission to Study the Organization of the Peace, as also in the Association to Aid Scientific Research by Women, and in the American Committee on International Intellectual Co-operation. PARIS expects to lead the world again in fashions. Before all the Germans were driven out of France, forty style salons in the capital were presenting fashion shows. Women came to them on bicycles and shivered in the unheated rooms. THE First White House Conference on Rural Education has been held at the instance of Charl O. Williams, competent woman director of the Field Service of National Education Association. Fifty-two per cent of the Nation's teachers are rural. Their average salary is $967 a year. Per capita, Washington charwomen receive more than do 44,000 teachers. AFTER doing a magnificent job of flying   principally ferrying army aircraft  the WASPS (Women Airforce Service Pilots) have been disbanded. Though their work was one of the most dangerous kinds and required highly skilled women, they were never given military status as were other women's military organizations.

Page 279 \n\nVOL. 32 MAY 1945 NO. 5 Relief Society Achievements 1944-45 THE month of May brings to a close the Relief Society educational season. In spite of curtailments and handicaps due to the war, the 1944-45 season has been a successful one marked by unusual development for Relief Society women and great accomplishment for the Society. With few exceptions, high standards have been maintained in all phases of the work, and Relief Society workers may justifiably view this past season with satisfaction and pride. The General Board sincerely appreciates the efforts of Relief Society officers and class leaders as well as the strength of Relief Society membership. It commends each one for her devotion to the Society, for the time, energy, and ability she has given to the work, and for the part she has played in the growth and advancement of Relief Society. It recognizes the support Relief Society women have given to the war programs sponsored by the Society, and the service they have rendered in their respective communities. The elements which make any organization successful are good beginnings or a sound foundation, a purposeful and worthy program, a capable leadership, and a devoted membership. Relief Society has all of these. It was organized by the Prophet \"under the Priesthood after Page 280 the pattern of the Priesthood.\" No more worthy objectives could animate any organization; namely, to develop its members spiritually and intellectually, and \"to manifest benevolence irrespective of creed or nationality.\" For more than one hundred years the leadership of Relief Society, including the general, stake, mission, and local leaders, under the direction of the Priesthood has been sincere, energetic, capable and above average; and no organization could boast of a more devoted membership? women who are bound together by the ties of the gospel and who value their organization as an auxiliary of the Church and as a medium through which women may attain full self-realization and render satisfying service. To be a part of such an organization is a blessing and a privilege. True, in the process of performing our part, those of us who have contributed to the onward march of the Society during the past season may have met with discouragements and with obstacles which have had to be surmounted under difficulties, but the surmounting of these, rather than retarding us, has actually developed and strengthened us. In total, the benefits that have accrued from efforts put forth should leave Relief Society women satisfied and happy at the end of this educational season. BSS. Howard S. McDonald Appointed President of B.Y.U. THE First Presidency announced on Wednesday, March 14, 1945, following a meeting of the board of trustees of the Brigham Young University, the appointment of Howard S. McDonald as the new president of the Brigham Young University to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Dr. Franklin S. Harris who resigned to become president of the Utah State Agricultural College at Logan. Mr. McDonald has served as superintendent of schools in Salt Lake City since July 1 of last year. In that short period of time he has made an outstanding record of achievement in this position. Previous to that appointment he was deputy superintendent of San Francisco schools.\nPresident McDonald is a devoted member of the Church. He was a missionary in the Eastern States, a stake M.I.A. and Sunday School officer in both the Cache and San Francisco Stakes, and served as counselor in the San Francisco Stake for five years before becoming president of that stake. His wife is the former Ella Gibbs of Brigham City. They have two daughters.\nThe General Board of Relief Society extends its congratulations both to President McDonald and also to the Brigham Young University on his appointment.\nRelief Society members appreciate the opportunity of sending their sons and daughters to a college where not only courses in higher education are offered but, in addition, a training and association are provided which are not found elsewhere and which may prove a potent force in the lives of their children in strengthening and increasing their testimonies of the gospel.\n?M.C.S.\n ERRATUM MARY SMITH ELLSWORTH NOT RELEASED An error was made in a statement in The, page 185, wherein it stated \"Mary Smith Ellsworth, recently released president of Relief Societies of the Northern California Mission...\" It is deeply regretted that this mistake was made and apologies are extended to Sister Ellsworth for any embarrassment which this misstatement may have caused her. Sister Ellsworth is continuing her splendid work as the president of the Relief Societies of the Northern California Mission, He's Coming Home, Let's Spruce Up! The Honorable Earl J. Glade Mayor of Salt Lake City Prepared at the Request of the Church Beautification Committee WITH 30,000 of Salt Lake City's sons and daughters scattered to the far reaches of the wide, wide world, and sacrificing their comforts of home and their associations with loved ones, and sometimes giving their very lives, it is indeed difficult for us on the home front to focus our thinking on the centennial celebration for 1947. A grateful Utah capital city is earnestly praying that, surely by then, this crushing, devastating war will be over, and our own brave boys and girls will be right here again in the old home town. But ours must be an alert home town! It must be not only on its toes; Salt Lake City must be on its tip-toes! If the 173,218 Salt Lakers will all just catch the spirit of homecoming, it will not be such a Gargantuan job to make a brilliant centennial showing. Here's How: Every home owner should take a 1945 spring inventory of \"dress-up musts\" and give them the works! New parking to be seeded; new concrete walks to be laid; a new roof for the home; two coats of fresh paint all around. Aged and decaying trees should come down. Alleys should be cleaned. During 1945 and 1946, neighborhood should vie Page 282 with neighborhood in this great home-coming dress-up! We shall be doing it for our own ?the best youngsters in the world! What we say for Salt Lake City, of course, goes also for every town in the State. The proposed 1947 centennial might well catch the spirit oi a great homecoming celebration/ Just as the pioneers in 1847 found their haven in Salt Lake valley, so, too, will our own young men and young women in the armed services be grateful?yes, unspeakably glad to be home. Business and Industry on the Job, Too! Just as each home must step out and dress up, so, too, must business and industry?new store front, new display windows, new interiors, new and finer signs. Down with shacks and dumps! Out with rubbish and junk! City, county, and State administrations must tie in with each other in selling their respective communities as being good places in which to locate new industries. Surely, by 1947, there will be some determinations regarding Geneva Steel which, if good fortune breaks just right, may prove the basis of an entire new economy for the Inter-mountain Empire. The newly electrified Northwest of Seattle and Portland will want Utah steel for their rapidly growing manufacturing industries, which will also undoubtedly help largely to supply a new China and a new Russia, as well as the great new Westl Salt Lake City Also to the Front! HE'S COMING HOME, LET'S SPRUCE UP! 283 The city corporation must also bend every effort to meet this call for a home-coming spruce-up. To the very utmost of our finances must our highways be put in shape. The incumbent administration is devoting its energies to getting the city out of debt and at the same time carrying on municipal improvements every way in its power. This is a Herculean task! At this time, new, large feeder water mains are being laid to take care of the homes on the higher east and north bench elevations. Salt Lake City parks are being put in the finest shape in their history. The mile track in Liberty Park, for instance, is being paved this year. And an ambitious paving program, together with extensive improvements, is also proceeding in the City Cemetery. Salt Lake City seriously needs an auditorium of ample capacity. Such a structure would provide the locale and facilities for many new community achievements. The easy way to finance this vital need would be to go in debt for it, by bonding. We are hopeful of being able to find another way, for borrowing would just add to our financial slavery. Our present bond retirement plan is a courageous one, and if strictly adhered to, will get our city reasonably out of debt in a few years. Utah's capital city must do its share to prepare for the great centennial home-coming. By getting the utmost out of every dollar expended, great achievement in city beautification can be wrought. Possibly, pending developments in municipal financing on which we are earnestly working, will help us also to meet the perennial community stumper: \"Well, Mayor, what are we going to use for money?\" Maybe, one of these days, we'll surprise the man who throws that question at us, by having an answer ready that will be an answer. Let's just see! All-Year Care of the Rose Beds Hazel D. Moyle \"A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose? says that woman poet, Gertrude Stein, meaning, no doubt, that to say it is a rose is enough, for does not all mankind acknowledge the rose as the acme of perfection, the queen of all flowers! The back-yard flower gardener might, however, be inclined to add a more practical word or two to this poetic roundelay. Well do we know that roses do not grow in such obliging and supreme beauty unless we follow a few rules and regulations. We may purchase the finest and newest modern rose bush, guaranteed to be bigger and better than any other ever seen, but if we do not give that plant a little regular care, its blooms may prove to be disappointing. Roses do demand certain attentions, but few other flowers give such generous returns for the little they do demand. The plants often live and flower abundantly each year for a lifetime, requiring no replanting, resetting or dividing. The modern hybrid tea rose, which is the type now planted so universally in our gardens, blooms not once a year, but it often sends out two, three, and even four crops of flowers in a single season. Fall roses rival those of June in our Utah gardens, some rose lovers actually claiming that they excel the earlier crops. With the cooler weather, their colors are even richer and more brilliant than during the warm June days. Page 284 The attentions that roses demand are simple, the important point is, they must be given regularly. First of all comes the job of uncovering the plants in early spring (that is, if you live in a cold section where they need winter protection). Begin loosening the coverings as soon as the hard freezing is over, but do not actually remove it on the first warm day. Gradually uncover so that the tender wood which has been covered all winter can become accustomed to air and cooler temperatures. Likewise, do not cut the long old wood back until the buds begin to swell. Go slowly, even though you are impatient to begin work, because of late cold snaps of weather. But do not put off pruning until the top buds are actually growing actively, for this will take much of the stored-up strength of the plant which will then be lost as the plants are cut back. Consider all these conditions well, then use your best judgment as to the best time to begin. In pruning the hybrid tea roses, cut out all the weak and crooked branches at their base, preserving only the heavy strong canes. Cut out also any that grow toward the center and interfere with sun and air. Then shorten those you have selected to remain from eight to twelve inches. Sometimes winter has already done this and we have no choice but to cut away the dead wood down to the remaining plump buds. In colder sections the entire top growth may have been killed, but be comforted and cut away the dead wood even so, for fresh new growth will soon spring from the roots and you will still reap roses come year. A later, but perhaps an even better crop.\nCLIMBING roses need little pruning in early spring except the cutting away of dead wood ... and be warned that it is often difficult to detect just how much is actually dead. Leave your climbers strictly alone until growth actually begins so that you can be spared the sad experience of finding that you have removed branches that would otherwise be sporting a crop of lovely roses when June comes.\nThe best time to trim the climbers is just after they have bloomed. Such varieties as \"American Pillar\" and \"American Beauty Climber\" should have the old canes that have just bloomed cut away at the base to make room for the vigorous new shoots that will be found springing up from the root. These old canes of this type of climber do not bloom again and merely encumber the plant with dead wood. Get them out of the way as soon as possible after they have flowered. Such strong, large-flowered climbers as \"Silver Moon\" and \"Dr. Van Fleet\" need only the removal of the oldest wood occasionally after they have become established, to prevent the plant from spreading and also to keep it vital and alive. If left too long without this attention, it becomes almost impossible to remove old dead branches that will gradually choke it to death. These varieties need restraining as they mature (after two or three years' growth).\nA thorough cultivation of the soil of the rose bed is of the greatest importance as soon as it is workable in spring, and this will bring to light many pests that have buried themselves during the winter. Many claim that this is the best defense against the rose beetle, most devastating of all rose pests. Cultivate and stir right up to the base of each plant and stir in any mulch of manure that you may have been able to apply over the winter.\nAnd now we come to that subject of regular care which roses demand throughout the entire summer: cultivation, watering, and spraying. Of these three, cultivating comes first. We must keep the soil from getting hard and baked and firm, for the plants must have air, food, and moisture. Water will not penetrate unless the surface is kept loose and open, and our plants will then sulk and produce poor, slimy blooms. By beginning early and cultivating regularly the day following each watering, when the soil will again have sufficient aeration, this task is made easy, and it will at the same time prevent all weeds from growing.\nUse a long-handled, three-pronged cultivator, or any other convenient small tool that will suit your taste, but wield it often and regularly so that your soil will remain loose and open. A mulch of either old, well-rotted manure or of peat moss, or even of lawn clippings can be a great help in keeping the soil from baking, and this will also keep the ground cool and prevent weeds and conserve moisture. If we are fortunate enough to be able to put a two-inch layer of manure, then this will also act as a mild and steady feeding, as well as making an excellent mulch. Roses need rich fare, and they especially thrive on manure. Chemical fertilizers can be applied, too, if the manure is not easily procured, but these must be used strictly according to directions of the brand you select. In using this type of fertilizer, first loosen the top soil, then scatter the fertilizer in a circle about each plant, then apply a deep watering immediately. Such an application can be applied in the spring, and repeated two weeks after the first crop of bloom is over. Rose plants need plenty of moisture, although water should be applied by soaking deeply instead of sprinkling. Remove the nozzle from the hose and allow to run until the ground is well saturated. Then leave the beds until they begin to dry out before applying more moisture. Such a watering will last for a week's time if it is followed by a cultivation the following day. Pest control is also a regular requirement. The best control is to apply one of the all-purpose sprays available at all nursery stores, beginning with an early application as soon as the leaves have begun to open well, and continuing at two-week intervals during the growing season. By sucha program, one can prevent the many ills and pernicious pests from getting started. Remember that no matter what chemical spray or dust you use, it must be applied from underneath so that it reaches the underside of the leaves as well as the upper parts, for it is there that most of the creatures hide out. And the entire plant must be covered to catch any of the chewing insects no matter where they attack. Should your plants show signs of mildew?our most common plant disease, which manifests itself in a grayish, powder-like substance coating the leaves, use Massey dust, also secured at the nursery store, and if this is not procurable, apply dusting sulphur with a dust gun, coating the entire plant and repeating the application until the trouble disappears. There is one pest for which we have as yet found no cure. The villainous rose beetle appears in early June, just as your most lovely roses are coming into full flower, and it thrusts its terrible, long proboscis or beak into the very heart of the flower, despoiling and completely ruining its exquisite perfection. You must hand pick this creature if you would be free from its devastation. Arm yourself with a small pail of water and a little kerosene, then go forth to battle. Shake or flip each black, small bug (you will find them sitting stupidly among your treasures), into the water where it will drown. Its only redeeming feature is that the rose bug does not remain long, but eventually disappears, digging itself into the ground to lay its eggs for another generation of trouble for the next year. The early cultivation of the soil which we advised above will bring to light and destroy these new generations of this pest Active cultivation and feeding of the rose plants should stop after mid-August so that the wood may ripen and harden to withstand winter. New, soft growth will not withstand hard freezing. Winter pro-(Concluded on page 320) Ten Miles to Calico Martha Robeson Wlight PART II THE next morning none of the neighbors showed signs of making a midweek trip to Og-den. The rutted road past the dugout remained empty. At breakfast, her father squinted quizzically at Tilda. 'Figgered how you're goin' to get your wheat to town?\" *Tt*s a problem/ she admitted. \"But I got to?today.\" \"A squaw would drag it on poles ?a travois.\" Tilda stared at her father. A shiver of delight rippled over her? not just because his suggestion was practical, but because of what it signified. First he had offered the twine. Now he'd got the answer to her transportation problem. Then her face fell. \"I don't know how you make a travois.\" \"I'll show you after breakfast.\" And as soon as he finished eating, he brought the axe. \"We'll fix your drag now, Tildy.\" While he selected and cut the right size willows, she yanked and slashed off wild grapevines to serve as ropes. When the travois was finished, it had a lashed platform for the wheat and a pair of shafts for Tilda. She cleaned herself up, braided her hair, and put on the hat her mother had woven for her from pond rushes. Ma brought a lunch?two pieces of cornbread and a cucumber?wrapped in a piece of flour sack. Pa carried out the wheat and placed it on the travois platform. Tilda laid her lunch beside the sack. She was dressed in her Sunday homespun, and wore her shoes. \"Take your flipper,\" ma directed. \"You might meet something.\" Tilda laughed, but she stowed the slingshot and a handful of pebbles in her skirt pocket. Pulling the drag along the road, Tilda pretended she was an Indian girl on the way to greet her warrior lover. She threw her hat on the wheat and hung her long braids over her breasts. With her belt and a turkey feather she found, she made an Indian headband. She had just donned it when old Bishop Robinson rode i|p behind her. \"Mornin', Gal,\" he said heartily. He had twinkling eyes. \"Good morning. Bishop Robinson.\" He cocked his gray head to one side. \"Let's see. Whose gal you be? I can't place all these children growing up so fast.\" \"I'm Mathilda Dawson.\" \"To be sure. Say, what you got there, Sister Tildy?\" \"A bushel of wheat I gleaned. I'm taking it to town.\" \"It's a right hot day for dragging. To save you the trip to Ogden I'll give you two dollars for your wheat.\" Tilda remembered that though the bishop was a righteous worker for the Lord, he had the reputation of being a shrewd trader. Page  \"What say, Tildy?\" he prompted. \"Whose field did you glean?\" \"Brother Burnett's/' \"He grows good wheat. Tell you, I'll make it three dollars.\" She didn't want to offend Frank's grandfather. She must refuse politely. \"Thank you, Bishop, but I got to take this to town.\" \"Why's that?\" The old man shifted his weight in the saddle. \"I got to buy me some calico dress goods.\" His wise eyes crinkled at the corners. \"Couldn't you buy the goods with the money? Easier than drag-gin' your sack so far.\" \"Calico's dear. Three dollars ain't enough.\" Would he be mad? He chuckled, \"That's the best I can offer. Well?\" She shook her head. \"Maybe you'll get more.\" He clucked to his horse. \"Giddap.\" The dust settled on Tilda. She plodded ahead. The heat grew intense and she stopped briefly to remove her shoes. It felt more comfortable to walk barefoot. Did squaws get this tired? After what seemed a very long time, she came to the river. She would have to carry the wheat across. Tilda caught up her skirts and fastened them around her waist with her belt. She pierced the feather through one of her braids. She unloaded the sack on a ledge jutting out from the river bank. Bending her shoulders, she hauled the heavy load onto her back, then walked cautiously into the shallow stream. The rocks on the bottom were slick. Minnows brushed against her legs. It was hard to keep her balance, but she reached the opposite bank and slid the sack to the ground. Tilda drew a long breath. She recrossed the river, got the travois and her shoes and hat, and brought them over, too. Now she'd eat her lunch. \"What's that you're so scared o' wettin', little Injun?\" A squat, red-headed man stepped from behind a tree. A tall, gray-haired man and a half-breed joined him. They had rifles. Tilda faced them defiantly, though she quaked inside. \"I'm no Indian,\" she said with dignity. \"This is wheat. I see you're strangers. If you are on your way to California, you're headed in the wrong direction. You go through Salt Lake.\" \"We done found that out,\" mumbled the gray-haired man. \"Boys, we can use that wheat, eh?\" 'An' take a load off the gal's shoulders,\" laughed Redhead. \"It's my wheat!\" Tilda crouched desperately over the sack. \"You get more,\" said the half-breed in threatening gutterals. The tall stranger roughly shoved the girl aside and slung the sack over his shoulder. \"Run back home or I'll smack you.\" Lowering her head like a goat, Tilda butted him. He stumbled and the wheat slid to the ground. But Redhead grabbed her arms. \"You big bullies!\" she sobbed, and kicked her captor's shins. \"Ain't you a hellion though!\" There was admiration in his tone. \"Now, Sis, skedaddle. Else I'll turn you over my knee and paddle you.\" A hot flood of mixed humiliation and rage engulfed Tilda. They went into the bushes with her wheat. TEN MILES TO CALICO 289 Two weeks of hard work! The tall man spoke to horses, then she heard wagon wheels creak. Tilda gulped her last sob. She wouldn't let them do it! She felt in her pocket for her flipper and pebbles. In a jiffy she put on her shoes. Those men didn't know this country. If she could make them think Indians were after them, they'd whip up their horses and maybe the jolting wagon would bounce the sack overboard. Keeping in the underbrush beside the rutted road, Tilda hurried after them as silently as she could run. She soon caught up to the walking team. Through the bushes she saw a covered wagon. The tall man drove. His companions rode saddle horses, in front and behind. She placed a stone in her slingshot, aimed carefully, and let go. \"Damned hornet!\" cursed the driver. Blood dripped from his cheek. \"No, that warn't a hornet, what was it?\" Tilda smiled grimly. In quick succession she fired her second and third shots. The half-breed and Redhead swore in pain. \"That must've been a arrow creased me!\" howled the driver. The girl started yelling, in imitation of Indian war whoops. She took deep breaths, opened her mouth wide and patted her palm against it. Tilda shot more jagged pebbles, and dodged about in the bushes. She made a great commotion, but stayed hidden. Redhead wheeled his mount beside the driver and shouted, \"To save our scalps we gotta leave the wagon! Climb on behind me!\" The half-breed was already in panic-stricken flight. The tall man and Redhead fled after him into. The underbrush. This was much more than Tilda had hoped. She ran to the wagon, scrambled to the seat, and started the horses at a brisk trot toward town. She'd deliver her wheat in style. In half an hour she backed up before Horrock's elevated unloading platform. As Tilda wrapped the lines around the brake handle, Frank Robinson came out of the store. Her successful coup against the three thieves made her feel like swaggering a little. She waved casual recognition to Frank so he'd know that he didn't matter any more. \"Hello!\" she called. He stood staring. Tilda climbed over the seat into the bed of the wagon and tugged her sack of wheat to the low tailgate. She poised there to step off onto the platform. The team moved and she lost her balance. Girl and wheat tumbled to the ground together, landing in thick dust. Her skirts were partly over her head. The old sack burst, and she was half buried in grain. The fall didn't hurt Tilda. Her first thought was of how she must look. She sat up and frantically yanked down her petticoats. She was so mad that she began to bawIl like a roped calf. Several men had seen her mishap. Frank jumped off the store platform and rushed to help her. Tilda was spitting dust and wheat. They were in her mouth and ears and hair, and inside her homespun waist. Her angry tears made mud smears on her cheeks. Since evidently only her feelings were hurt, the picture was too much for Frank and the other onlookers. They all laughed. Tilda stopped crying and glared around. \"There's nothing funny, about it! That was nice, clean wheat. Now look at it!\" Frank helped her to her feet and broke off his laugh. \"No, it wasn't funny, Sister Tilda.\" With a white handkerchief he awkwardly tried to brush the dust from her face. \"Thanks,\" she said in her stiffest tone. She jerked away. Some grains under her clothes were scratching her. She couldn't get them out with men around. \"Mr. Horrocks won't take dirty wheat.\" I?ll borrow a sieve from him,\" Frank offered. \"The dust'll blow off. I'll get a new sack.\" He leaped to the platform. Frank Robinson was kind, but he had laughed at her. And again he had seen her looking like all-get-out. So far as he was concerned it was no use to try to make herself appear pretty with a new dress. He'd never forget the sight she had been in Burnett's field, and now here sprawled on the street with her skirts over her head. Served her right for being so vain. Still, she had set out to get that calico, and she would?not to attract Frank, but to keep from being like ma. He came back with a shovel and sieve and a sack. The other men drifted down the street. Tilda and Frank didn't talk while they sieved her wheat and filled the new sack. The breeze blew away the dust. Frank carried the sack into the store. \"Mr. Horrocks,\" he announced, \"here is Mathilda Dawson with some wheat.\" The storekeeper peered over his spectacles at Tilda. \"I don't want wheat unless it's prime good. No smut.\" \"I gleaned it from Brother Burnett's field,\" she said quickly. \"Well, I'll take a look.\" Mr. Horrocks ran the full length of his arm into the sack and pulled up a fistful of kernels. He examined them critically while her heart filled her mouth. \"Yes, it's good wheat. Frank, take it back to the bin.\" Tilda breathed again. \"How much will you give me?\" \"I'm payin' three dollars a bushel to-day.\" \"Why!\" she exploded. \"Bishop Robinson offered me three. Reckon he'd have taken it to Salt Lake and sold it there for ten dollars.\" Horrocks looked at her shrewdly. \"Can't compete with Salt Lake prices. I admit it's good wheat, but five is the best I'll do.\" \"All right!\" she accepted. \"I mean five dollars in trade,\" the storekeeper amended. \"All right,\" Tilda repeated. \"And cash money if there's change.\" \"Yes. What do you want. Sister Tilda?\" \"Calico for a dress. Green. Maybe white vines or leaves in it.\" \"I've got some nice green. Only six bits a yard.\" The merchant selected a bolt of cloth. The lovely pattern and colors thrilled Tilda. This was worth all her hard work. She fingered the calico and her eyes lifted ecstatically. Then the joy in them died. On the shelf above Mr. Horrock's head stood a silver caster set. Exactly like ma's picture! Tilda couldn't speak. She just stared and pointed. \"That?\" The storekeeper reached TEN MILES TO CALICO 291 up for the caster. He set it before the girl. \"Pretty, ain't it? Took that in trade for some grub. Feller toted it all the way from back East.' 'H?How much d'you want for it?\" she forced herself to ask. Again Horrocks peered at her shrewdly. \"Well, that's real silver and worth more, but you can have it for five dollars. I don't have much call for such knickknacks.\" Tilda looked from the silver table-piece to the calico. She must not get like her mother. But if ma had this real caster set! Would it make her feel not so old? \"Got something to wrap it in so I won't scratch it carrying it home?\" The words were dead sounds that made hollow echoes of the longings she had killed. \"Here's the flannel the set was wrapped in,\" said the merchant. Frank Robinson returned from the rear of the store. \"She had 'most half a peck over a bushel, Mr. Horrocks.\" \"You have six bits change coming. Sister Tilda,\" the storekeeper calculated. \"I'll go get it from the money drawer.\" Slumped in misery, she gazed wistfully at the calico. Frank picked up the bolt. He flipped it round and round to show a length of the goods, then draped the cloth over her shoulder and smoothed it down to hang straight. It covered most of the front of her ugly dress. His rough fingers caught on her braids. \"With your yellow hair?,\" he paused, looking into her eyes. \"The green makes you like?like a daffy-dil. Like Spring.\" Numbly Tilda stared down at herself. At Frank's hand on her shoulder. At Frank. It was like a husband helping put a dress on his wife. His face turned brick red. He licked his lips. \"I was terrible forward.\" His words stumbled. \"I meant you'll be so beautiful in it.\" He wheeled and hurried out of the store. Tilda knew then the uttermost depths of wretchedness. Frank would never see her look like Spring. She'd always be in the dead blacks and rusty browns of a winter tree. Completely lifeless looking. For only a moment she had been transformed to beauty in his sight. Now she was ugly again. Mr. Horrocks brought her change. Her fingers closed listlessly over the two silver coins. She watched him wrap up the caster. She took the bundle in her arms. \"I could use more fine wheat like you brought,\" he remarked. Tilda burst through her numbness as if she had snapped rope bonds. Why, she hadn't half gleaned Brother Burnett's field! She could get another bushel of wheat as easily as the first! \"Here!\" Tilda thrust the coins into the storekeeper's hand. \"I'll be back with just as good a sackful. Take this money as part payment for six yards of that calico. The green! Be sure to save it for me. Promise!\" she demanded. He chuckled, \"It's a bargain. Sister Tilda.\" \"T'll bring the wheat in two weeks,\" she said. Tilda wanted to dance on the road home, but she had to be careful of the caster set. How ma's eyes would pop! Pa's, too. Tilda did a few cautious hop-skips, and sang, (Concluded on page 319) The Magazine Honor Roll for 1944 Vera W. Pohlman, Former General Secretary-Treasurer. THE momentum of the 1943 Magazine subscription campaign, when 13,000 new subscriptions were added, carried over into 1944, resulting in a further increase of more than 4,300 additional subscriptions. By the end of the year the subscription list had reached a new high figure of 71,200, an increase over the 66,790 subscriptions reported at the end of 1943 of 4,210 or six per cent.\nMore Than 1000 Names On Honor Roll\nThis year we are not reproducing the pictograph which for the two previous years were published (August 1943 and June 1944) to portray for each stake and mission the rate of Magazine subscriptions in relation to Relief Society members. As usual, however, we are recognizing in the accompanying honor roll all stakes, missions, wards, and branches, whose subscription rates in relation to number of Relief Society members equal or exceed 75 per cent. The 1944 honor roll contains more names than ever before?1020, an increase of 22 per cent over the 847 in 1943 and of 159 per cent over the 293 in 1942. Here are the comparative figures for 1943 and 1944:\n1943 1944 Increase No. Per cent\nLocal Relief Societies 776, 919, 143, 18. In Stakes 595, 674, 79, 13. In Missions 181, 245, 64, 35. Supervisory Organizations 71, 101, 30, 42. Stakes 57, 71, 14, 25. Missions 3, 6, 3, 50. Mission Districts 11, 24, 13, 118. Total on Honor Roll 847, 1020, 173, 20.\nThe honor roll is arranged in alphabetical order and the name of the Magazine representative appears opposite the name and record of each Relief Society listed. In those instances where no one is appointed as Magazine representative, the name of the president appears. Great credit is due the supervisory stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives, and all of the ward and branch Magazine representatives who have done the the ward and branch Magazine work of procuring subscriptions with the assistance and support of Relief Society officers and members. Page 292 THE MAGAZINE HONOR ROLL FOR 1944 293 We express the appreciation of the General Board to these faithful Magazine representatives and to all who assisted them. As an expression of its appreciation, the General Board is again awarding a free, one-year Magazine subscription to all local representatives who procured subscriptions equal to 75 per cent of the ward or branch Relief Society enrollment as of the end of 1944, and to all stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives appearing on the honor roll. The Magazine honor roll is based on subscription reports submitted to the General Board. However, Lethbridge and Oahu Stakes, and the British, East Central (except North Carolina District which submitted a report), Hawaiian, South African, and Texas Missions (of the English-speaking missions) failed to submit subscription reports for 1944. Also, a few districts of some of the reporting missions failed to respond?3 in the California Mission, 3 in the Northern States, 1 in Northwestern States, and 1 in the Southern States. Reference to the annual Relief Society reports compiled by the secretaries indicated that some of these unreported stakes and missions had local Relief Societies with rates entitling them to a position on the honor roll and they were, therefore, included. However, none is included from the British Mission from which neither report had been received by press time. 100 Percenters We especially congratulate the following 12 stakes, 1 mission, and 6 mission districts with Magazine subscription rates of 100 per cent or more, 12 of them appearing for the first time in this highest-ranking group: North and South Illinois District 102 San Francisco Stake 101 Uintah Stake 101 An amazing number of local Relief Societies achieved rates of 100 per cent or more?432 or 47 per cent of the 919 on the honor roll. These 100 percenters constituted 45 per cent or 304 of the 674 award-winning wards in stakes, and 32 per cent or 128 of the 245 award-winning mission branches. Some mission and stake Relief Societies have had unusual opportunity to place the Magazine in the homes of investigators and other non-members, and this yearns report shows that many have been diligent in this respect, as well as in placing the Magazine in the homes of Church members. Space limitations preclude special mention here of any but those with rates of 150 per cent or more, but all can easily be noted by reference to the honor roll. The 24 local Societies with exceptionally high rates are: Achievements oi Stakes Of the 57 stakes on the 1943 honor roll, all but 6 maintained this position. The loss of these 6 stakes (Lakeview, Mt. Graham, New York, South Sanpete, Star Valley, and Yellowstone) was more than off-set by 20 additional stakes which achieved honor-roll ratings. We extend congratulations to the 51 stakes which maintained their 1943 status and to the following 20 newly added stakes: Ben Lomond, Blackfoot, Bonneville, Chicago, Cottonwood, Denver, Emery, Liberty, Nampa, Oakland, Ogden, Park, St. Joseph, Salt Lake, San Bernardino, San Juan, Southern Arizona, Sugar House, Uintah, and Uvada Stakes. Many of these stakes nearly made the honor roll last year but in striving for honor roll position this year, several recorded considerable gains during 1944; for example, Uintah Stake which boosted its 1943 rate of 69 per cent to 101 per cent; Park Stake which rose from 74 to 103 per cent; Salt Lake from 65 to 88 per cent; Oakland from 66 to 86 per cent; Emery from 61 to 80 per cent; Sugar House from 56 to 75 per cent; Southern Arizona and San Bernardino both of which advanced from 71 to 89 per cent. Cottonwood Stake, also in this list, is mentioned in the \"Notes From the Field\" in this issue as having risen from a 1942 rate of 26 per cent?one of the lowest in the Church?to 90 per cent in 1944, a noteworthy accomplishment in a short period of time. Achievements of Missions All three of the missions which appeared on the 1943 honor roll-Australia, Western Canadian, and Western States?maintained their positions in 1944. The Australian Mission still leads the stakes and missions of the Church with a 1944 rate of 136 per cent. Three additional missions achieved the 1944 honor roll, not barely but with good rates?South African, 92 per cent; THE MAGAZINE HONOR ROLL FOR 1944 295 Southern States, 88 per cent; Northern States, 82 per cent. The number of mission districts (comparable in function to stakes) appearing on the honor roll increased from 11 in 1943 to 24 in 1944. Four of these 11 districts (Bakersfield in the California Mission, North Indiana and North Michigan in the Northern States Mission, and Great Falls in the Northwestern States Mission) failed to maintain their honor-roll rating. The other 7 districts which maintained their honor-roll status are: South Coast in California Mission; Central Ohio, North and South Illinois, South Ohio, and Wisconsin, in Northern States Missions; and Central Florida and South Georgia in the Southern States Mission. The 17 mission districts appearing on the honor roll for the first time this year are: Santa Barbara, San Gorganio, and Mojave of the California Mission; Central Indiana, East Michigan and West Michigan of the Northern States Mission; Northern Montana of Northwestern States Mission; Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, South Florida, South Georgia, West Florida, and West South Carolina of the Southern States Mission, and South Louisiana of the Texas Mission. Subscriptions From Non-ranking Societies Also Appreciated In addition to the stakes, missions, and mission districts whose local Relief Societies attained rates sufficient to place the entire area on the honor roll, 63 stakes and 10 missions are represented not by a rating for the stake or mission as a whole, but by one or more of their local Relief Societies which attained honor-roll status. Accordingly, a total of 134 stakes (all but 14) and of 16 English-speaking missions (all but 2) are represented on the 1944 honor roll by one or more local Societies. It is regretted that a few (Beaver, Panguitch, South Ogden, and Moon Lake Stakes, and the Hawaiian Mission) which were so represented in 1943 by high-ranking local Societies are not represented by even one ward or branch this year. Nevertheless, we are mindful and appreciative of the thousands of subscriptions which have helped to swell the total subscription list but which were obtained by local Relief Societies whose individual rates did not entitle them to a place on the honor roll. It is hoped that the accomplishments of the year 1944 will encourage these Relief Societies to renew their efforts during 1945 and match the achievements of their sister Societies. \n296\nHONOR ROLL\nRelief Society, Magazine Representative, Subscription Percent, Relief Society Members, Relief Society Secretary\nAlberta Stake Second, Clayton Stake Second, 85, 411, 117.

            "content": "Amy Brown Lyman MARIANNE C. SHARP IT was while attending a Relief Society convention in New York City more than a decade ago, that I first learned of the excellent service being rendered the organization by Marianne Clark Sharp, the newly appointed first counselor in the general presidency of the Relief Society, who then resided there. She was pointed out as one of the ablest and most faithful workers in that locality and, best of all, one who was willing and happy to work wherever she was most needed. It mattered not to her whether it was as class leader, visiting teacher, officer, or lay member, her interest and enthusiasm in the work she had to do was always of the highest quality. Page 262 She served while in New York as literature and theology class leader, president of Queen's Branch Society, stake board member, and finally as stake counselor to Mrs. Lorena Fletcher. Mrs. Howard R. Driggs, also of New York, remarked at that time that Marianne would make a very excellent General Board member, and she expressed the hope that some day she would see her working in this capacity. It was only natural, after her return to Utah, that Sister Sharp should continue her work in the Relief Society cause. Her devotion and efficiency were soon recognized in both ward and stake where her work as a class leader became so outstanding that no one who knew her or her accomplishments was surprised at the call that came to her, in January 1940, to serve as a member of the General Board. And now at this time, her appointment, on April 6, 1945, as first counselor in the general presidency of the organization is heartily approved by Relief Society women generally, and especially by her fellow Board members who know her best and appreciate her most. Blessed with a noble heritage, a rich background, rare native endowments, broad education and training, and with unwavering faith in the gospel of the Master, Sister Sharp is especially well fitted for this place of honor and trust. She is also blessed with the support of a devoted and understanding husband, a Christian gentleman of the highest order, and a faithful Latterday Saint. Ivor Sharp to whom she was married in 1927 is the present manager of KSL. He came to this position from the Long Lines Department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in New York City. He is known in the business world as a man of fine character, outstanding ability and distinction, and is loved, honored, and respected by his associates in business as well as by his fellow workers in the Church. There are three lovely and interesting children in the Sharp home Luceine (Sally) Louise, and Annetta. To these children the parents are devoted.\nSister Sharp is the daughter of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., first counselor in the First Presidency of the Church, and the late Luceine Savage Clark. Theirs was a home where the standards of the Church were always strictly observed, and where the children were taught faith in God and in the latter-day work, that the greatest joy and satisfaction came to those who adhere to the religious life. Sister Luceine Savage Clark also loved and was devoted to Relief Society and its ideals, and worked in the organization all of her mature life. Her heart is no doubt made glad with joy and pride to have this greatly deserved honor come to her sweet and lovely daughter Marianne.\nDURING her five years service on the General Board, Sister Sharp has visited conferences and conventions and she has served on a number of important committees. Her major task, however, has been in the editorial field. With her discriminating judgment, quickness of perception, clarity of mind, and her capacity for work, and with the diligence and dispatch with which she works, she has given invaluable service as an editor. She assisted our new General President Belle S. Spafford in compiling, preparing, and editing A Centenary of Relief Society, published by the General Board during our centennial year, 1942. For a period she was assistant to Sister Spafford, the editor of Theand, in 1943, was named associate editor in which capacity she has served since that time. The many positions which Marianne has held have all come to her unsought. She has accepted these calls because she is obedient and because of her sense of service and her ardent desire to do something helpful for her Church and for her community.\nSister Sharp received her education in the grade and high schools of Washington, D. C. and at the University of Utah. From the latter institution she was graduated, in 1934, with high honors. She was awarded a teaching fellowship in Latin during her senior year and she continued teaching that subject at the University after her graduation.\nSister Sharp has rare gifts of spirit, mind and heart, with a deep humility. She is frank and honest, tender and sympathetic. She is generous and appreciative of the work and ability of others. While she has clear-cut, positive views, she is always open minded and teachable, always ready to listen to the views of others. But with her right and principle must come first. Above all she is loyal to those in her position of authority over her and gives them full support. She has great reverence for and is always obedient to the Priesthood. With these fine characteristics and qualifications her future is sure to be one of achievement."

In 1942, this stake's rate of Magazine subscriptions was among the lowest in the Church?26 per cent. Stake and ward Relief Society workers, determined to increase the rate, made the greatest numerical increase in the Church during 1943 (from 211 to 580 subscriptions) but, nevertheless, fell slightly short of the honor roll with 71 per cent of their members as subscribers. They still persisted in their efforts, and now appear on the honor roll for 1944 with a stake rate of 90 per cent, and with 6 of 8 wards represented.\nMerle S. Muir, stake counselor in charge of the Magazine, wrote of this accomplishment:\n\"It is a satisfying climax to a huge effort and one of which we are very proud. This happens to be the first time in the history of our stake that we have been fortunate enough to achieve the honor roll. We hope it won't be the last. You will notice our subscription rate is 90 per cent for the stake and that 5 wards have over 100 per cent. All credit is due our ward Magazine representatives and officers for their effort and support. We found them willing and enthusiastic workers, and I'm sure the satisfaction they feel in their ward and stake report repays them for their efforts. As a stake we appreciate beyond words their efforts.\n\"Our biggest desire now is that each will read and enjoy her Magazine and realize the spiritual and temporal help it gives. As a stake we express our appreciation to the Magazine staff for the splendid Magazine they give us. We enjoy and appreciate the privilege of working in the Relief Society and the association it gives us.\"\nZion Park Stake\nJESSIE H. GIBSON, stake Magazine representative, wrote last January commending the ward Magazine representatives and officers for their efforts which placed this stake on the 1944 honor roll with a rate of 91 per cent. Five of the 7 wards of this stake also appear on the honor roll with high rates.\nHer letter continues: \"We feel especially proud of the record of Della Hardy, Magazine representative of Springdale Ward, who has placed the Magazine in every home in her community whether members of our Church or not. Several Magazines were also sent to other communities as Christmas presents. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 315 She exceeded her good 1943 rate of 86 per cent by the exceptional rate of 154 per cent for 1944. We feel that her leadership deserves a little special mention and hope it will inspire other Magazine representatives to try a little harder next year.\" Boise Stake CAROL R. FLAKE, president of * the Boise Fourth Ward Relief Society, wrote last August: \"At the suggestion of Dorothy Clapp Robinson, counselor in the Boise Stake Relief Society and supervisor of the Magazine representatives, I am sending in this account of our 'Dollar Day' which launched our Magazine campaign. Lillis Me-lander is our representative. \"A large group of our sisters met in the pleasant surroundings of Elm Grove Park where a program was presented featuring the importance of the Magazine to the entire family. Talks on the subject. Things I Like About the Magazine' gave interesting and varied reasons for having it in the home. Our stake Relief Society president, Josephine Anderson, and Counselor Dorothy Clapp Robinson, commended us for our achievement of 104 per cent in the 1943 campaign and urged us to include at least 6 subscriptions this year to be sent to our Church missionaries. Accordingly, our members deposited voluntary contributions in an attractive dish which was afterwards awarded as prize to the one guessing nearest to the correct total of $8.14 which was received. \"The program was interspersed with the singing of several original Magazine pep songs composed by various members, including the following: HERE IS OUR MAGAZINE Irene Read Tune \"Idaho\" (State song) You've heard of the wonders of our Magazine And all of the good it can do. It educates, stimulates, brings out the best But not half has been told to you. Chorus So here is our Magazine, Winning its way to the top. Once you've subscribed it will always come, You never will let it stop. You will read it, morn, noon, and night. Keep it in sight?'twill make your life bright. You will love it, its praises you'll sing, Sing of our Magazine. Our agent will take your subscription today. And benefits soon you will glean. When your family looks forward each month for the day When the postman brings their Magazine/ I'LL SUBSCRIBE FOR ANOTHER YEAR Edith Mathews Tune \"Auld Lang Syne\" Is my subscription up to date? I surely want to know. I cannot miss a single book Because I need it so. Our Magazine, our Magazine, Its pages I hold dear, I need its influence in our home? I'll subscribe for another year!\" As indicated by the foregoing report, the Boise Stake Relief Society officers suggested that each ward contribute 6 gift subscriptions for women in foreign missions, and some of the wards exceeded this assignment. The stake board itself set the example, sending in seven gift subscriptions, one in the name of each ward of the stake. This is another stake which exceeded its good 1943 rate of 80 per cent by a 1944 rate of 95 per cent for the stake as a whole. Five of the 7 wards appear on the honor roll, all of them with rates well above those of last year, four of them over 100 per cent. Western States Mission LUCEAL R. CURTIS, recently released Relief Society president of this mission, wrote in September 1944: \"Since March 17 our mission has had as one of its projects the binding ofs. One Relief Society now has a complete set of the Magazines bound and in its library. Two other Societies have 7 bound volumes and a great number have 3. These Magazines were bound to celebrate my three years in the mission. When they had them bound they sent, on July 15, a birthday card stating that they now had in their libraries bound volumes of the Magazine for 1941-42-43.\" For the third successive year this mission has achieved a place on the honor roll, this year with a higher rate of 81 per cent, and with nineteen of thirty-five branches represented, thirteen of them with rates of 100 per cent or over, including Sheridan Branch with the exceptional rate of 157 per cent.OPENS THE DOOR SPIRITUAL LITERACY SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE Magazine Campaign Poster, West Ensign Ward, Ensign Stake. Luendah E. Hagen was the Magazine representative of this ward. Ensign Stake LEONE H. ELIASON, stake Magazine representative of this stake which appears on the honor roll with a stake rate of 78 per cent and with four of six wards represented, suggested that each of the ward representatives make a poster for display in each Relief Society room. Each poster was to be original, to give some indication of the value derived from the lessons and other material published in the Magazine, to create interest in the Magazine among non-subscribers, and to serve as a constant reminder to subscribers to renew promptly. At a party held at the close of the campaign month, October in this stake, each ward representative was asked to bring her poster, and the display created much interest. The NOTES FROM THE FIELD 317 poster of the West Ensign Ward, conceded to be the best, is here reproduced. It aided the ward Magazine representative, Luendah E. Hagen, to reach the rate of 82 per cent with which this ward appears on the honor roll. A close second in popularity was the colorful poster of the South Twentieth Ward, depicting a cottage framed in trees, with a spacious lawn in front allowing for well-placed flower beds and borders. As subscriptions were received, the garden bloomed with tiny, bright-colored straw flowers, artistically glued in place. The energetic subscription gardener, Leone Seiter, appears on the honor roll with 131 subscriptions to her credit and a rate of 102 per cent. A feature of the party for ward representatives was the surprise demonstration of selling the Magazine which was given by Hazel Spencer of the North Eighteenth Ward (on the honor roll with 140 subscriptions, 79 per cent), with stake Relief Society president, Alice B. Steinicke, as the potential subscriber. Sister Eliason concludes that some of the qualifications of a successful Magazine representative are enthusiasm, willingness to serve, cheerfulness, and familiarity with Magazine content in order to be able to acquaint others with its value. MAGAZINE GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS In 1944, as in previous years, many gift subscriptions were received at the Magazine office from individuals and from ward and stake Relief Societies for distribution at the discretion of the Magazine office. These gift subscriptions are received with great appreciation by those to whom they are sent, principally missionaries and officers of new mission branch Relief Societies who may not have been able to subscribe immediately themselves. During 1944, these generous and thoughtful gifts aggregated $100 and came from all the wards of Boise Stake, Shelley First and Fifth Wards of the Shelley Stake, Worland and Byron Wards of Big Horn Stake, Tremon-ton Ward of Bear River Stake, Farmington Ward of South Davis Stake, and from Mt. Jordan stake board and the following wards of Mt. Jordan Stake?Crescent, Draper First and Second, Sandy Second and Third. COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE REPRESENTATIVES I regret very much to inform you this will be my last year as Magazine representative in Twin Groves Ward, Yellowstone Stake, as we have left the ward and moved into town. I never have done anything in the Church I have loved and enjoyed more, and my prayers and wishes will always be that Twin Groves will never fail to subscribe 100 per cent for this wonderful Magazine. We have 32 members enrolled in our ward... With 42 subscriptions or 131 per cent, the largest I have ever obtained and it really gives me a great thrill?Pearl Rigby, St. Anthony, Idaho. By the end of the year the rate for this ward was 145 per cent. I did my best to keep my promise to you. The sisters were very good to cooperate with me. I worked on the husbands, daughters, and sons the week before Mother's Day which helped a lot. Their faces would light up as if a great load had been lifted when I suggested the Magazine as a gift to mother. They would take the receipt and enclose it with their Mother's Day card.

COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE WRITERS I can't remember whether or not I wrote you concerning the contest poems and stories this year. I thought the poems were exceptionally good. Mrs. Crawford's so helpful, timely, and with her usual lovely spirit showing through; Mrs. Coles with her high grade poetry and high emotional quality; and Mrs. Miner with her abundant faith Ogden, Utah. I am always very proud to publish in TheSalt Lake City. You present the material so attractively it's always a great satisfaction to me to have a poem published in your Magazine. ?Silverdale, Washington. For some time now I have been wanting to write to you about the Magazine. There have been so many things lately that I have enjoyed.... I liked the story \"Mama's Boy.\" It carries such a wonderful message without seeming to preach, besides it is well written. I think we all enjoy our preaching better when it is hidden rather than held up to view?in stories I mean. I always enjoy those child stories of Olive Woolley Burt's.... The series of articles about painters by Mrs. Home have been especially pleasing to me. I had no idea we (the Church) had so many women who have distinguished themselves in that line. I liked the story of the Big Horn Basin, too.... The poets in this part of Idaho appreciate the market you give them. With all good wishes for your continued success.?Boise, Idaho. Ten Miles to Calico (Concluded from page 291) ?Five miles to calico! Five miles to calico!\" Then she laughed. ?Ten miles to calico! Ten miles to calico!\" What did it matter that she'd have to go to town twice for it? Her calico was in the store, waiting. She was going to look beautiful, like a daffodil! For Frank! Now she would walk home as fast as she could until the last mile. Then she'd run. So ma could have her caster set in the middle of the table while they ate supper. (The End) MORNING Susa Gould Walker A quivering stillness? The warbling of a wren; The fresh, sweet scent of dew-drenched lilac blooms. A smile, and two blue eyes Above a crib, and then My life made sweet, as sunshine floods the rooms. All-Year Care of the Rose Beds (Concluded from page 286) protection is seldom needed for roses in the Salt Lake valley, but in colder localities the plants must be protected.\nThe best protection is a mound of earth applied over each plant after freezing weather has arrived. This should be kept at hand ready to apply, manure can then be used to fill in the space between, but should not be applied directly over the plant during winter months. In very cold sections where the temperatures stay below zero for long periods, it is well to use additional protection of branches of trees, shrubs, corn stalks or other loose material on top of the mound of earth and manure.\nAnd so we come to the end of the story. Does this sound so very formidable? When once these simple tasks are learned, they become a pleasure, for their rewards are so great. Can one measure such small undertakings against the privilege of plucking flowers of such perfection and beauty as the rose! Can one coldly calculate a few hours of effort scattered over the year when they bring us roses to cheer and comfort, to speak their message of beauty and love!"

            "content": "Belle Smith Spafford Called to Be Ninth General President of Relief Society, April 1945 Marianne C. Sharp First Counselor in General Presidency \"O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day\" (Doc. And Gov. 4:2). THE admonition of the Lord contained in the above verse of the Doctrine and Covenants, a favorite quotation of Belle Smith Spafford, has been heeded by her throughout life. This observance coupled with the manner in which she has developed her great capabilities in working for the Relief Society resulted in the call by the First Presidency, on April 6, 1945, of Sister Spafford to become the ninth general president of Relief Society.\nPresident Spafford will be welcomed to her new position by a host of friends, members of the Relief Society throughout the United States and in the stakes of Canada and Mexico, whom she has met during the past ten years while she has traveled extensively in the interest of the Society. They will recall her affectionately for her friendly interest in regard to their special problems, and the ability which she has demonstrated in helping to solve them.\nIt was just ten years ago this April 1945 that Sister Spafford was called by President Louise Y. Robison from her position as counselor to President Marie Tanner of the Wells Stake Relief Society to become a member of the General Board. In December of 1937, she was asked to assume the added responsibility of being editor of Thefollowing the death of Sister Mary C. Kimball. During the eight years that Sister Spafford has edited the Magazine it has had a phenomenal growth in subscriptions   increasing from 40,000 in 1937 to 72,000 as of April 1945. The excellence of the contents has been of a high order which has steadily improved over the years, reflecting the advancement of the women of the Church in writing skills. It was in 1942 that a short-story contest was inaugurated by the General Board which has resulted in encouraging Church women to enter the field of fiction and improved the content of the Magazine in that line. As editor she has consistently manifested a great desire to meet first, the spiritual, and then the literary reading needs of the readers of the Magazine. When Sister Lyman was called to become general president, in 1940, she retained Sister Spafford as editor, and gave to her the added responsibility of serving as an editor of A Centenary of Relief Society published to commemorate the first hundred years of the Society. The knowledge gained from this experience has given to Sister Spafford a broad understanding of the rise and development of the Society which will prove invaluable to her in her new position.\nIn addition to editorial duties, President Spafford has always carried her full share of General Board responsibilities, and has done preeminent work as the chairman of important committees. Her ability in this line was signally recognized in November 1942 when she was called by President Lyman to succeed Sister Donna D. Sorensen as her second counselor in charge of educational work. The faithful performance by President Spafford of every call which has been made upon her for Church service whether to serve in the Sunday School, the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association or the Relief Society, to which so many years of her life have been devoted, has culminated in the present call to head the great Relief Society.\nBELLE SMITH SPAFFORD was born of goodly parents. She has never known the loving, watchful care of a father for her own father, John Gibson Smith, who was born in Toode, died when he was only forty years old and before Belle Smith Spafford was born. Her young mother was thus left to face life alone and to rear her six children and an orphaned son of a brother. The family resided in Salt Lake City. Sister Smith was a true Latter-day Saint, and her wise sayings are often quoted by her descendants and continue to guide them in their daily conduct.\nSister Spafford received her schooling in the Salt Lake City schools, at the L.D.S. high school and is a graduate of the University of Utah Normal School. The teaching skill which she gained in the years she spent teaching in the Salt Lake City schools and at the Training School at the Brigham Young University has been reflected in the professional supervision which she has given to the better teaching of the lessons taught in Relief Society. She pays high tribute to the influence on her life of that great personality President George H. Brimhall who imbued her with the importance of religious and spiritual values in education, and of that outstanding educator, President Franklin S. Harris, for helping her to appreciate the values of high educational standards and the necessity of continuous application in improving one's teaching skills.\nPresident Spafford is the wife of Willis Earl Spafford who is Field Deputy of Internal Revenue. Without his tender care which he always has guarded her, without his unselfish acceptance of the calls which have been made upon her time, increasing with the passing of the years, without his full support and wholehearted co-operation, it would not have been possible for Sister Spafford to have continued her Church duties and at the same time to have cared for her family of two children. Their daughter Mary at the present time is doing postgraduate work in social work at the University of Utah, and their son, Earl Smith Spafford, is in the navy serving as a hospital apprentice at Portsmouth, Virginia.\nIn leading forward this greatest of all women's organization, President Belle Spafford's great concern, as has also been that of her predecessors in this office, will be to follow out, implicitly, the desires of the Priesthood in regard to Relief Society, and to so plan and so shape its activities as to fully support the great Church Welfare Plan, and to foster and strengthen in Relief Society members a living testimony of the gospel.\nIt will be a joy to me to work under the guidance of Sister Spafford in the general presidency of Relief Society. She is a thorough Latterday Saint and is guided in her decisions by the standards of the gospel. She is a considerate and fair fellow worker, always ready to undertake the major part of any assignment and to help out in any need, at the same time, however, expecting a high standard of performance in return. She is a tireless and prodigious worker. For the past eight years she has spent many hours of each working day on some phase of Relief Society activity, and her assignments have been many and varied. The great honor which has come to President Spafford may be considered as a merited blessing on her years of self-sacrificing and devoted service.\nRELIEF SOCIETY Amy Jeanne Donnei One hundred years have vanished down the skies As apple blossoms disappear with spring, And still the work goes on! Strong, lingering, A Prophet's inspiration and command Still guide us, with a love that never dies. Throughout the years a valiant, growing band Of mothers, loyal, humble, kind and true. Has sought and helped the needy, lit anew The flame of hope in many a careworn heart, Soothed many a fevered brow with gentle hand, And strong and steadfast, gladly borne its part In trouble, and when famine swept the land. Dear Father, by whose blessings all these years Thy daughters have grown numerous and strong. Facing the coming years with quiet eyes, Humbly we pray for wisdom to do right. And courage that strides onward though through tears. And deep humility and faith in thee. That we may do thy will, and with the light Of truth and kindness and the Spirit's fire Hold high the standard that the Prophet gave With God's command and covenant unto Those mothers that he blessed so long ago. If we can be as gentle and as kind. As valiant, righteous, generous, and true As those first mothers, then our hearts' desire Thou wilt have granted, for we ask of thee But to be worthy of the name they bore. And of thy blessings on us, as of yore."

            "content": "Gertrude Ryberg Garff Second Counselor in General Presidency, April 1945 Edith Smith Elliott THE wise selection of Gertrude Ryberg Garff as second counselor to President Belle Smith Spafford of the Latter-day Saint Relief Society will be a blessing to the women of the Church. Her training and background fit her admirably for her new position. Above all else, she has a firm testimony of the gospel of Jesus Ghrist, and although young in years, she is old in experience. Sister Garff was born in Hyrum, Utah, to Charlotte Critchlow and Eric William Ryberg. Both the Critchlows and the Rybergs contribute a rich heritage to Gertrude. Her mother's forbears rank high in early educational fields and were participants in the American Revolution. Sister Ryberg has been a leader, active in Relief Society. Gertrude's father's parents were converts to the Church from Sweden. They settled in Logan, Utah, and played a forceful part in the development of that community. Brother Ryberg has been a successful contractor and is an outstanding executive in the business world. Sister Garff was five years old when the family moved to Salt Lake City in Wasatch Ward. She is fortunate to have had parents who trained her in the paths of knowledge and righteousness. She has always had great faith in her Heavenly Father, which has been a great source of comfort to her. She has been a firm believer in the fact that GERTRUDE R. GARFF *'faith without works is dead,\" so she has willingly done her part.   She completed her early studies in the Salt Lake City schools. Desiring further knowledge and training, she entered the University of Utah. At the end of her second year she received and honored a call to fill a mission for her Church. She was assigned to the Eastern States Mission under the presidency of Brother James H. Moyle. Here she labored as a field missionary in Jamestown, New York, and in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Her special assignment was radio work. Her mission strengthened her testimony in the divinity of Christ and gave her a religious schooling that has helped pattern her life.\nHer mission furthered her desire for learning. She knew that the \"glory of God is intelligence,\" so when she returned home she once more entered the University and graduated in 1935 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Her major was in textiles, with a minor in foods and child welfare.\nIN October 1935, she married Mark Brimhall Garff, son of Tryphena Brimhall (sister of President George Brimhall) and George P. Garff. She had met her future husband (who had been home two years from a Danish mission) at a Granite Stake conference where they had both been called upon to discuss their missionary experiences.\nIn September 1937, Brother and Sister Garff were again called to the Lord's service this time to preside over the Danish Mission with headquarters in Copenhagen. Their son Mark was only two and one-half months old so this made the planning for so long a journey a major problem. However, with faith in God they lost no time settling to the task before them. Both were very young to be given so important an assignment but, in spite of this, they made an enviable record. Sister Garff learned the language so that she could assume her full responsibilities as head of the women's auxiliaries, with a special and personal interest in Relief Society. She won the love and trust of the Danish saints. Her warmth and understanding made her role as \"mission mother\" a source of strength to the\nin the welfare of young people was ever apparent not has it even ceased since she returned to Zion.\nBesides discharging her many missionary duties admirably, Gertrude found time to study the social, historical, economic, and cultural aspects of the Danes. She learned to love and appreciate these Norsemen. A lover of art, crafts, literature, and music, she spent any free time she had in museums, art galleries, and opera houses.\nShe enjoyed the companionship of her baby. She used to take him with her on bicycle rides in and around Copenhagen tucked into the baby's seat on the front of her bicycle.\nWhen the war clouds gathered and broke into World War II, our missionaries were called home. The first available space that President Garff could obtain to transport his wife, little son, and several Scandinavian missionaries to home shores was on a tramp steamer. President Garff had to remain to reorganize the mission on a local basis. We can well imagine the anxiety of that parting. Faith alone made it possible. The ship had to take a northern route up around Iceland for safety. The voyage lasted seventeen days and the passage was unusually rough. Gertrude and the baby arrived home in November, in time to spend thanksgiving with her father and mother. By Christmas, President Garff returned safely and the little family was grateful to be reunited.\nThe following January 1940, Sister Garff was appointed a member of the General Board of Relief Society under its new president, Amy Brown Lyman. Sister Garff and Sister Lyman had developed a close friendship in Europe which Sister Lyman was presiding over the women's auxiliaries of the European mission. Sister Garff has said of her many occasions that she doesn't know how she could have carried on her great responsibilities had it not been for Sister Lyman's frequent letters of direction and encouragement. Sister Lyman's deep understanding of people and their problems, with her helpful disposition made it natural for Gertrude to turn to her for counsel and advice. She was very happy to be called into a continued association with so noble a character.\nSister Garff is friendly and approachable. She works well with people. She has the courage of her convictions, yet is pliable to the extent that if she is shown a better way she willingly accepts it. She attacks each assignment with an open-mindedness intelligence.\nGertrude and Mark have three young children: Mark R. (eight years), Charlotte (four years), and baby Georgia (one and one-half years). These human treasures along with her splendid husband receive her untiring devotion.\nFrom her husband, her father, and her mother, she will receive maximum support in her new position."

I troll the ageless certitudes again Down to you from a wind-washed eminence Where russet soil has settled on this tier Of rock. The evergreen still drives its lance Into the sky, a changeless cavalier. The butterflies thread woods along the stream. Woof of the forest and weft of your dream. Assurance of unaltered majesty In the long-lived profile of a precipice, I send, and faith no stricken earth nor tree Shall disillusion your returning eyes.... Upon the northern slope, the aspen stems Glow silver-green, pale as a luna moth; The fern is beaded lace between the hems And petticoats of cool and living cloth. This boulder sheltered daisies small as these The age, when under Pinta's listing spars, Mutinous eyes, from strange and fearful seas, Were lifted to the same familiar stars.

            "content": "Marcia Knowlton Howells First Counselor in the General Presidency, 1940-45 President Amy Brown Lyman MARCIA K. HOWELLS DAUGHTER of a Relief Society stake president and relative of one of the two elders who assisted the Prophet Joseph Smith at the organization meeting of the Relief Society, Marcia Knowlton Howells has, since her childhood days, been familiar with Relief Society work and activities, and she has always loved, appreciated, and honored this great woman's auxiliary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Her mother, Minerva Richards Knowlton, was a life-long member of the Society and served for many years with distinction as Relief Society Page 272 president of Davis Stake, which at that time covered the whole of Davis County. In addition to traveling about, supervising and directing the welfare, health, and civic activities in this progressive unit. Sister Knowlton planned and prepared the courses of study used in her wards. The General Board at that time did not provide, as it does today, a uniform course of study, and stakes were left to prepare their own work. Marcia, no doubt, remembers seeing her mother work long hours and far into the night over her outlines, after a hard day of household activities. Her grandfather's uncle. Dr. Willard Richards, accompanied Joseph Smith and John Taylor to that important meeting in Nauvoo, Illinois, on March 17, 1842, when the Relief Society was organized, and assisted by acting as temporary secretary until the organization was effected and Eliza R. Snow was appointed permanent secretary. His name is listed among the seven donors who, on that memorable occasion, made charity contributions and thus established the first charity fund of the Society. With this unusual Relief Society background, a rich heritage in itself for a Relief Society worker, with her long years of service in the organization, and with her exceptional ability, Sister Howells has been able to make outstanding contributions to MARCIA KNOWLTON HOWELLS 273 the Relief Society cause in both ward and stake as well as on the General Board. I first met Marcia Knowlton at the summer cottage of Sister Heber J. Grant at Brighton where we were both guests. I was immediately attracted to her because of her charming and interesting personality, her fine qualities of heart and mind, and her boundless energy and interest in life. And from that time on I have loved and admired her and have enjoyed association with her as a fellow worker in civic and Church activities. SISTER HOWELLS was called to the General Board of Relief Society on February 2, 1929, and on January 1, 1940 was appointed first counselor in the general presidency. As a Board member she has given generously of her time to important committee work, and has traveled extensively throughout the Church attending stake and mission conferences and conventions. Her work in the general presidency has been largely of an administrative nature. As manager of the temple and burial clothes department and general director of the Mormon Handicraft Shop, she has demonstrated unusual executive and managerial ability, carrying forward her labors in these connections with efficiency, diligence, and dispatch, and achieving, withal, phenomenal success. Directing the work of these two important departments, always a challenge, has been especially taxing the last few years because of the shortage of materials and merchandise and because of war restrictions; but Sister Howells has always regarded this assignment as a rare privilege which she has enjoyed. She appreciates the distinctive and important service and opportunity these projects provide or offer to the people of the Church. As a member of the general Church Welfare committee, with special assignment to the clothing committee, and as work director on the General Board, Sister Howells has given time and attention to the clothing and sewing plans of the Church Welfare program, and to the sewing activities which are carried on in the regular work meetings of the Society. She has also assisted with the preparation of that portion of the General Welfare budget which has to do with the clothing program. Sister Howells has represented the General Board in many community activities, notably those which have had to do with health and welfare work. She was state chairman of the May Day Child Health Day in 1939. She is at present a valued member of the executive committee of the board of directors of the Utah Tuberculosis Association. She recently helped to direct the establishment of the splendid library of which the U. S. O. Of Salt Lake City has been so proud. In 1939, she attended the National Conference of Social Workers at San Francisco, following which she attended a social service institute at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1941 in company with Sister Donna D. Sorensen, she represented the Society at the biennial meeting of the National Council of Women. Sister Howells has been a wise, safe, and helpful counselor. Blessed with intelligence, broad experience, and sound judgment, and fortified with a burning testimony of the gospel and with an understanding of the responsibilities and obligations resting upon those who serve in a Church capacity, she has been able to recognize the relative importance and value of the many questions and problems presented for consideration and action, and to help to make wise, reasonable, and safe decisions. She is an able presiding officer and a gifted and fluent public speaker, with an excellent vocabulary. She gave promise of these fine qualities of leadership when, as a young woman, she served as president of her class at the L.D.S. high school, and as vice-president of the student body of that institution; also later during her four-year period of teaching.\nShe was educated in the public schools of Farmington, at the L.D.S. high school and University of Utah, preparing herself for the teaching profession at the latter institution. In 1910, she was married to Dr. Thomas J. Howells, a leading physician of the State, and an able and progressive specialist in the field of public health. He was for many years the Salt Lake City health commissioner, in which position he gave excellent service, and is at present a member of the State Board of Health.\nSister Howells is a generous, devoted, and unselfish friend. She is never happier than when doing something for others. When her friends are in trouble she is among the first to visit and comfort them. I count it as one of the distinctive privileges of my life to associate with and share work with Marcia Knowlton Howells."

Thoroughly familiar with the history, rulings, and policies of the Society, acquainted with General Board office procedures, having a knowledge of the requirements of Reliei Society Magazine work, and intimate with the work of the Relief Society welfare department through twelve years of previous service in the general offices, her Relief Society background was rich. Prior to her appointment as general secretary-treasurer she had served with the Salt Lake County Department of Public Welfare, where she organized recording and filing systems and supervised the stenographic and clerical staff. She had also been employed as statistician with the State Emergency Relief Administration (F. E. R. A.) which was succeeded by the State Department of Public Welfare, where she served as director of its bureau of research and statistics, contributing much to the development and establishment of its policies and procedures, and to the training of personnel in this new function of state government in Utah. VERA W. POHLMAN All of this experience was invaluable in her Relief Society assignment which had so much to do with welfare work, important record keeping, the formulating and establishment of rulings, policies, and procedures, and the training of personnel. At the time of the appointment of Vera W. Pohlman as general secretary-treasurer, Mrs. Amy W. Evans wrote of her: \"With her natural ability for details, her experience in welfare work, her fund of information regarding and thorough understanding of all phases of Relief Society work, her faithfulness to trust, and her dependability, Mrs. Pohlman will make a very efficient and valuable general secretary.\" Page  This prognostication has indeed been fulfilled. Her record of efficient service to the Society in this responsible position will ever stand a credit to her and a blessing to the Relief Society. Vera W. Pohlman has a brilliant and an analytical mind. She has a marvelous capacity not only to quickly and clearly see a problem or a situation, but to see all that is in any way related to it; she readily recognizes the influence of one situation upon another and can accurately foresee results of action. This rare capacity has made her of inestimable value in executive councils, in committee work, and as a member of the General Board, enabling her to arrive at sound conclusions and to guide others to do likewise. Mrs. Pohlman is a tireless, enduring worker. No amount of time or effort is considered, nor is any thought of saving herself allowed to enter into the performance of her duties. During the early years of her incumbency as general secretary-treasurer when, in addition to the regular duties incident to this position, she was reorganizing the offices and setting up new and more economical and efficient systems of management, she also carried a tremendous responsibility and did a vast amount of work in connection with Relief Society centennial plans and activities. During this period she worked long into the night, denying herself recreation and relaxation. Every minute was devoted to duty. THERE are few people who take greater pride in their work than does Vera Pohlman. Careful, painstaking, accurate effort accompanies all that she does from the smallest unimportant bit of work to the heaviest and most essential of tasks. Perfection is her standard of measurement. Vera fully appreciates the importance of the Relief Society cause. She loves the women of the Church and has a sincere desire to serve them. She continuously strives to make things clear, easy, and convenient for them, and she is never happier than when she feels she has been of service. She has met with thousands of Relief Society women in her visits to the stakes and missions of the Church. In 1943 she traveled continuously from early September until mid-December, meeting with Relief Society women representing 142 stakes and missions. The many expressions of appreciation for these visits bear evidence of the regard felt for her by Relief Society women because of her efficiency and knowledge of Relief Society work, and of their love and admiration for her because of her willingness to serve them. Special mention should here be made of a few of Mrs. Pohlman's special contributions to Relief Society. She has prepared new, simplified visiting teacher report books, and has revised ward and stake record books. The revised record books allow for the inclusion of valuable information, much of which was formerly not included, particularly with regard to the sewing program. This information permits a clear picture of the status of all phases of Relief Society work and materially aids the General Board to better plan and more effectively direct the Society. Mrs. Pohlman's personal ability to interpret figures and give them life and vitality is a rare gift.\nIn 1941, she prepared family record forms for use of Relief Society presidents in making a family analysis. These forms, endorsed by the Church Welfare Plan, are in use at the present time and are a guide and an asset to Relief Society presidents in analyzing the situation of families under care and in making sound recommendations to bishops regarding family needs.\nRelief Society publications have benefited by the skills and knowledge of Vera W. Pohlman. She is a gifted writer, meticulous in the preparation of material for publication and is familiar with technical publishing details. She has continuously edited \""

No doubt many members of the Institute have wondered what vocation in life they should adopt by means of which they could earn their own livelihood, thus promoting self-reliance and the ability to do something sufficiently remunerative to enable them to fight the battle of life single-handed, if necessity required it, or circumstances compelled them to do so. As there is always a possibility that reverses may come to all of us is it not wisdom to give some consideration to this subject? It would be impossible to define just what course any member should follow to become entirely successful; in this matter, as in many others, we must be our own judges. One thing I can say with certainty, and that is this: In making up our minds we should not adopt any kind of labor in the slightest degree degrading. Whatever we try to do, let it be the labor we love; something we can do enthusiastically. People are rarely successful who work mechanically. Some persons have thought, and do so now, that the only labors a woman should perform must be of a domestic character; that to be a household drudge is all she is capable of being; but such persons must be told that at the present time there are hundreds of ladies in the civilized world making themselves famous as authors, physicians, surgeons, public speakers, painters, sculptors and lawyers. The advanced situation of the women of today grants to her all the privileges she may seek to enjoy; and if for any reason she does not choose to marry, there is no law to compel her to do so. This being the case she should know how to take care of herself, and earn her own living...  C. R. S.  A Pleasant Party. Editor Exponent: One of the most enjoyable affairs that ever happened in Deseret came off on the 2d of April in the form of a surprise party in honor of the Prest. Of our Society at the Relief Hall. Sister Eliza Whicker has been president of this society for seven years, and is a noble and well respected sister. The tables were spread with a sumptuous repast and the company seated when our beloved President arrived. After dinner the ceremonies were continued by presenting Sister Whicker with a neatly gotten up and appropriate address in a suitable frame, and several other presents by the sisters, followed by a programme, consisting of speeches, songs and recitations Sister Whicker addressed those present for a short time, thanking the sisters for their kindness; said she prized the address more than gold or silver. A vote of thanks was then returned to the committee for their exertions, and the entertainment closed with singing and prayer. Respectfully, Mary A. Bishop, Secretary. Deseret, Millard Co., April 8, 1885. The exhibition of Decorative Art work at Young Bro's on Main St., which commenced on May 12th, and has been continued since up, to the present, is something wonderful in the way of ornamentation, and requiring less natural ingenuity, it would seem, than embroidery done by hand. Everything, large or small, can be executed on the Domestic machine, on satin, silk, plush, canvas, etc., with chenile, arrasene, crewels, embroidery silk, tinsel, applique, mosaic and etching. Crowds of people were attracted every day to see the handsome and elaborate display of goods, and to watch those who were engaged in running the machines, doing all sorts of fancy ornamental work of different varieties and patterns with the people looking over in wonder and amazement. Surely this is something under the sun. Page 278"

In spite of curtailments and handicaps due to the war, the 1944-45 season has been a successful one marked by unusual development for Relief Society women and great accomplishment for the Society. With few exceptions, high standards have been maintained in all phases of the work, and Relief Society workers may justifiably view this past season with satisfaction and pride. The General Board sincerely appreciates the efforts of Relief Society officers and class leaders as well as the strength of Relief Society membership. It commends each one for her devotion to the Society, for the time, energy, and ability she has given to the work, and for the part she has played in the growth and advancement of Relief Society. It recognizes the support Relief Society women have given to the war programs sponsored by the Society, and the service they have rendered in their respective communities. The elements which make any organization successful are good beginnings or a sound foundation, a purposeful and worthy program, a capable leadership, and a devoted membership. Relief Society has all of these. It was organized by the Prophet \"under the Priesthood after Page 280 the pattern of the Priesthood.\" No more worthy objectives could animate any organization; namely, to develop its members spiritually and intellectually, and \"to manifest benevolence irrespective of creed or nationality.\" For more than one hundred years the leadership of Relief Society, including the general, stake, mission, and local leaders, under the direction of the Priesthood has been sincere, energetic, capable and above average; and no organization could boast of a more devoted membership? women who are bound together by the ties of the gospel and who value their organization as an auxiliary of the Church and as a medium through which women may attain full self-realization and render satisfying service. To be a part of such an organization is a blessing and a privilege. True, in the process of performing our part, those of us who have contributed to the onward march of the Society during the past season may have met with discouragements and with obstacles which have had to be surmounted under difficulties, but the surmounting of these, rather than retarding us, has actually developed and strengthened us. In total, the benefits that have accrued from efforts put forth should leave Relief Society women satisfied and happy at the end of this educational season. BSS."

If the 173,218 Salt Lakers will all just catch the spirit of homecoming, it will not be such a Gargantuan job to make a brilliant centennial showing. Here's How: Every home owner should take a 1945 spring inventory of \"dress-up musts\" and give them the works! New parking to be seeded; new concrete walks to be laid; a new roof for the home; two coats of fresh paint all around. Aged and decaying trees should come down. Alleys should be cleaned. During 1945 and 1946, neighborhood should vie Page 282 with neighborhood in this great home-coming dress-up! We shall be doing it for our own ?the best youngsters in the world! What we say for Salt Lake City, of course, goes also for every town in the State. The proposed 1947 centennial might well catch the spirit oi a great homecoming celebration/ Just as the pioneers in 1847 found their haven in Salt Lake valley, so, too, will our own young men and young women in the armed services be grateful?yes, unspeakably glad to be home. Business and Industry on the Job, Too! Just as each home must step out and dress up, so, too, must business and industry?new store front, new display windows, new interiors, new and finer signs. Down with shacks and dumps! Out with rubbish and junk! City, county, and State administrations must tie in with each other in selling their respective communities as being good places in which to locate new industries. Surely, by 1947, there will be some determinations regarding Geneva Steel which, if good fortune breaks just right, may prove the basis of an entire new economy for the Inter-mountain Empire. The newly electrified Northwest of Seattle and Portland will want Utah steel for their rapidly growing manufacturing industries, which will also undoubtedly help largely to supply a new China and a new Russia, as well as the great new Westl Salt Lake City Also to the Front! HE'S COMING HOME, LET'S SPRUCE UP! 283 The city corporation must also bend every effort to meet this call for a home-coming spruce-up. To the very utmost of our finances must our highways be put in shape. The incumbent administration is devoting its energies to getting the city out of debt and at the same time carrying on municipal improvements every way in its power. This is a Herculean task! At this time, new, large feeder water mains are being laid to take care of the homes on the higher east and north bench elevations. Salt Lake City parks are being put in the finest shape in their history. The mile track in Liberty Park, for instance, is being paved this year. And an ambitious paving program, together with extensive improvements, is also proceeding in the City Cemetery. Salt Lake City seriously needs an auditorium of ample capacity. Such a structure would provide the locale and facilities for many new community achievements. The easy way to finance this vital need would be to go in debt for it, by bonding. We are hopeful of being able to find another way, for borrowing would just add to our financial slavery. Our present bond retirement plan is a courageous one, and if strictly adhered to, will get our city reasonably out of debt in a few years. Utah's capital city must do its share to prepare for the great centennial home-coming. By getting the utmost out of every dollar expended, great achievement in city beautification can be wrought. Possibly, pending developments in municipal financing on which we are earnestly working, will help us also to meet the perennial community stumper: \"Well, Mayor, what are we going to use for money?\" Maybe, one of these days, we'll surprise the man who throws that question at us, by having an answer ready that will be an answer. Let's just see!"

            "content": "All-Year Care of the Rose Beds Hazel D. Moyle \"A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose? says that woman poet, Gertrude Stein, meaning, no doubt, that to say it is a rose is enough, for does not all mankind acknowledge the rose as the acme of perfection, the queen of all flowers! The back-yard flower gardener might, however, be inclined to add a more practical word or two to this poetic roundelay. Well do we know that roses do not grow in such obliging and supreme beauty unless we follow a few rules and regulations. We may purchase the finest and newest modern rose bush, guaranteed to be bigger and better than any other ever seen, but if we do not give that plant a little regular care, its blooms may prove to be disappointing. Roses do demand certain attentions, but few other flowers give such generous returns for the little they do demand. The plants often live and flower abundantly each year for a lifetime, requiring no replanting, resetting or dividing. The modern hybrid tea rose, which is the type now planted so universally in our gardens, blooms not once a year, but it often sends out two, three, and even four crops of flowers in a single season. Fall roses rival those of June in our Utah gardens, some rose lovers actually claiming that they excel the earlier crops. With the cooler weather, their colors are even richer and more brilliant than during the warm June days. Page 284 The attentions that roses demand are simple, the important point is, they must be given regularly. First of all comes the job of uncovering the plants in early spring (that is, if you live in a cold section where they need winter protection). Begin loosening the coverings as soon as the hard freezing is over, but do not actually remove it on the first warm day. Gradually uncover so that the tender wood which has been covered all winter can become accustomed to air and cooler temperatures. Likewise, do not cut the long old wood back until the buds begin to swell. Go slowly, even though you are impatient to begin work, because of late cold snaps of weather. But do not put off pruning until the top buds are actually growing actively, for this will take much of the stored-up strength of the plant which will then be lost as the plants are cut back. Consider all these conditions well, then use your best judgment as to the best time to begin. In pruning the hybrid tea roses, cut out all the weak and crooked branches at their base, preserving only the heavy strong canes. Cut out also any that grow toward the center and interfere with sun and air. Then shorten those you have selected to remain from eight to twelve inches. Sometimes winter has already done this and we have no choice but to cut away the dead wood down to the remaining plump buds. In colder sections the entire top growth may have been killed, but be comforted and cut away the dead wood even so, for fresh new growth will soon spring from the roots and you will still reap roses come year. A later, but perhaps an even better crop.\nCLIMBING roses need little pruning in early spring except the cutting away of dead wood ... and be warned that it is often difficult to detect just how much is actually dead. Leave your climbers strictly alone until growth actually begins so that you can be spared the sad experience of finding that you have removed branches that would otherwise be sporting a crop of lovely roses when June comes.\nThe best time to trim the climbers is just after they have bloomed. Such varieties as \"American Pillar\" and \"American Beauty Climber\" should have the old canes that have just bloomed cut away at the base to make room for the vigorous new shoots that will be found springing up from the root. These old canes of this type of climber do not bloom again and merely encumber the plant with dead wood. Get them out of the way as soon as possible after they have flowered. Such strong, large-flowered climbers as \"Silver Moon\" and \"Dr. Van Fleet\" need only the removal of the oldest wood occasionally after they have become established, to prevent the plant from spreading and also to keep it vital and alive. If left too long without this attention, it becomes almost impossible to remove old dead branches that will gradually choke it to death. These varieties need restraining as they mature (after two or three years' growth).\nA thorough cultivation of the soil of the rose bed is of the greatest importance as soon as it is workable in spring, and this will bring to light many pests that have buried themselves during the winter. Many claim that this is the best defense against the rose beetle, most devastating of all rose pests. Cultivate and stir right up to the base of each plant and stir in any mulch of manure that you may have been able to apply over the winter.\nAnd now we come to that subject of regular care which roses demand throughout the entire summer: cultivation, watering, and spraying. Of these three, cultivating comes first. We must keep the soil from getting hard and baked and firm, for the plants must have air, food, and moisture. Water will not penetrate unless the surface is kept loose and open, and our plants will then sulk and produce poor, slimy blooms. By beginning early and cultivating regularly the day following each watering, when the soil will again have sufficient aeration, this task is made easy, and it will at the same time prevent all weeds from growing.\nUse a long-handled, three-pronged cultivator, or any other convenient small tool that will suit your taste, but wield it often and regularly so that your soil will remain loose and open. A mulch of either old, well-rotted manure or of peat moss, or even of lawn clippings can be a great help in keeping the soil from baking, and this will also keep the ground cool and prevent weeds and conserve moisture. If we are fortunate enough to be able to put a two-inch layer of manure, then this will also act as a mild and steady feeding, as well as making an excellent mulch. Roses need rich fare, and they especially thrive on manure. Chemical fertilizers can be applied, too, if the manure is not easily procured, but these must be used strictly according to directions of the brand you select. In using this type of fertilizer, first loosen the top soil, then scatter the fertilizer in a circle about each plant, then apply a deep watering immediately. Such an application can be applied in the spring, and repeated two weeks after the first crop of bloom is over. Rose plants need plenty of moisture, although water should be applied by soaking deeply instead of sprinkling. Remove the nozzle from the hose and allow to run until the ground is well saturated. Then leave the beds until they begin to dry out before applying more moisture. Such a watering will last for a week's time if it is followed by a cultivation the following day. Pest control is also a regular requirement. The best control is to apply one of the all-purpose sprays available at all nursery stores, beginning with an early application as soon as the leaves have begun to open well, and continuing at two-week intervals during the growing season. By sucha program, one can prevent the many ills and pernicious pests from getting started. Remember that no matter what chemical spray or dust you use, it must be applied from underneath so that it reaches the underside of the leaves as well as the upper parts, for it is there that most of the creatures hide out. And the entire plant must be covered to catch any of the chewing insects no matter where they attack. Should your plants show signs of mildew?our most common plant disease, which manifests itself in a grayish, powder-like substance coating the leaves, use Massey dust, also secured at the nursery store, and if this is not procurable, apply dusting sulphur with a dust gun, coating the entire plant and repeating the application until the trouble disappears. There is one pest for which we have as yet found no cure. The villainous rose beetle appears in early June, just as your most lovely roses are coming into full flower, and it thrusts its terrible, long proboscis or beak into the very heart of the flower, despoiling and completely ruining its exquisite perfection. You must hand pick this creature if you would be free from its devastation. Arm yourself with a small pail of water and a little kerosene, then go forth to battle. Shake or flip each black, small bug (you will find them sitting stupidly among your treasures), into the water where it will drown. Its only redeeming feature is that the rose bug does not remain long, but eventually disappears, digging itself into the ground to lay its eggs for another generation of trouble for the next year. The early cultivation of the soil which we advised above will bring to light and destroy these new generations of this pest Active cultivation and feeding of the rose plants should stop after mid-August so that the wood may ripen and harden to withstand winter. New, soft growth will not withstand hard freezing. Winter pro-(Concluded on page 320)"

            "content": "Ten Miles to Calico Martha Robeson Wlight PART II THE next morning none of the neighbors showed signs of making a midweek trip to Og-den. The rutted road past the dugout remained empty. At breakfast, her father squinted quizzically at Tilda. 'Figgered how you're goin' to get your wheat to town?\" *Tt*s a problem/ she admitted. \"But I got to?today.\" \"A squaw would drag it on poles ?a travois.\" Tilda stared at her father. A shiver of delight rippled over her? not just because his suggestion was practical, but because of what it signified. First he had offered the twine. Now he'd got the answer to her transportation problem. Then her face fell. \"I don't know how you make a travois.\" \"I'll show you after breakfast.\" And as soon as he finished eating, he brought the axe. \"We'll fix your drag now, Tildy.\" While he selected and cut the right size willows, she yanked and slashed off wild grapevines to serve as ropes. When the travois was finished, it had a lashed platform for the wheat and a pair of shafts for Tilda. She cleaned herself up, braided her hair, and put on the hat her mother had woven for her from pond rushes. Ma brought a lunch?two pieces of cornbread and a cucumber?wrapped in a piece of flour sack. Pa carried out the wheat and placed it on the travois platform. Tilda laid her lunch beside the sack. She was dressed in her Sunday homespun, and wore her shoes. \"Take your flipper,\" ma directed. \"You might meet something.\" Tilda laughed, but she stowed the slingshot and a handful of pebbles in her skirt pocket. Pulling the drag along the road, Tilda pretended she was an Indian girl on the way to greet her warrior lover. She threw her hat on the wheat and hung her long braids over her breasts. With her belt and a turkey feather she found, she made an Indian headband. She had just donned it when old Bishop Robinson rode i|p behind her. \"Mornin', Gal,\" he said heartily. He had twinkling eyes. \"Good morning. Bishop Robinson.\" He cocked his gray head to one side. \"Let's see. Whose gal you be? I can't place all these children growing up so fast.\" \"I'm Mathilda Dawson.\" \"To be sure. Say, what you got there, Sister Tildy?\" \"A bushel of wheat I gleaned. I'm taking it to town.\" \"It's a right hot day for dragging. To save you the trip to Ogden I'll give you two dollars for your wheat.\" Tilda remembered that though the bishop was a righteous worker for the Lord, he had the reputation of being a shrewd trader. Page  \"What say, Tildy?\" he prompted. \"Whose field did you glean?\" \"Brother Burnett's/' \"He grows good wheat. Tell you, I'll make it three dollars.\" She didn't want to offend Frank's grandfather. She must refuse politely. \"Thank you, Bishop, but I got to take this to town.\" \"Why's that?\" The old man shifted his weight in the saddle. \"I got to buy me some calico dress goods.\" His wise eyes crinkled at the corners. \"Couldn't you buy the goods with the money? Easier than drag-gin' your sack so far.\" \"Calico's dear. Three dollars ain't enough.\" Would he be mad? He chuckled, \"That's the best I can offer. Well?\" She shook her head. \"Maybe you'll get more.\" He clucked to his horse. \"Giddap.\" The dust settled on Tilda. She plodded ahead. The heat grew intense and she stopped briefly to remove her shoes. It felt more comfortable to walk barefoot. Did squaws get this tired? After what seemed a very long time, she came to the river. She would have to carry the wheat across. Tilda caught up her skirts and fastened them around her waist with her belt. She pierced the feather through one of her braids. She unloaded the sack on a ledge jutting out from the river bank. Bending her shoulders, she hauled the heavy load onto her back, then walked cautiously into the shallow stream. The rocks on the bottom were slick. Minnows brushed against her legs. It was hard to keep her balance, but she reached the opposite bank and slid the sack to the ground. Tilda drew a long breath. She recrossed the river, got the travois and her shoes and hat, and brought them over, too. Now she'd eat her lunch. \"What's that you're so scared o' wettin', little Injun?\" A squat, red-headed man stepped from behind a tree. A tall, gray-haired man and a half-breed joined him. They had rifles. Tilda faced them defiantly, though she quaked inside. \"I'm no Indian,\" she said with dignity. \"This is wheat. I see you're strangers. If you are on your way to California, you're headed in the wrong direction. You go through Salt Lake.\" \"We done found that out,\" mumbled the gray-haired man. \"Boys, we can use that wheat, eh?\" 'An' take a load off the gal's shoulders,\" laughed Redhead. \"It's my wheat!\" Tilda crouched desperately over the sack. \"You get more,\" said the half-breed in threatening gutterals. The tall stranger roughly shoved the girl aside and slung the sack over his shoulder. \"Run back home or I'll smack you.\" Lowering her head like a goat, Tilda butted him. He stumbled and the wheat slid to the ground. But Redhead grabbed her arms. \"You big bullies!\" she sobbed, and kicked her captor's shins. \"Ain't you a hellion though!\" There was admiration in his tone. \"Now, Sis, skedaddle. Else I'll turn you over my knee and paddle you.\" A hot flood of mixed humiliation and rage engulfed Tilda. They went into the bushes with her wheat. TEN MILES TO CALICO 289 Two weeks of hard work! The tall man spoke to horses, then she heard wagon wheels creak. Tilda gulped her last sob. She wouldn't let them do it! She felt in her pocket for her flipper and pebbles. In a jiffy she put on her shoes. Those men didn't know this country. If she could make them think Indians were after them, they'd whip up their horses and maybe the jolting wagon would bounce the sack overboard. Keeping in the underbrush beside the rutted road, Tilda hurried after them as silently as she could run. She soon caught up to the walking team. Through the bushes she saw a covered wagon. The tall man drove. His companions rode saddle horses, in front and behind. She placed a stone in her slingshot, aimed carefully, and let go. \"Damned hornet!\" cursed the driver. Blood dripped from his cheek. \"No, that warn't a hornet, what was it?\" Tilda smiled grimly. In quick succession she fired her second and third shots. The half-breed and Redhead swore in pain. \"That must've been a arrow creased me!\" howled the driver. The girl started yelling, in imitation of Indian war whoops. She took deep breaths, opened her mouth wide and patted her palm against it. Tilda shot more jagged pebbles, and dodged about in the bushes. She made a great commotion, but stayed hidden. Redhead wheeled his mount beside the driver and shouted, \"To save our scalps we gotta leave the wagon! Climb on behind me!\" The half-breed was already in panic-stricken flight. The tall man and Redhead fled after him into. The underbrush. This was much more than Tilda had hoped. She ran to the wagon, scrambled to the seat, and started the horses at a brisk trot toward town. She'd deliver her wheat in style. In half an hour she backed up before Horrock's elevated unloading platform. As Tilda wrapped the lines around the brake handle, Frank Robinson came out of the store. Her successful coup against the three thieves made her feel like swaggering a little. She waved casual recognition to Frank so he'd know that he didn't matter any more. \"Hello!\" she called. He stood staring. Tilda climbed over the seat into the bed of the wagon and tugged her sack of wheat to the low tailgate. She poised there to step off onto the platform. The team moved and she lost her balance. Girl and wheat tumbled to the ground together, landing in thick dust. Her skirts were partly over her head. The old sack burst, and she was half buried in grain. The fall didn't hurt Tilda. Her first thought was of how she must look. She sat up and frantically yanked down her petticoats. She was so mad that she began to bawIl like a roped calf. Several men had seen her mishap. Frank jumped off the store platform and rushed to help her. Tilda was spitting dust and wheat. They were in her mouth and ears and hair, and inside her homespun waist. Her angry tears made mud smears on her cheeks. Since evidently only her feelings were hurt, the picture was too much for Frank and the other onlookers. They all laughed. Tilda stopped crying and glared around. \"There's nothing funny, about it! That was nice, clean wheat. Now look at it!\" Frank helped her to her feet and broke off his laugh. \"No, it wasn't funny, Sister Tilda.\" With a white handkerchief he awkwardly tried to brush the dust from her face. \"Thanks,\" she said in her stiffest tone. She jerked away. Some grains under her clothes were scratching her. She couldn't get them out with men around. \"Mr. Horrocks won't take dirty wheat.\" I?ll borrow a sieve from him,\" Frank offered. \"The dust'll blow off. I'll get a new sack.\" He leaped to the platform. Frank Robinson was kind, but he had laughed at her. And again he had seen her looking like all-get-out. So far as he was concerned it was no use to try to make herself appear pretty with a new dress. He'd never forget the sight she had been in Burnett's field, and now here sprawled on the street with her skirts over her head. Served her right for being so vain. Still, she had set out to get that calico, and she would?not to attract Frank, but to keep from being like ma. He came back with a shovel and sieve and a sack. The other men drifted down the street. Tilda and Frank didn't talk while they sieved her wheat and filled the new sack. The breeze blew away the dust. Frank carried the sack into the store. \"Mr. Horrocks,\" he announced, \"here is Mathilda Dawson with some wheat.\" The storekeeper peered over his spectacles at Tilda. \"I don't want wheat unless it's prime good. No smut.\" \"I gleaned it from Brother Burnett's field,\" she said quickly. \"Well, I'll take a look.\" Mr. Horrocks ran the full length of his arm into the sack and pulled up a fistful of kernels. He examined them critically while her heart filled her mouth. \"Yes, it's good wheat. Frank, take it back to the bin.\" Tilda breathed again. \"How much will you give me?\" \"I'm payin' three dollars a bushel to-day.\" \"Why!\" she exploded. \"Bishop Robinson offered me three. Reckon he'd have taken it to Salt Lake and sold it there for ten dollars.\" Horrocks looked at her shrewdly. \"Can't compete with Salt Lake prices. I admit it's good wheat, but five is the best I'll do.\" \"All right!\" she accepted. \"I mean five dollars in trade,\" the storekeeper amended. \"All right,\" Tilda repeated. \"And cash money if there's change.\" \"Yes. What do you want. Sister Tilda?\" \"Calico for a dress. Green. Maybe white vines or leaves in it.\" \"I've got some nice green. Only six bits a yard.\" The merchant selected a bolt of cloth. The lovely pattern and colors thrilled Tilda. This was worth all her hard work. She fingered the calico and her eyes lifted ecstatically. Then the joy in them died. On the shelf above Mr. Horrock's head stood a silver caster set. Exactly like ma's picture! Tilda couldn't speak. She just stared and pointed. \"That?\" The storekeeper reached TEN MILES TO CALICO 291 up for the caster. He set it before the girl. \"Pretty, ain't it? Took that in trade for some grub. Feller toted it all the way from back East.' 'H?How much d'you want for it?\" she forced herself to ask. Again Horrocks peered at her shrewdly. \"Well, that's real silver and worth more, but you can have it for five dollars. I don't have much call for such knickknacks.\" Tilda looked from the silver table-piece to the calico. She must not get like her mother. But if ma had this real caster set! Would it make her feel not so old? \"Got something to wrap it in so I won't scratch it carrying it home?\" The words were dead sounds that made hollow echoes of the longings she had killed. \"Here's the flannel the set was wrapped in,\" said the merchant. Frank Robinson returned from the rear of the store. \"She had 'most half a peck over a bushel, Mr. Horrocks.\" \"You have six bits change coming. Sister Tilda,\" the storekeeper calculated. \"I'll go get it from the money drawer.\" Slumped in misery, she gazed wistfully at the calico. Frank picked up the bolt. He flipped it round and round to show a length of the goods, then draped the cloth over her shoulder and smoothed it down to hang straight. It covered most of the front of her ugly dress. His rough fingers caught on her braids. \"With your yellow hair?,\" he paused, looking into her eyes. \"The green makes you like?like a daffy-dil. Like Spring.\" Numbly Tilda stared down at herself. At Frank's hand on her shoulder. At Frank. It was like a husband helping put a dress on his wife. His face turned brick red. He licked his lips. \"I was terrible forward.\" His words stumbled. \"I meant you'll be so beautiful in it.\" He wheeled and hurried out of the store. Tilda knew then the uttermost depths of wretchedness. Frank would never see her look like Spring. She'd always be in the dead blacks and rusty browns of a winter tree. Completely lifeless looking. For only a moment she had been transformed to beauty in his sight. Now she was ugly again. Mr. Horrocks brought her change. Her fingers closed listlessly over the two silver coins. She watched him wrap up the caster. She took the bundle in her arms. \"I could use more fine wheat like you brought,\" he remarked. Tilda burst through her numbness as if she had snapped rope bonds. Why, she hadn't half gleaned Brother Burnett's field! She could get another bushel of wheat as easily as the first! \"Here!\" Tilda thrust the coins into the storekeeper's hand. \"I'll be back with just as good a sackful. Take this money as part payment for six yards of that calico. The green! Be sure to save it for me. Promise!\" she demanded. He chuckled, \"It's a bargain. Sister Tilda.\" \"T'll bring the wheat in two weeks,\" she said. Tilda wanted to dance on the road home, but she had to be careful of the caster set. How ma's eyes would pop! Pa's, too. Tilda did a few cautious hop-skips, and sang, (Concluded on page 319)"

THE momentum of the 1943 Magazine subscription campaign, when 13,000 new subscriptions were added, carried over into 1944, resulting in a further increase of more than 4,300 additional subscriptions. By the end of the year the subscription list had reached a new high figure of 71,200, an increase over the 66,790 subscriptions reported at the end of 1943 of 4,210 or six per cent.\nMore Than 1000 Names On Honor Roll\nThis year we are not reproducing the pictograph which for the two previous years were published (August 1943 and June 1944) to portray for each stake and mission the rate of Magazine subscriptions in relation to Relief Society members. As usual, however, we are recognizing in the accompanying honor roll all stakes, missions, wards, and branches, whose subscription rates in relation to number of Relief Society members equal or exceed 75 per cent. The 1944 honor roll contains more names than ever before?1020, an increase of 22 per cent over the 847 in 1943 and of 159 per cent over the 293 in 1942.

Total on Honor Roll 847, 1020, 173, 20.\nThe honor roll is arranged in alphabetical order and the name of the Magazine representative appears opposite the name and record of each Relief Society listed. In those instances where no one is appointed as Magazine representative, the name of the president appears. Great credit is due the supervisory stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives, and all of the ward and branch Magazine representatives who have done the the ward and branch Magazine work of procuring subscriptions with the assistance and support of Relief Society officers and members. Page 292 THE MAGAZINE HONOR ROLL FOR 1944 293 We express the appreciation of the General Board to these faithful Magazine representatives and to all who assisted them. As an expression of its appreciation, the General Board is again awarding a free, one-year Magazine subscription to all local representatives who procured subscriptions equal to 75 per cent of the ward or branch Relief Society enrollment as of the end of 1944, and to all stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives appearing on the honor roll. The Magazine honor roll is based on subscription reports submitted to the General Board. However, Lethbridge and Oahu Stakes, and the British, East Central (except North Carolina District which submitted a report), Hawaiian, South African, and Texas Missions (of the English-speaking missions) failed to submit subscription reports for 1944. Also, a few districts of some of the reporting missions failed to respond?3 in the California Mission, 3 in the Northern States, 1 in Northwestern States, and 1 in the Southern States. Reference to the annual Relief Society reports compiled by the secretaries indicated that some of these unreported stakes and missions had local Relief Societies with rates entitling them to a position on the honor roll and they were, therefore, included. However, none is included from the British Mission from which neither report had been received by press time. 100 Percenters We especially congratulate the following 12 stakes, 1 mission, and 6 mission districts with Magazine subscription rates of 100 per cent or more, 12 of them appearing for the first time in this highest-ranking group: North and South Illinois District 102 San Francisco Stake 101 Uintah Stake 101 An amazing number of local Relief Societies achieved rates of 100 per cent or more?432 or 47 per cent of the 919 on the honor roll. These 100 percenters constituted 45 per cent or 304 of the 674 award-winning wards in stakes, and 32 per cent or 128 of the 245 award-winning mission branches. Some mission and stake Relief Societies have had unusual opportunity to place the Magazine in the homes of investigators and other non-members, and this yearns report shows that many have been diligent in this respect, as well as in placing the Magazine in the homes of Church members. Space limitations preclude special mention here of any but those with rates of 150 per cent or more, but all can easily be noted by reference to the honor roll. The 24 local Societies with exceptionally high rates are: Achievements oi Stakes Of the 57 stakes on the 1943 honor roll, all but 6 maintained this position. The loss of these 6 stakes (Lakeview, Mt. Graham, New York, South Sanpete, Star Valley, and Yellowstone) was more than off-set by 20 additional stakes which achieved honor-roll ratings. We extend congratulations to the 51 stakes which maintained their 1943 status and to the following 20 newly added stakes: Ben Lomond, Blackfoot, Bonneville, Chicago, Cottonwood, Denver, Emery, Liberty, Nampa, Oakland, Ogden, Park, St. Joseph, Salt Lake, San Bernardino, San Juan, Southern Arizona, Sugar House, Uintah, and Uvada Stakes. Many of these stakes nearly made the honor roll last year but in striving for honor roll position this year, several recorded considerable gains during 1944; for example, Uintah Stake which boosted its 1943 rate of 69 per cent to 101 per cent; Park Stake which rose from 74 to 103 per cent; Salt Lake from 65 to 88 per cent; Oakland from 66 to 86 per cent; Emery from 61 to 80 per cent; Sugar House from 56 to 75 per cent; Southern Arizona and San Bernardino both of which advanced from 71 to 89 per cent. Cottonwood Stake, also in this list, is mentioned in the \"Notes From the Field\" in this issue as having risen from a 1942 rate of 26 per cent?one of the lowest in the Church?to 90 per cent in 1944, a noteworthy accomplishment in a short period of time. Achievements of Missions All three of the missions which appeared on the 1943 honor roll-Australia, Western Canadian, and Western States?maintained their positions in 1944. The Australian Mission still leads the stakes and missions of the Church with a 1944 rate of 136 per cent. Three additional missions achieved the 1944 honor roll, not barely but with good rates?South African, 92 per cent; THE MAGAZINE HONOR ROLL FOR 1944 295 Southern States, 88 per cent; Northern States, 82 per cent. The number of mission districts (comparable in function to stakes) appearing on the honor roll increased from 11 in 1943 to 24 in 1944. Four of these 11 districts (Bakersfield in the California Mission, North Indiana and North Michigan in the Northern States Mission, and Great Falls in the Northwestern States Mission) failed to maintain their honor-roll rating. The other 7 districts which maintained their honor-roll status are: South Coast in California Mission; Central Ohio, North and South Illinois, South Ohio, and Wisconsin, in Northern States Missions; and Central Florida and South Georgia in the Southern States Mission. The 17 mission districts appearing on the honor roll for the first time this year are: Santa Barbara, San Gorganio, and Mojave of the California Mission; Central Indiana, East Michigan and West Michigan of the Northern States Mission; Northern Montana of Northwestern States Mission; Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, South Florida, South Georgia, West Florida, and West South Carolina of the Southern States Mission, and South Louisiana of the Texas Mission. Subscriptions From Non-ranking Societies Also Appreciated In addition to the stakes, missions, and mission districts whose local Relief Societies attained rates sufficient to place the entire area on the honor roll, 63 stakes and 10 missions are represented not by a rating for the stake or mission as a whole, but by one or more of their local Relief Societies which attained honor-roll status. Accordingly, a total of 134 stakes (all but 14) and of 16 English-speaking missions (all but 2) are represented on the 1944 honor roll by one or more local Societies. It is regretted that a few (Beaver, Panguitch, South Ogden, and Moon Lake Stakes, and the Hawaiian Mission) which were so represented in 1943 by high-ranking local Societies are not represented by even one ward or branch this year. Nevertheless, we are mindful and appreciative of the thousands of subscriptions which have helped to swell the total subscription list but which were obtained by local Relief Societies whose individual rates did not entitle them to a place on the honor roll. It is hoped that the accomplishments of the year 1944 will encourage these Relief Societies to renew their efforts during 1945 and match the achievements of their sister Societies. \n296\nHONOR ROLL\nRelief Society, Magazine Representative, Subscription Percent, Relief Society Members, Relief Society Secretary\nAlberta Stake Second, Clayton Stake Second, 85, 411, 117.

Pohlman Former General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for \"Notes from the Field\" appeal in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104.CAMPAIGNS\nCottonwood Stake\nTHIS stake has demonstrated that success may be attained by working steadily toward a goal. In 1942, this stake's rate of Magazine subscriptions was among the lowest in the Church?26 per cent. Stake and ward Relief Society workers, determined to increase the rate, made the greatest numerical increase in the Church during 1943 (from 211 to 580 subscriptions) but, nevertheless, fell slightly short of the honor roll with 71 per cent of their members as subscribers. They still persisted in their efforts, and now appear on the honor roll for 1944 with a stake rate of 90 per cent, and with 6 of 8 wards represented.\nMerle S. Muir, stake counselor in charge of the Magazine, wrote of this accomplishment:\n\"It is a satisfying climax to a huge effort and one of which we are very proud. This happens to be the first time in the history of our stake that we have been fortunate enough to achieve the honor roll. We hope it won't be the last. You will notice our subscription rate is 90 per cent for the stake and that 5 wards have over 100 per cent. All credit is due our ward Magazine representatives and officers for their effort and support. We found them willing and enthusiastic workers, and I'm sure the satisfaction they feel in their ward and stake report repays them for their efforts. As a stake we appreciate beyond words their efforts.\n\"Our biggest desire now is that each will read and enjoy her Magazine and realize the spiritual and temporal help it gives. As a stake we express our appreciation to the Magazine staff for the splendid Magazine they give us. We enjoy and appreciate the privilege of working in the Relief Society and the association it gives us.\"\nZion Park Stake\nJESSIE H. GIBSON, stake Magazine representative, wrote last January commending the ward Magazine representatives and officers for their efforts which placed this stake on the 1944 honor roll with a rate of 91 per cent. Five of the 7 wards of this stake also appear on the honor roll with high rates.\nHer letter continues: \"We feel especially proud of the record of Della Hardy, Magazine representative of Springdale Ward, who has placed the Magazine in every home in her community whether members of our Church or not. Several Magazines were also sent to other communities as Christmas presents. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 315 She exceeded her good 1943 rate of 86 per cent by the exceptional rate of 154 per cent for 1944. We feel that her leadership deserves a little special mention and hope it will inspire other Magazine representatives to try a little harder next year.\" Boise Stake CAROL R. FLAKE, president of * the Boise Fourth Ward Relief Society, wrote last August: \"At the suggestion of Dorothy Clapp Robinson, counselor in the Boise Stake Relief Society and supervisor of the Magazine representatives, I am sending in this account of our 'Dollar Day' which launched our Magazine campaign. Lillis Me-lander is our representative. \"A large group of our sisters met in the pleasant surroundings of Elm Grove Park where a program was presented featuring the importance of the Magazine to the entire family. Talks on the subject. Things I Like About the Magazine' gave interesting and varied reasons for having it in the home. Our stake Relief Society president, Josephine Anderson, and Counselor Dorothy Clapp Robinson, commended us for our achievement of 104 per cent in the 1943 campaign and urged us to include at least 6 subscriptions this year to be sent to our Church missionaries. Accordingly, our members deposited voluntary contributions in an attractive dish which was afterwards awarded as prize to the one guessing nearest to the correct total of $8.14 which was received. \"The program was interspersed with the singing of several original Magazine pep songs composed by various members, including the following: HERE IS OUR MAGAZINE Irene Read Tune \"Idaho\" (State song) You've heard of the wonders of our Magazine And all of the good it can do. It educates, stimulates, brings out the best But not half has been told to you. Chorus So here is our Magazine, Winning its way to the top. Once you've subscribed it will always come, You never will let it stop. You will read it, morn, noon, and night. Keep it in sight?'twill make your life bright. You will love it, its praises you'll sing, Sing of our Magazine. Our agent will take your subscription today. And benefits soon you will glean. When your family looks forward each month for the day When the postman brings their Magazine/ I'LL SUBSCRIBE FOR ANOTHER YEAR Edith Mathews Tune \"Auld Lang Syne\" Is my subscription up to date? I surely want to know. I cannot miss a single book Because I need it so. Our Magazine, our Magazine, Its pages I hold dear, I need its influence in our home? I'll subscribe for another year!\" As indicated by the foregoing report, the Boise Stake Relief Society officers suggested that each ward contribute 6 gift subscriptions for women in foreign missions, and some of the wards exceeded this assignment. The stake board itself set the example, sending in seven gift subscriptions, one in the name of each ward of the stake. This is another stake which exceeded its good 1943 rate of 80 per cent by a 1944 rate of 95 per cent for the stake as a whole. Five of the 7 wards appear on the honor roll, all of them with rates well above those of last year, four of them over 100 per cent. Western States Mission LUCEAL R. CURTIS, recently released Relief Society president of this mission, wrote in September 1944: \"Since March 17 our mission has had as one of its projects the binding ofs. One Relief Society now has a complete set of the Magazines bound and in its library. Two other Societies have 7 bound volumes and a great number have 3. These Magazines were bound to celebrate my three years in the mission. When they had them bound they sent, on July 15, a birthday card stating that they now had in their libraries bound volumes of the Magazine for 1941-42-43.\" For the third successive year this mission has achieved a place on the honor roll, this year with a higher rate of 81 per cent, and with nineteen of thirty-five branches represented, thirteen of them with rates of 100 per cent or over, including Sheridan Branch with the exceptional rate of 157 per cent.OPENS THE DOOR SPIRITUAL LITERACY SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE Magazine Campaign Poster, West Ensign Ward, Ensign Stake. Luendah E. Hagen was the Magazine representative of this ward. Ensign Stake LEONE H. ELIASON, stake Magazine representative of this stake which appears on the honor roll with a stake rate of 78 per cent and with four of six wards represented, suggested that each of the ward representatives make a poster for display in each Relief Society room. Each poster was to be original, to give some indication of the value derived from the lessons and other material published in the Magazine, to create interest in the Magazine among non-subscribers, and to serve as a constant reminder to subscribers to renew promptly. At a party held at the close of the campaign month, October in this stake, each ward representative was asked to bring her poster, and the display created much interest. The NOTES FROM THE FIELD 317 poster of the West Ensign Ward, conceded to be the best, is here reproduced. It aided the ward Magazine representative, Luendah E. Hagen, to reach the rate of 82 per cent with which this ward appears on the honor roll. A close second in popularity was the colorful poster of the South Twentieth Ward, depicting a cottage framed in trees, with a spacious lawn in front allowing for well-placed flower beds and borders. As subscriptions were received, the garden bloomed with tiny, bright-colored straw flowers, artistically glued in place. The energetic subscription gardener, Leone Seiter, appears on the honor roll with 131 subscriptions to her credit and a rate of 102 per cent. A feature of the party for ward representatives was the surprise demonstration of selling the Magazine which was given by Hazel Spencer of the North Eighteenth Ward (on the honor roll with 140 subscriptions, 79 per cent), with stake Relief Society president, Alice B. Steinicke, as the potential subscriber. Sister Eliason concludes that some of the qualifications of a successful Magazine representative are enthusiasm, willingness to serve, cheerfulness, and familiarity with Magazine content in order to be able to acquaint others with its value. MAGAZINE GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS In 1944, as in previous years, many gift subscriptions were received at the Magazine office from individuals and from ward and stake Relief Societies for distribution at the discretion of the Magazine office. These gift subscriptions are received with great appreciation by those to whom they are sent, principally missionaries and officers of new mission branch Relief Societies who may not have been able to subscribe immediately themselves. During 1944, these generous and thoughtful gifts aggregated $100 and came from all the wards of Boise Stake, Shelley First and Fifth Wards of the Shelley Stake, Worland and Byron Wards of Big Horn Stake, Tremon-ton Ward of Bear River Stake, Farmington Ward of South Davis Stake, and from Mt. Jordan stake board and the following wards of Mt. Jordan Stake?Crescent, Draper First and Second, Sandy Second and Third. COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE REPRESENTATIVES I regret very much to inform you this will be my last year as Magazine representative in Twin Groves Ward, Yellowstone Stake, as we have left the ward and moved into town. I never have done anything in the Church I have loved and enjoyed more, and my prayers and wishes will always be that Twin Groves will never fail to subscribe 100 per cent for this wonderful Magazine. We have 32 members enrolled in our ward... With 42 subscriptions or 131 per cent, the largest I have ever obtained and it really gives me a great thrill?Pearl Rigby, St. Anthony, Idaho. By the end of the year the rate for this ward was 145 per cent. I did my best to keep my promise to you. The sisters were very good to cooperate with me. I worked on the husbands, daughters, and sons the week before Mother's Day which helped a lot. Their faces would light up as if a great load had been lifted when I suggested the Magazine as a gift to mother. They would take the receipt and enclose it with their Mother's Day card. I work from eight to twelve hours a day in our grocery store besides caring for my three children and my home, so I can't do much Church work at the present time. I feel, however, I am doing a little something by getting Theinto the homes. One of the inclosed subscriptions is a gift from myself to a friend who is not a member and I hope the Magazine will help to do missionary work.? Irene Hardy, Susanville, California. This Magazine representative appears on the honor roll with a rate of 90 per cent. COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE READERS Inclosed please find one dollar for subscription for the Magazine. It might interest you to know that I have been a constant subscriber for the Magazine ever since it was first published and still enjoy reading it at the age of 85 years.?Salt Lake City, Utah. I am sending in one dollar for renewal of mysubscription. I enjoy the Magazine ever so much as we are now so far from our nearest Church that it is just impossible for us to attend. Fifty miles is quite a long drive on our present gas ration and therefore I enjoy my Magazine even more than most. ?Healdsburg, California. Thanks for a good Magazine that is still the same in price and value, in spite of high prices and shortage of material and help.?Snowville, Utah. Have neglected writing to you and letting you know how much I thought of Thelma Ireland's poem \"Moonlight on the Mountains.\" I have it framed and also it was read at the Woman's Club, and the P. E. O. Of this city. We thought it fine ?Creighton, Nebraska. Because of illness I have neglected sending in my renewal to our Magazine, but I won't miss a single copy of it. At this time I wish to express my appreciation of the wonderful way you are editing it? such clean contents from cover to cover? such advice, comfort and inspiration. It is a beacon light to me and an anchor to my soul.?Robin, Idaho. You'll never know how I enjoy Theevery month. Thank you so much.?Hondo, California. I thank the General Board, the editors and contributors, and all who are concerned with the making of the Magazine for the beautiful things that have come to me through its pages.?Helper, Utah. I enjoy my copies of the Magazine very much and shall continue to be a pleased subscriber. You are doing a very good work.?Logan, Utah. Just a brief word of appreciation for the Magazine. I have taken it from the first year and enjoy it more each issue. Thank you again for a fine and uplifting publication.?Charlotte B. Davies. I am just writing you a few lines to let you know how much I have enjoyed my Magazine. Never in my life have I gotten more good or consolation out of a book. I hope others enjoy theirs like I do mine.?Bremerton, Washington. I just want to thank you for the wonderful little Magazine. It is such a help to us in these awful days of war and I enjoy reading it after the day's work is done. What a wonderful testimony it brings? it strengthens my testimony of the gospel. Inclosed is one dollar to pay another year's subscription.?Boise, Idaho. The Magazine is a great comfort and companion to me in my loneliness. I have belonged to the Relief Society for about NOTES FROM THE FIELD 319 fifty years for which I am very grateful and proud-North Hollywood, California. We are a very young branch but are following the lessons and are thrilled with them. Words cannot express how we appreciate our wonderfulIt is inspirations.-Spokane, Washington. My husband is a splendid booster for the Magazine. We read it together and he likes it as well as any other magazine he reads he reads?Pasadena, California. COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE WRITERS I can't remember whether or not I wrote you concerning the contest poems and stories this year. I thought the poems were exceptionally good. Mrs. Crawford's so helpful, timely, and with her usual lovely spirit showing through; Mrs. Coles with her high grade poetry and high emotional quality; and Mrs. Miner with her abundant faith Ogden, Utah. I am always very proud to publish in TheSalt Lake City. You present the material so attractively it's always a great satisfaction to me to have a poem published in your Magazine. ?Silverdale, Washington. For some time now I have been wanting to write to you about the Magazine. There have been so many things lately that I have enjoyed.... I liked the story \"Mama's Boy.\" It carries such a wonderful message without seeming to preach, besides it is well written. I think we all enjoy our preaching better when it is hidden rather than held up to view?in stories I mean. I always enjoy those child stories of Olive Woolley Burt's.... The series of articles about painters by Mrs. Home have been especially pleasing to me. I had no idea we (the Church) had so many women who have distinguished themselves in that line. I liked the story of the Big Horn Basin, too.... The poets in this part of Idaho appreciate the market you give them. With all good wishes for your continued success.?Boise, Idaho. Ten Miles to Calico (Concluded from page 291) ?Five miles to calico! Five miles to calico!\" Then she laughed. ?Ten miles to calico! Ten miles to calico!\" What did it matter that she'd have to go to town twice for it? Her calico was in the store, waiting. She was going to look beautiful, like a daffodil! For Frank! Now she would walk home as fast as she could until the last mile. Then she'd run. So ma could have her caster set in the middle of the table while they ate supper. (The End) MORNING Susa Gould Walker A quivering stillness? The warbling of a wren; The fresh, sweet scent of dew-drenched lilac blooms. A smile, and two blue eyes Above a crib, and then My life made sweet, as sunshine floods the rooms. All-Year Care of the Rose Beds (Concluded from page 286) protection is seldom needed for roses in the Salt Lake valley, but in colder localities the plants must be protected.\nThe best protection is a mound of earth applied over each plant after freezing weather has arrived. This should be kept at hand ready to apply, manure can then be used to fill in the space between, but should not be applied directly over the plant during winter months. In very cold sections where the temperatures stay below zero for long periods, it is well to use additional protection of branches of trees, shrubs, corn stalks or other loose material on top of the mound of earth and manure.\nAnd so we come to the end of the story. Does this sound so very formidable? When once these simple tasks are learned, they become a pleasure, for their rewards are so great. Can one measure such small undertakings against the privilege of plucking flowers of such perfection and beauty as the rose! Can one coldly calculate a few hours of effort scattered over the year when they bring us roses to cheer and comfort, to speak their message of beauty and love!"

We'll Live Those Days Again Centennial Commission Gus P. Backman, Executive Secretary Written at the Request of the Church Beautification Committee WHILE the uncertainties of war have entered into every phase of every life, be it the life of the individual, the family, the community or the state, one thing is certain, the one-hundredth anniversary of Utah, its Centennial year, will be celebrated in 1947.\nEven under wartime conditions, if the war should persist until 1947, there will be an appropriate celebration of the anniversary. The Utah Centennial Commission, under the chairmanship of President David O. McKay, has assured that, and the setting aside of a possible $200,000 for the 1945-46-47 biennium by the 26th Utah Legislature has implemented that assurance.\nDue to wartime conditions, plans for the Centennial celebration necessarily must be fluid. They must be made with such care that they can be changed quickly to meet the stupendous and instantaneous changes in conditions induced by the developments in warfare. They must also endeavor to carry to the nation and the world the heroic tale, the saga of the Utah pioneers that little band of Latter-day Saints who fought the elements, the Indians, and every adverse condition to find in Utah their haven for freedom of religious worship.\nWith conditions most uncertain, with the possibility that travel to Utah by outsiders in 1947 may be almost non-existent, and with the chance for a national or international exposition in the State absolutely impossible because of building restrictions and shortages, the Centennial Commission, appointed by the Governor of Utah, has turned to other means of telling the world of the historic tale of Utah.\nThe Commission, therefore, has developed a new plan of observance of the celebration. It embodies: (1) a national publicity program calling the attention of the nation to the observance of Utah's Centennial; and (2) the development in all sections of the State of a program which will acquaint the people of the State with a proper background of its historical significance.\nThe program, originally projected under wartime conditions, is aimed at that two-fold purpose. To call the attention of the nation to the Utah Centennial, State assistance will be given in an effort to bring every national event, every publicity-wise happening to the State during 1947. Included are:\nNational PGA golf championships, national Clay Court championships, national slalom ski championships, national ski cross-country championships; national ski jumping championships, national rodeo championships in four major events, nationally famous football, basketball, track and field events, and other nationally famous events such as livestock championships, music festivals, minor sports events of national importance and others. Page 336 WE'LL LIVE THOSE DAYS AGAIN 337 \"WE'LL LIVE THOSE DAYS AGAIN\" Locally, the Commission envisions the promotion of such events as are typical of Utah, including the Tabernacle Choir, the Zion Park passion play, the Timpanogos hike, the development of the Great Salt Lake area, the story of the Mormon pioneers, and the promotion of Utah's scenic, recreational, and vacational assets. Thus, if traveling restrictions are lifted by 1947 for the general public, many may be attracted to the State. If they are still in force, through national events, nation-wide publicity may be obtained and, at the same time, the story of the development of Utah industrially, culturally, religiously, and in business may be impressed upon the people of the State. THERE are many facets to the celebration which are not yet developed. Actually under the State appropriations, the funds are not available until July 1, 1945. But, if var conditions permit, there are many events which are exceedingly interesting. For instance, if ODT regulations make it possible, and funds are available, there is a project to re-live the trek of the original pioneers across the plains. True to history, these modern pioneers will leave St. Joseph, Missouri, and follow the historic Mormon trail, hour by hour and day by day, re-living the life of the pioneers, making every one of the night stops, and holding services or camp-fire meetings just (Concluded on page 372) The New Latter-day Saint Hymn Book Elder Tracy Y. Cannon Chairman General Music Committee ANEW hymn book, to be used in all adult meetings of the Church is in preparation by the General Music Committee in co-operation with an advisory committee from the Council of the Twelve. The new books will supersede the present Latter-day Saints Hymns and Deseret Sunday School Songs. In addition to preserving those hymns that have been found to be of permanent value to the Church, the new hymn book will include some hymns with new music settings, a number of famous hymns from worldwide sources, and some original hymns, the words and music of which will be written by present-day writers and composers. Already many local poets have graciously responded to the General Music Committee's invitation to send in hymns, and the Committee is deeply appreciative of their efforts. It is now desired that music settings be made to some of the hymns, and composers are invited by the Advisory Committee of the Council of the Twelve and the General Music Committee to send in contributions according to the following suggestions: 1. The music is to be suitable in pitch, range, singableness and dignity for use by the congregations of the Church. Page 338 2. You are invited to make a music setting for any one of the poems here printed. (Please send in only one manuscript. ) 3. Sign your manuscript with a nom de plume. Place your own name and address in a sealed envelope and write your nom de plume on the outside of the envelope. Enclose this with your manuscript. 4. Send the completed manuscript to Carol H. Cannon, Assistant Secretary, General Music Committee, 200 North Main Street, Salt Lake City 3, Utah, not later than July 1st of this year. It is hoped that all musicians of our communities, schooled in the art of composition, will respond to this invitation. Following are five hymns for which worthy music settings are desired: SEE! ALL CREATION JOINS See! All creation joins To praise the eternal God; The heav'nly hosts begin the song. And sound His name abroad. The sun with golden beams. The moon with silver rays. The starry lights and twinkling flames. Shine to their Maker's praise. He built those worlds above. And fixed their wondrous frame. By His command they stand or move, And always speak His fame. The fleecy clouds that rise. Or following show'rs, or snow, The thunder rolling round the skies, His power and glory show. THE NEW LATTER-DAY SAINT HYMN BOOK 339 The broad expanse on high. With all the heav'ns afford, The lightning's fire that streaks the sky. Unite to praise the Lord. By all that shines above. His glory is expressed; But Saints who know His endless love. Should sing His praises best. HOW BEAUTEOUS ARE THEIR FEET How beauteous are their feet Who stand on Zion's hill. Who bring salvation on their tongues And words of peace reveal. How charming is their voice! How sweet their tidings are: \"Zion, behold thy Saviour King, He reigns in triumph here.\" How blessed are our ears That hear this joyful sound, Which kings and prophets waited for And sought, but never found. The Lord makes bare His arm Through all the earth abroad: Let every nation now behold Its Saviour and its God. SAVIOUR, REDEEMER OF MY SOUL Saviour, Redeemer of my soul. Whose mighty hand hath made me whole, Whose wondrous pow'r hath raised me up, And filled with sweet my bitter cup! What tongue my gratitude can tell, O gracious God of Israel. Never can I repay Thee, Lord; But I can love Thee. Thy pure word. Hath it not been my one delight, My joy by day, my dream by night? Then let my lips proclaim it still, And all my life reflect Thy will. O'errule mine acts to serve Thine ends; Change frowning foes to smiling friends; Chasten my soul till I shall be In perfect harmony with Thee. Make me more worthy of Thy love. And fit me for the life above. MAY THE LORD GO WITH US May the Lord go with us. And with us abide By His Holy Spirit To direct and guide. As from here we sever Now, and still forever May the Lord go with us And with us abide. May the Lord go with us. And His tender love. As a mantle o'er us, Still our shelter prove; Till with happy greeting, We, in joyful meeting. Lift again our voices To the courts above. May the Lord go with us, Then are we secure; Life or death befalling, We can still endure; With His arms enfolding  To His promise holding. We can travel onward. Ever safe and sure. LORD, WE COME BEFORE THEE NOW Lord, we come before Thee now, At Thy feet we humbly bow; Do not Thou our suit disdain; Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain? In Thine own appointed way. Now we seek Thee, here we stay; Lord, from hence we would not go, Till a blessing Thou bestow. Send some message from Thy word, That may joy and peace afford; Comfort those who weep and mourn. Let \"the time of love\" return. Grant, we all may seek and find Thee, our gracious God and kind; Heal the sick, the captive free, Let us all rejoice in Thee. And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER I \n\nDELSA came running into the house, her light brown curls flying in the wind, her blue eyes shining, her whole young body eager and confident, for Nellie Gibson, the postmaster's little girl, had said when she came back to school at noon, \"Your ma was in for the mail, and there was a letter from Hugh Temple for you, Miss Delsa.\"\nHer mother called from the kitchen, \"There's a letter from Hugh on the table, dear!\" and Delsa picked up the heavy gray envelope, scrawled across with Hugh's awkward handwriting.\nShe tore the envelope open, unfolded the gray sheets, and stood leaning lightly against the table, reading the words Hugh had written.\nHer mother came to the kitchen door, interested, persistent, and said, \"What does he say, Delsa? His mother's letter didn't come today \"\nWhat did he say? Delsa's eyes stared at the letter in her hand. What could she say he said?\n\"Oh, nothing much ,\" and as her mother still stood there waiting, she added, forcing her lips to form the words, forcing her voice up through stiff muscles, \"He's still in Australia can't say where or what he is doing, of course. He's okay \"\nShe turned and went swiftly from the room, up the stairs, before her mother's shrewd eyes could read her heart could see the devastation there.\nIn her own room, she flung herself on the floor by the window and stared out. Across the lawn she could see Hugh's house, Hugh's very window. They'd strung string across the space when they were very small, string tied to Delsa's big toe, so that Hugh could yank it and awaken her to go fishing in the little stream that didn't have any fish in it. Later they'd rigged up a tin-can telephone so they could talk to each other in code.\nWhat had Hugh written?\nNothing much, she had said. Just enough to wreck all the hopes and dreams of her whole twenty years; just enough to make the future a black waste with neither love nor joy in it.\nDELSA stared at the empty envelope on her knees. There was no need to take out the scrawled sheets again; she knew just what they said \n\"Dear Delsa I don't know how to say this \nBut he had said it. Hugh had said the words that ended everything. He wanted to break off their engagement. He'd found a girl, an Australian oh, she was different from anything he'd ever dreamed, and his love for her was different. But he wouldn't marry her unless Delsa would absolve him of the promises he had made to her.\nHow like Hugh! I consider those promises as binding as a marriage vow, Delsa. I meant them just as permanently when I made them. And I won t write to Mom about it. I feel like a heel, putting you in an awkward place like this, and I want you to handle it the way you think best.  Page 340 AND FOR ETERNITY 341 Tell them anything you wish. Both my Mom and yours are going to feel bad, I know. But they'll get over it and so will you, Delsa, long before I have a chance to come home with my bride. I don't expect you to forgive me, Delsa, but I hope you will forget, soon. Now I understand that was just a kid love I still feel it for you and when you meet someone you'll be glad this happened. I'll be waiting for your letter, Delsa. Be kind. Delsa's lips grew bitter as she thought, Be kind, Hugh? How can one kill one's heart kindly? And forget? Forget all those past years when she and Hugh had played together on the scraggly lawn between the two houses; when they'd eaten either at her place or his, without a thought of which was home; forget the affection that had bound them together, tight and brave against their little world? As they had grown older and Hugh's widowed mother had struggled to keep Hugh in school and the little farm going while she cared for his little sister, crippled with polio, and as Delsa's father, twisted with arthritis had found it difficult to make ends meet even in their small town, the two children had found strength and joy in their companionship. At high school they had gone in for dramatics and the school paper and debate and had made a name and a place for themselves. Hugh had seen to it that Delsa went to all the school dances, had all the fun the other girls had, and Delsa had seen to it that Hugh was never ashamed of his girl. They'd both worked so hard that they had won scholarships to the state university; and they had both tried to train themselves for worthwhile work in their little community  Delsa as a teacher, Hugh as a farmer. Then the war had come, interrupting their plans. Hugh had had to leave his school and his home and Delsa. \"We could get married now, Delsa,\" he had said, \"and have a little time together before, I leave. But \" the frown had deepened between his dark brows, and Delsa knew what he must, but hated to say. \"I know,\" she had answered. \"I know, Hugh.\" \"Mom's always been so poor. She's had to get along without so many things. I had planned to do some of these for her before we got married as soon as I finished school. But I can't now. I can't do any of them. The only thing I can do, Delsa, is send her my allotment. And if we got married \" \"She wouldn't want to take your money then, Hugh, and she would hate it as charity if I offered to help. You're right; we are young and strong. We can wait.\" They had walked along somberly after that, trying to hide the ache in their hearts the ache of waiting because they were young and strong and others had grown old and weak. Waiting for them to grow up. Hugh had come home on furlough before overseas assignment, and Delsa had felt that she could not bear to let him go again without binding him to her irrevocably. And Hugh had felt something of the same desire to cheat the fate that was separating them. \"Let's get married, Delsa!\" he had begged her. \"Let's get married right now. It isn't fair, it isn't right for us to wait when we don't know what will happen.\" Delsa had put her hands on his shoulders and kissed him tenderly. \"We can't, Hugh, and you know we can't. We've got obligations to others besides ourselves. You have your mother and sister I've got a job teaching. Our love is strong enough to wait, Hugh.\" Delsa's heart-had felt crushed and sore, but she had known that she must be the strong one. She had planned it out so many times, and had always come back to the fundamental fact that Hugh's pitiful allowance was not enough to split between two families . So at last, Hugh had had to give in, and that had hurt Delsa, too, even worse than it had the boy. But she had accepted the teaching job right here at home so she could still help her mother and Hugh's with her companionship and gaiety. And Hugh had gone back to camp and then across the ocean to a far, strange land. Delsa had been afraid of the war, of the danger and hardship Hugh must suffer, but she had never once been afraid of this. She had never once thought that anything, except death, could separate them. Oh, Hugh! Hugh! How could she tell her mother?\" Hugh's mother? They both counted on this marriage, had never thought of any other possibility. If they knew what Hugh had done, they'd be hurt and shamed, and Delsa couldn't bear to think of those two women whom she loved averting their eyes, apologizing to each other and to her. Delsa crept into bed; and when her mother, solicitous and loving. Came to see what was wrong, she said, \"I've got a headache, Mother. I gave examinations today and tried to correct the papers at noon and recess. I'll be all right.\" Mrs. Marriott folded the coverlet closer about her daughter, and laid a testing palm against her brow. \"It's Hugh,\" she said. \"Oh, the times are so hard on you young people. But don't worry, Delsa, Hugh will be all right. You have to keep that faith or you have noth-mg. Delsa reached up and pressed her mother's hand. \"I know,\" she whispered. \"I'm not worrying, really. Just tired.\" Her mother went out, closing the door softly. Delsa closed her eyes against the darkening room. A March wind blew fiercely about the house, shaking the trees outside Delsa's window, shaking the walls that needed repairing, rattling the windows, loose in their frames. So much still needed to be done about the place, Delsa thought wearily; her small checks helped only a little with the ever-recurring bills. She heard her father come into the kitchen below her, stamping his feet on the porch, wiping the mud of the March thaw from his shoes before he stepped onto the clean kitchen floor. She could almost see the pails, foaming to the brim with the fresh, warm milk, and her mother, holding the strainer while her father poured the milk into the pan. Her mother was talking, and though Delsa couldn't hear the words, she knew she was telling her father about Hugh's letter and how it had worried Delsa because he was so far away and in danger. AND FOR ETERNITY 343 Delsa thought, What if she were tellng him the truth, now? What would Dad say? What would he do? He wouldn't believe it Why do I believe it all at once like this? Why do I know without the slightest doubt that it is true? It wasn't only her father who would be incredulous. There were all her friends, the girls she had grown up with her crowd and Hugh's. She might meet Millie Lewis on the street and say, \"Hello, Millie. Have you heard the news? Hugh's marrying an Australian girl  some one he's met down there.\" THERE was a soft knock on her door and her mother came in very quietly so as not to awaken her if she was sleeping. Delsa said, \"What is it. Mother?\" \"Hugh's mother is downstairs. Gibson told her you got a letter from Hugh, and she wondered what he said. She didn't get one today, and she's worried.\" Delsa said, forcing her voice to sound firm and bright, \"Come on up. Aunt Martha. I'm just resting  had a horrible day exams and all.\" Hugh's mother came into the darkened room and Delsa explained lightly, \"My head aches from correcting papers. I can't bear the light. Aunt Martha. But Hugh's all right., He said he was feeling fine and he expects to be right there in the same place for some time. He's not in danger right now You know Hugh. He won't say anything the censor could object to, but he sounded safe and and happy.\" Why was she such a coward? She had to tell them sometime unless, unless she could go away, somewhere, and never see them or Hugh again. Mrs. Temple sat down beside Delsa's bed. \"You work too hard with those kids, Delsa. Heavens, they never had a teacher before that put in so much time with them. Even Jeff Holden, good as he is as a principal, doesn't kill himself, you'll notice. But you've told me what I wanted to know, Delsa, that Hugh's all right. I give thanks every day that it's you he writes to, so I can get a crumb now and then when my own letters don't come. Not that Hugh doesn't write to me often you know he does but he can't always write to both of us, now can he? So it's a good thing we're so close and can share and share alike. He's not been sick?\" \"No, he didn't say anything about being sick. Aunt Martha. He sounded right well.\" Share and share alike! Aunt Martha wouldn't like a strange, Australian daughter-in-law. But she would have to, if Hugh brought one home. Aunt Martha went on, \"Guess what I did today, Delsa? I finished piecing that quilt for you the double bridal ring, you know and is it pretty! I guess I'll have to have a quilting bee to get it quilted. But I reckon it won't be difficult to get folks to help with a quilt for your hope chest.\" She patted the coverlet and rose. \"You get a good night's sleep, Delsa. You take things easier. I don't want Hugh coming home and blaming us for letting you work yourself to a shadow. You wait till I see Jeff Holden and I'll give him a (Continued on page 371) Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, June 1, and June 15, 1885 \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations\" Essential Freedom: Essential freedom is the right to differ in opinion, and that right must be sacredly respected; nor must the privilege of dissent be conceded with disdain and coldness, but with cordiality and good will.

Without a full and cheerful recognition of this right America is only a name, her glory a dream, her institution a mockery.... S. A. Fullmer. Orangeville, Emery Co., May 10, 1885 Editorial: Some Affairs in England Gladstone's resignation of the position next to the Queen herself must have been a surprise to the English people, who look with such pride and admiration upon all places of honor near the throne, and especially upon any one who is in confidence of her Royal Highness. This movement will be likely to bring about serious consequences, although, perhaps the Marquis of Salisbury, whom the Queen immediately summoned to her assistance to aid in arranging matters with a view to creating a new cabinet, may manage the present crisis of affairs so diplomatically that the people will scarcely realize the radical change that is being brought about, for England has an adaptation in matters of State, whereby very grave questions are adjusted with such nicety and precision that the great world scarcely heeds it more than a ripple on a Summer era. In October, 1876, President Young called upon the sisters through the Woman's Exponent to lay up grain against a day of famine, and on the 11th of November following Mrs. E. B. Wells was chosen President of the Grain Association. At the same meeting measures were taken to publish a book called \"The Women of Mormondom.\" The Relief Society in the branches throughout the Stakes of Zion have been engaged from year to year ever since in the storing of wheat, and many of them have built store-houses of their own, in which to preserve it. Thousands of bushels have, since that time, been stored away by the sisters, and they look upon it as one of the important missions given them to perform.... R. C. Atwood. RELIEF SOCIETY REPORTS Whitechapel Branch, London On the above date (March 25th) was celebrated the eleventh anniversary of the Relief Society of the above branch by the usual concert or entertainment. The programme had received a wise and judicious censorship, and so nothing occurred or passed that could have offended the most cultured taste, or infringed in the least degree upon the rules of propriety. As Saints of God we desire to set a good example in all things, even in our amusements. In this limited space all that can be done is to make a passing reference to a few, who, by their talents, seem to demand some notice. All, however, tried to do their best. I will here remark that the concert was graced with the presence of Elder C. W. Penrose, the talented Editor of the Deseret News.

Cannon THE December bulletin of the International Council of Women carries a message from the Council's president, the Belgian Baroness Marthe PolBoel, exulting in her country's regained freedom, and expressing deepest gratitude to its liberators. She asserts that even in their darkest hour the Belgians did not doubt either their friends or themselves. During the Baroness' internment, Dr. Renee Girod carried on as acting president from neutral Switzerland, while Lady Nunburnholme, first vice-president, issued some of the bulletins from London. Says the latter, world peace will be very difficult to attain, but \"every new birth is linked with pain.\" IN most countries, the National Councils of Women are working for greater social security and an equal wage scale for women and men. In addition, the 'Belgian women are asking for: the vote; women police; a woman member of the national radio-information council; medical examinations for returned prisoners and deportees; the same treatment for widows of Belgians executed for patriotism as for regular war widows. DURING the past year American women have had a voice in international councils. Dean C. Mildred Thompson of Vassar College was a delegate to the Allied Ministers of Education Conference in London. At the Hot Springs, Virginia, Conference on Food and Agriculture, Josephine Schain was a delegate from the United States. Mrs. Ellen S. Woodward, a member of the Social Security Board, and Miss Elizabeth Conkey were American delegates to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Conference. Our women also attended the International Labor Conference held at Philadelphia, April 1944. OF the 125,000,000 impoverished people of Europe, great numbers of children are living in roofless homes. In many cases ten people must live in one room. There is much hunger and lack of adequate clothing and bedding. AMONG our American WAC are 315 young Indian women.

Grant RELIEF Society has sustained a great loss in the passing of our beloved and revered President, Heber J. Grant. For many years this organization has enjoyed the personal interest of this great Church leader. It has benefited from his thoughtful considerations, his wise counsel, and his generous support of its varied activities. President Grant was the son of a Relief Society mother. For thirty years Rachel Ivins Grant served as president of Relief Society in the Thirteenth Ward. From the time he was a small child until he grew too old to attend. President Grant accompanied his mother to Relief Society meetings where he became familiar with the work of the Society and learned of its importance and value. He became acquainted with early-day Relief Society leaders, enjoying a personal, intimate association with these sisters. He observed their nobility of character and their devotion to duty and he has often borne testimony of their influence upon his life. In an address given at a general conference of Relief Society in 1937, he paid a tribute to these sisters as follows: \"I owe more to the love and teachings of my mother, to Eliza R. Snow and the Relief Society sisters than I do to the brethren. Why? Because I grew up from a little child in the Relief Society meetings. Mother had no one to leave me Page 346 with, and I played on the floor in many of those meetings. Aunt Eliza used to talk to me by the hour and tell me things about the Prophet Joseph Smith, and it inspired in my heart a love for him almost beyond my ability to express; in fact, my mother, Sister Snow, and others, inspired in me a love for the Gospel and the Prophet Joseph Smith and the authorities of the Church by their devotion to the work of God, by their example, not by talk alone.\" In a message to Relief Society women, October 1940, President Grant paid the following tribute to Relief Society general presidents and Board members: \"Every president of the General Board of Relief Society has been a devout, intelligent, fine, loyal Latter-day Saint; and I have known most of the members of the Board, and they are among the choicest of our people.\" President Grant has continuously encouraged Relief Society women and his blessings have sustained them. At the time of the Relief Society Centennial observance when, due to the engagement of the United States in war, the planned Centennial program had to be greatly modified and when the sisters with anxious hearts faced the trying experiences which accompany war, President Grant's words of instruction, commendation, and blessing were a guiding power and a comforting influence. He prayed for them: \"May our Heavenly Father bless the mothers in Israel and all who are engaged in building up the kingdom of God on the earth. May the peace and blessings of heaven abide in your homes and be upon you and your loved ones now and forever.\"\nRelief Society women are grateful for the life of President Grant. They acknowledge his support, the wisdom of his leadership, and the influence of his testimony. His greatest desire for us was that we live in accordance with the teachings of the gospel and that we zealously devote ourselves to the work of the Church. May we ever honor him by so doing. May the comforting blessings of Heaven rest upon Sister Grant and the other bereaved loved ones.\n?B.S.S. SENTIMENTS OF PRESIDENT GRANT If I know my own heart, I believe it is set upon the advancement of the Church and kingdom of God. I know that there is nothing on the earth that I rejoice over so much as I do in the fact that I am associated with the servants and handmaidens of God in the Church of Jesus Christ; and I do not believe that there ever is a day that passes over my head that I do not thank God for the restoration again of the plan of life and salvation, and that I have been made a partaker of the same. I supplicate Him earnestly that my mind may never become darkened, that I may never depart from the truth; that I may never forget any of the covenants that I have made, but, as I grow in years and increase in understanding, that I may grow in a testimony of the gospel and in the desire?not only a desire, but in doing it ?to labor for the onward advancement of the kingdom of God on the earth. I have perhaps announced before, but I will announce again, that in a meeting of some of the Presidents of Ward Relief Societies held in the Salt Lake Stake, which then embraced the entire County of Salt Lake, I was a child, playing on the floor. Eliza R. Snow had the gift of tongues, and Sister Zina D. Young gave the interpretation, and predicted that I should live to be one of the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ in this last dispensation. Naturally, I have been very grateful for that splendid blessing given to me. At that time I did not understand it, I did not comprehend it?did not know anything about it. I look forward with the keenest pleasure of meeting in the hereafter Hamilton G. Park, George Goddard, Bishop Nelson Empey, Bishop Edwin D. Woolley, Bishop Milieu Atwood, and others who have made an impression for good upon my mind and heart as a boy. I could mention scores of others to whom I am indebted. I shall be grateful throughout all the ages of eternity to those men for the impression that they made upon me. We may think that the impressions we make may not be lasting, but I can assure you they are, I am sure that a testimony borne by a teacher to little children, under the inspiration of the living God, is a difficult thing for them to forget. Home Problems In Wartime Edna K. Ward WE who cannot carry the gun can still carry on. To our husbands or sons in the fox holes or in the jungle, thoughts of home and of mother sustain them during the awful experience and stress of war. Our duration duty in addition to war activities is to preserve the home as he remembers it. In reviewing some of the practical problems that wartime shortages and restrictions create, let us consider possible means of prolonging the life of the following furnishings and equipment in the home: Draperies Curtains Blinds Carpets Furniture Linens Kitchen equipment Shoes At the present time all fabrics are very difficult to replace. The new, postwar fabrics promise to be something well worth waiting for. A great many will be immune to ordinary wear and tear, resistant to soil and dust, easy to clean and sun-fast. Rugs and woolens will be moth proof, blankets will refuse to shrink, and organdies and window curtains will retain their crispness. Making our present fabrics last through serves two good purposes: (1) lessens the demand on our present, limited civilian supplies. (2) invites replacement with the newer textiles that will be available after the war. This replacement is a backlog of postwar employment. Page 348 Draperies and Curtains The greatest enemy of fabrics is the combustion products in the atmosphere of our cities, especially in the winter time. These products, plus moisture, create acid chemicals that attack the substance of the fabric. If draperies and curtains are cleaned with vacuum attachments regularly through the cold winter months the wearability and beauty will be greatly improved. 1. Where there is city smoke, vacuum and brush draperies and curtains once a week during the coldest winter months. 2. Wash glass curtains when needed, using careful methods of handling, mild soaps, and proper water temperature. 3. Darn tiny breaks or holes in glass curtains with threads of the curtain material from the turned hem. (Most curtain hems are double.) Do this before laundering. 4. If stretchers are used, measure curtains before laundering and set stretchers 3-4 inches narrower to prevent the wet material from splitting under strain. All rayon loses tensile strength when damp. The new postwar material will not need to be stretched. 5. For spring cleaning, lay draperies on sheets spread on the floor and wipe with numerous Turkish towels, using non-inflammable cleaning fluid for spots. Blinds Most blinds are washable. These can be laid flat on the floor on a sheet and warm soapy water used with a washing cloth, a rinsing cloth, and a dry cloth. If wiped dry they can be rolled and replaced at once. Do not rub parallel to the edge? this tends to stretch the edges. Carpets Regular vacuuming keeps rugs and carpets clean. The rotary-brush-type vacuum should not be set too low or it tends to beat the nap out of the carpet. With the deeper pile rugs, soiling will be mainly on the surface and spots and respond to an old bath towel wrung from soapy water or moistened with non-inflammable cleaning fluids. Never use gasoline in the home. Many serious accidents have resulted from the use of inflammable cleaning fluids which are ignited by the static electric spark created by rubbing.\nRugs should be turned to avoid wear in places of most use. Throw rugs or places of heavy traffic are a good investment.\nStairway rugs can usually be reversed to bring edge wear on other places. Extra length tucked under at one end can be moved up to bring tread wear to a new surface.\nFurniture\nThe fine surface and finish of good furniture requires very little attention other than frequent dusting. Two or three times a year the surface should be washed, using a mild, soapy water, a clean rinse cloth, and a dry cloth. Then apply furniture polish with a damp cloth. Allow to dry one-half hour and polish.\nLight scratches and marks are improved by using a mixture of beeswax dissolved in turpentine until the mixture is the consistency of molasses and applied with a woolen cloth.\nUpholstered furniture keeps clean with frequent brushing and spotting with non-inflammable cleaning fluid.\nTufting buttons may be replaced with a mattress needle and heavy linen twine. This tufting helps keep springs in their proper place.\nHousehold Linens\nAll mattresses should be turned once a week. Mattress pads or folded cotton blankets can be kept fresh by frequent laundering. The habit of shaking all quilts and blankets at least once a month aids in keeping lint from accumulating. Changing both sheets at the same time makes a really fresh bed, rather than only a half-fresh bed where the top sheet is used for the bottom.\nTo preserve linens (sheets, tablecloths, napkins, handkerchiefs) don't iron along the folds where wear shows first. Small linens like napkins, luncheon cloths, handkerchiefs, and guest towels can be ironed flat, laid out on a table or rack and then folded by hand. All table linen will wear much longer if rolled. Bamboo poles on which carpets are rolled, or pasteboard rolls covered with tissue paper may be used. This is the place to utilize those Christmas wrappings you saved?for the rolls themselves and to cover the linens.\nWorn sheets can be torn down the middle, the outer edges sewn together and the resulting outer edges hemmed. This will give many extra months' wear. Worn sheets also can be cut down and hemmed for crib sizes, made into pillow cases, or used as covers for summer dresses and suits stored in closets during the winter, and vice versa for winter garments. When changing a sheet be careful \nnot to pull it off without first releasing it from bottom and sides. Flour and sugar sacks used for dish towels gain appearance and life when hemmed. Our mothers and grandmothers used these sacks for children's undies. With children's clothing selling at the high prices it is today, and materials so difficult to get, why couldn't this old-fashioned, thrifty habit be revived using modern innovations? Linoleum Many of the linoleum factories have closed, and many are closing this spring as are also the rug and carpet factories. Linoleum can be preserved to double the wear by regular waxing. Either liquid or hard wax may be used. The writer has just recently tried a new, clear plastic paint on her linoleum drainboards that also may be used for floors. It gives a shiny, smooth appearance and claims preservation of the linoleum. These new plastic products promise to fulfill many needs in the home as they are smooth, resistant to heat and staining, and are highly durable. Refrigerators and Ranges Refrigerators should be cleaned regularly. Enamel is preserved by avoiding hard knocks on the inside or outside. The \"handy man of the home\" or the utility service man can at intervals check the fan belt, clean the deposit from the radiator, and oil the motor in the electric-type unit. Units on ranges last longer if food is not allowed to boil over, and if the units are lifted out and cleaned carefully, but thoroughly, after each use. Turn units to low or simmer to keep foods just at the rolling boil. This helps prevent scorching, saves fuel and often keeps things from boiling over. Avoid opening oven doors carelessly or placing heavy objects on oven doors or dropping them onto the enamel. Repair service cannot be had at once, and parts often cannot be replaced. Have a place of storage for each piece of the small kitchen equipment. This will save your time, your disposition, and your equipment, and, in addition, it will greatly improve the orderly appearance of the kitchen itself. A clean, well-organized, well-lighted kitchen is the \"heart of the home.\" From that kitchen come many of the pleasant memories that our boys are dreaming about right now in their fox holes. And very soon after returning, it is the place to which they will gravitate. Shoes One of the real problems now with shoe rationing is prolonging the life of children's shoes. Our fathers owned a shoe last, an awl, a hammer and a box of tacks. Leather soles costing twenty-five cents were tacked on as the original sole began to fail. This doubled the life of a shoe and could sometimes be repeated. The revival of this thrifty custom, particularly with large families, would ease materially the strain on the budget and the shoe coupons. Let's take care of our homes. The old things that have had loving care and been preserved are often much more beautiful than newer, flashy modern things. Unanswered Prayers Marguerite J. Griffin \n\nSPUNKY our cat died, but will never be forgotten. The boys accepted the event as something from which there was no appeal, but my little daughter's heart seemed torn with the longing that it might not have been. Perhaps the boys felt these same emotions and only kept them buried. In any event, it was she who a few days later brought her disturbed emotions out into the light to me.\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"while you took Spunky to the hospital, I went up to my room and prayed three times.\" There was emphasis upon the numeral. \"Doesn't God love cats like he does people?\"\nThere was no humor in the eyes of this little daughter of mine. This was one of the most serious questions she had ever asked me in her eight years. She had been taught to pray. She had been taught to recognize God's blessings. She had believed she need only ask and he would hear and answer her prayer. But this time?this time when she had sought him urgently thrice, he had failed to grant her request. Spunky's life had been taken.\nSearch your hearts, adults. Has the same question ever gnawed at your peace of mind? Have you ever thought, \"It is no use to pray, God may not hear\"? Can you recall, now, some of the stories that have come out of this war, of men abandoned on sea or desert, who, motivated by the sharp pangs of physical hunger, have united their voices together in prayer to be saved, sustenance and for food? Can you recall how some of these men, when the answer seemed delayed, ridiculed the idea that there is a God, while others kept their faith and waited in patience until the reward at last came.\nPatience comes into a man from an outward source, from a faith in something bigger than himself. The captain who knows his ship well, who has faith in the skill of the company which created it for him, can ride through the stormiest squall in it, secure in the knowledge that it is a good ship and will weather the storm, whereas the humble passenger who is in ignorance of the vessel's quality, who has never before faced a storm at sea, may find his physical body torn and weakened by an overpowering terror that it worse than the raging wind and weather. However, in the landwork of men there is always the possibility of flaws, there is always reasonable doubt. The storm might bring to light a defect in the boat's construction, a weakness in some spot that might mean danger. The captain knows this and places special watches throughout the storm. The crew becomes more vigilant. If an emergency arises?well, it is emergencies that test the mettle of men, be they passengers or captains. And there are some terrors under which the delicate mechanisms that are flesh and blood and nerves break, if they have nothing stronger than themselves to cling to.\n Page  But there was once a Man, who, by a gentle word, stilled the winds and the waves of Galilee when his shipmates cried out in fear of the storm. He himself could have slept through it unafraid, but when they awakened him, he answered their need. He lives yet to calm the troubled heart. If he quieted the squall, can he not do as much to your fears? Peace, my heart, be still. So I told my little daughter the story of the Man of Galilee who was God's very own Son, and how he prayed so fervently in the Garden of Gethsemane when his soul was \"sorrowful even unto death\" because of the thing which lay ahead of him to do. Though he was a God, yet he shrank from the pain, from the anguish of the ordeal. \"Father,\" he prayed, \"all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.\" Three times he offered this same plea, \"If it be possible remove this cup.\" But the prayer was not answered because it was not his Heavenly Father's will, and Christ prayed for his Father's will, not his own, to be done. On our part we often ask for things which are not good for us, or which would deny others. What would have happened had God spared his Son's life? What would have been our state, yours and mine? Sometimes it is hard for man's logic to perceive just why this is so, but the scriptures tell us: \"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead; for as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" According to the great plan, had Christ failed in his mission, death would not \"have been swallowed up in victory,\" and where then, would have been our hope? Divine purposes are not always understood by the human mind, but in the family circle we come nearest to the type of heavenly things. As we are concerned with the welfare of all our children, so our Heavenly Father's work and glory is the salvation of all of us, not just a select one or two. Do we as earthly parents allow our little ones to select, as the only food for their meals, the sweets which, of course, are the most tasty to their tongues? Ask any small youngster what he would like for dinner. He may say, as often as not, \"Cookie\" or \"Ice cream.\" But no loving parent would grant him that request first. For what would happen? The child would have no appetite left for milk and vegetables, the nourishing elements from which his body must grow. So he sees no cookie on his tray at first, and sometimes he frets about it, but after he has eaten the needful things, then comes the dessert, last of all. So, often, we are like children. We want the sweets of life right now, not realizing that a taste of the bitter first but makes us enjoy the sweetness more. \"Be not children in understanding: Howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.\" God's ways are not the ways of men, but we can be sure his ways are best. Sometimes I think if we could only see more clearly, if our eyes were envisioned to a time longer than the bounds of our short years, we would discern that even our worries, our troubles, our sufferings, but give us greater strength for future days.\nIN October of 1941, so shortly before Pearl Harbor, my husband and I took a trip in our car, traveling through some six of our Western States. This was in the days, you remember, when there was plenty of gasoline and practically no speed limit on the open road. I recall that vacation now with nostalgia, even in spite of the fact that for the first few days we were most sorely vexed with flat tires. What annoyance when our time was so limited and we wished to travel so far! What vexation as, one by one, we discovered that the new tires which had been on the used car we had bought some six months previous were filled with old, patched tubes, or tubes too large for the tires. With the little driving we had done around town we had had no trouble, but now, spinning along the open highway, it was a sequence of purchasing new tubes. This distressed us, too, for we had made a very close budget, and this unexpected expense strained it considerably. We thought fate was harsh with us.\nAt the moment, nothing seemed worse than the delays and expense, but the events of a restless world moved rapidly, and we saw the outcome of this experience in a very short time. Then it took no special sort of genius to realize how lucky we had been, for we were ready to face the duration with brand new tubes in our tires, whereas otherwise (perhaps I should say by now our car would not have been available for use on the guest emergencies. We've often spoken of this and have been ashamed of our annoyance, yes, our anger even, those first few days of our last traveling vacation. Now I try to remember the lesson of the tires when new problems and worries come upon me, and I tell myself: \"If I could just see a little farther, maybe this, too, will be for the best.\"\nPaul said, \"We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.\" I am learning to realize that, too, as experiences come in life. I am learning that the important thing is to love God no matter what happens to us, no matter if he denies is our petition today, no matter if our hearts or our bodies must bleed and suffer, no matter if it would seem that he has forsaken us or is scourging us with many stripes.\nHave ye \"forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, my son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?\" And while a son may be rebuked more bitterly than a servant in the house or a guest, remember that his status and rewards are vastly different. He is heir to all that his father has. \"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: Shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits and live? . . . Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: Nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.\"\nBut regardless of what we must own, \"And the Lord turned the captivity of Job\" (and you know how much he had endured) \"when he . . . prayed for his friends.\" Even a child can understand the glory of this.\n\"I shall pray for my brothers,\" said my little daughter. They are sorry Spunky's gone, but they don't say anything. They must hurt a lot inside.\"\nOh, yes, let us pray for each other and for a pain-racked world. Let us pray for our brothers and our neighbors who share our burdens. Let us not even forget our enemies, \"for they know not what they do\"\nor our foe, that has a reward of its own. \"And the Lord turned the captivity of Job\" (and you know how much he had endured) \"when he . . . and mark you well these words . . . when he prayed for his friends.\" Even a child can understand the glory of this.\n\"I shall pray for my brothers,\" said my little daughter. They are sorry Spunky's gone, but they don't say anything. They must hurt a lot inside.\"\nOh, yes, let us pray for each other and for a pain-racked world. Let us pray for our brothers and our neighbors who share our burdens.

Courage Is the Word for It Mildred Steelman WHEN Margaret stood on the station platform with Stephen and Bill, the numb feeling which had possessed her for days melted away. All the past hectic week she had made plans and decisions, but they had seemed to be for someone else, not for Margaret Jamison and her husband and her son. The salty taste of tears made her swallow. It was no longer just any officer who was going overseas. It was her husband. \"Take care of your mother, Bill,\" Stephen was saying, and his voice had a deep huskiness that Margaret had seldom heard in it. But his words made her upper lip curve into a little crooked smile. \"I will. Dad,\" she heard Bill say. She hadn't realized how tall he was getting, almost as tall as his father. They were shaking hands like two men. Then Stephen had her in his arms. \"God watch between me and thee,\" he said. Margaret hid her face against his chest. Stephen held her close. \"Oh Stephen,\" she said, \"Stephen,\" but she smiled into his eyes. Then the train was under way and he was waving from the vestibule, a tall man with a kindly face and gold oak leaves on his shoulders. Margaret waved frantically and knew that Bill was waving, too. At last she felt the quick pressure of his hand on her arm. \"Let's go. Mom,\" he said jerkily. \"Fm hungry.\" But she read concern for her in his eyes. If only he didn't have to go back to Seattle tonight, but he musn't miss any more time at the university. She was going up there herself in a few days, just as soon as she could wind things up here. Last fall she had leased their home in Seattle in order to be near Stephen. It was wonderful that the tenants were leaving, that she could have the house back. The train was out of sight now, and for the first time she realized that the station was full of people who had come, as she and Bill had come, to say goodbye to their soldier. Instinctively she put her hand up to see that her hat was in place. It was a little red hat and there was charm in the way she wore it. Candor and strength of purpose were in her hazel eyes. \"All right. Bill,\" she said, \"like to drive?\" \"O. K.,\" Bill said, and then, \"Jeepers, there's Sally Sue Crandall, Julia's little sister. Hi, Sally.\" \"Hello,\" she called. \"Wait Bill,\" and Margaret saw her running toward them, her brown curls blowing back from her face. She was out of breath when she reached them. \"Oh,\" she said to Bill, \"I thought you were alone.\" Bill laughed down at her. \"Mother, this is Sally Sue,\" he said. \"I'm glad to meet you, dear,\" Page  Margaret said. Pretty as a picture, she thought, and about thirteen. \"Got any business to be here?\" Bill asked, \"because if you haven't-\" \"You needn't be a meanie,\" Sally Sue pouted. \"Cora had to drive down to Olympia on business and I came along. Cora is my stepmother,\" she explained to Margaret, then her face crinkled into a smile. \"It was dreary waiting at the hotel, but it's fun to watch a troop train leave.\" \"That so?\" Bill said, his voice deep in his throat. \"Gosh, Bill, you've been seeing your dad off.\" Sally Sue's brown eyes filled with tears, \"I'm sorry.\" She's sweet, Margaret thought, and that's all the more reason why she ought to be spanked for hanging around a station. \"O. K., Kid,\" Bill said, \"we'll drop you off at your hotel.\" \"Well, all right, but don't you dare tell Cora or Julia.\" \"Not this time, but if ever again?\" Margaret looked into their serious faces and her throat ached. It didn't seem long since Bill was Sally Sue's age and there were always a lot of things for which he needed to be scolded. And now he was growing up. But she crowded that thought down. At least he had been deferred to continue his engineering course. In the car Sally Sue chatted gaily with an occasional, \"Don't you think so, Mrs. Jamison?\" But Margaret was thinking about Sally Sue's sister. Surely it was just a girl and boy friendship between Julia and Bill. A couple of university kids. The Crandalls lived across the street from Bill's fraternity house. \"Brown study. Mother?\" Bill asked after he had let Sally out. Margaret nodded. At least the child had made her think of someone besides Stephen. Her breath came unevenly. \"Let's get the trunks down before you leave,\" she said. I'll pack half the night, she told herself. I won't let myself think about Stephen. Jyr ARGARET hung the last curtain and stepped back to survey her living room with its deep-toned rug and baby grand piano. \"I don't know any one who can give a room the air of home-like luxury that you ? can,\" Stephen had once said. \"Don't forget I'm a home economics graduate. It's the artistic eye, plus plenty of polish and wax,\" she had laughed\" not realizing how much of the latter it took until she had to apply it herself after a busy morning at the Red Cross office. Not that she minded. She wanted to be working hard to be too tired every night to think. A shadow fell across the doorway. \"Hello, Mom,\" a plaintive voice said, \"got a handout?\" Margaret's eyes lit. She supposed Bill would always have the power to make her smile. He wasn't exactly good looking, but no one could call him homely either. Margaret loved the lean lankiness of him and the little gleam of humor in his eye. \"There are honey cookies in the old jar,\" she said. \"Gosh, Mom, it's swell to be back home.\" \"yYou don't miss the fraternity house too much then?\" \"I'm there plenty as it is. COURAGE IS THE WORD FOR IT 357 A fellow likes to know he's got a home,? Bill said, sitting down at the telephone. One would think he hadn't seen Julia all day, Margaret thought. Momentarily a frown crossed her brow. She must get better acquainted with Julia. \"How about my asking Julia to dinner tomorrow night?\" she asked when Bill hung up. \"Swell.\" Bill draped his long legs over the back of the sofa only to sit up again a little awkwardly. \"I don't know how to say it but you and Julia have just got to like each other.\" Margaret's face flushed crimson. \"I like Julia/ she said. \"Are you trying to say that she doesn't like me?\" \"Of course not. It's just that when you've got a swell mother and a swell girl, you want?\" Margaret felt a little prickly sensation at the back of her neck. Maybe she ought to talk to Julia. The kids musn't get too serious. They were so young. She'd talk to Bill, too, but not tonight. \"You can have Julia over all you want to now I have the house in order,\" she said instead. \"You know me. I like to have someone to keep house for/' Bill got to his feet, put his arm about her. \"No letter yet?\" he asked. \"No letter,\" she said, her voice unsteady. Stephen had been gone a month. It was hard not knowing, not being able to picture him in some particular place. ??# \"I didn't invite you to dinner to ask embarrassing questions, but when Bill was delayed it seemed a good chance for a chat.\" Margaret smiled at the young girl seated opposite her in the little room they called the study. \"I know you didn't,\" Julia said, and stopped. I have upset Julia, Margaret thought, and I didn't mean to. She had brought her in here because the close intimacy of the little room made it seem a place for confidences. The slanting rays of the sun caressed the red geraniums in the window, and made a pool of light at Julia's feet. \"Forgive me,\" Margaret said, and because she couldn't quite help it, \"You are beautiful, dear.\" Julia caught her breath on a half sob. \"I'm not going to pretend that I don't love Bill,\" she said, \"because I do. And,\" she added after a minute, \"he loves me. That's what you want to talk about, isn't it?\" Margaret bit her lip. Julia was refreshingly frank. She wondered whether it was the modern girl or just Julia. She was so sweetly serious yet full of fire and zip, sitting there in the big, blue chair. Her feet barely touched the floor, yet Margaret didn't think of her as little. Her face had the exquisite contour of a cameo, and her fine eyes were looking straight into Margaret's. \"It's because you are both so young, Julia dear,\" Margaret heard herself say. \"Bill and I don't want to be married for a long time.\" Julia's smile was wistful. \"I'd hoped you liked me just a little,\" she said, \"because I adore you. The lump came back into Margaret's throat. \"The girls have a stepmother,? Bill had said. \"She was an actress before she married their dad. They call her Cora. I think she's been more of a mother to Sally Sue than to Julia. If it hadn't been for her little sister, Julia would have been plenty lonesome at home since her father died.\" ?Thank you, dear.\" Margaret smiled at Julia. Bill was sensible really. He and Julia would be all right. There was Bill now. She loved the way he tossed those two unruly curls of his back on his forehead. \"Hello, Julia, hello. Mother,\" he was saying. \"Any mail?\" \"A letter from your dad,\" Margaret said. \"He's in the Philippines.\" Bill's eyes kindled. \"Gosh! That's where I'd like to be. Where's the letter?\" Margaret walked over to her desk, picked up the letter, put it down again. Stephen's first letter. She wanted to read it privately to Bill. \"I wish you knew my dad,\" Bill was saying. \"He's a darn swell guy. Never lets a fellow down.\" The sincerity in Bill's voice clutched at Margaret's heart. \"Here's the letter, dear,\" she said. \"I'll go finish up the dinner.\" She must get over feeling that Julia was an outsider. For her own sake and Bill's and Julia's, too, she must admit her into the inner sanctum of their home. ONCE you let the barriers down there is no putting them up again, Margaret realized as the weeks passed. She didn't want to be selfish, yet she would have liked to have had Bill to herself once in a while, at least. Just because he had been deferred was no reason he would continue to be. Nearly all his friends had gone already. But she crowded down the nagging worry. She didn't know just how long she would have Bill. She never let her thoughts go farther than that. They'll get tired of each other before long at this rate, she told herself one afternoon when Bill insisted on Julia's going down on the avenue with him to get his shoes shined. \"I can always get mine done, too,\" Julia called over her shoulder. Margaret sat down on a low stool beside the radio. She felt her nails pressing into her palms and deliberately folded her hands in her lap. She musn't be like that. Suddenly the music was over and a news analyst came on the air. \"The manpower problem in the army is serious,\" he said. \"Many deferments will not be renewed.\" Margaret felt the tears welling up behind her eyelids. What about Bill? It was time for his name to come before the draft board again. Maybe this time-She was crying when the door opened and Sally Sue burst in. \"Hello, Mrs. Jamison,\" she called, \"is Julie here? No one answered so I-\" \"Oh,\" she said, when she saw Margaret, \"I'm sorry. Cora says I'm always butting in where I have no business.\" Margaret dabbed at her eyes with the tight little ball that was her handkerchief. \"You musn't mind an old woman's tears, dear,\" she said, but her voice shook. Sally Sue stamped her foot. COURAGE IS THE WORD FOR IT 359 \"You're not old. You're young and pretty. Why don't you go on crying?\" She blushed furiously. ?I mean, don't mind me. I'll go away. Oh, here come Julia and Bill now.\" 'There was too much of a line up so we didn't wait.? Julia said. Margaret glanced at her quickly. Why that casual tone? She and Bill hadn't quarreled had they? Julia's face was flushed, her eyes too bright. Bill's, too. \"Oh hello, Sally,\" Julia was saying. 'Is anything the matter at home?\" \"Of course there isn't. I mean why should there be? Say, Julie, can I wear your white dress?\" \"Why, I don't know,\" Julia said doubtfully. \"Where are you go-ing?\" \"Oh, please, Julia, I have to,\" Sally pleaded. \"It's going to be a swell dance. I've got to knock their eyes out.\" \"Whose eyes?\" Bill laughed. Sally Sue looked at him pityingly. \"It's the Explorers. We are having a party at Mutual.\" She threw her arms around Julia's neck. \"Please Julie,\" she said. Margaret swallowed hard. Sally's chatter was giving her a chance to get hold of herself. \"Well, I suppose you can,\" Julia answered. \"When is the dance?\" \"A week from next Friday.\" \"Sort of forehanded aren't you?\" Bill teased. But Sally Sue wasn't listening. \"Oh, thank you, Julie,\" she beamed. \"I'll do something for you sometime.\" She turned to Margaret. \"Goodbye,\" she said. Margaret looked from Julia to Bill when the door closed after Sally Sue. \"What happened while you were gone?\" she asked, and in spite of herself her voice trembled. Bill shot a startied look at Julia. \"We stopped at the post office,\" he said, and pulled a long, official-looking envelope out of his pocket. \"Oh, Bill, your draft summons!\" For a moment the room reeled. Then it had four walls and a ceiling again, and Margaret heard what Bill was saying. \"Oh, Mom.\" There was exultation in his voice. \"Jeepers! I can't tell you how I feel. I've got to help. I've wanted to all. Along.\" Margaret put her hand up to her throat. She had had no idea. It didn't seem possible that Bill wanted to go. She looked at them and tried to overcome the sick feeling at the pit of her stomach. They were both so young and fine. So generous. Bill put one arm around her and one around Julia and it seemed to Margaret that he had grown an inch in the last few minutes. \"I've got to take it in my stride,\" she told herself, and rubbed her hand against Bill's cheek. \"I'm glad you feel the way you do,\" she said aloud. But no amount of remembering that she was a soldier's wife could reconcile Margaret to Bill's being in the army. She poured out her heart in a long letter to Stephen and then didn't send it. I musn't try to put my feelings into words, she thought. It isn't fair to Stephen. Instead she got out a V form. She couldn't say much on that, but it would be enough. In the days that followed, she could only think how young Bill was, how sheltered. How little responsibility he had ever been expected to take. It's a man's army. she told herself, and Bill is just a kid. ?They won't coddle me in the army.? Bill said gruffly one night. Margaret swallowed her tears. She must curb that longing to put her arms around Bill whenever he came home. \"Gosh, Mom, don't take it so hard,\" Bill was saying, ?I'm not a kid. Maybe I was, but I'm not now. Julie sees the difference.\" \"Aren't you spending too much time with Julie?\" Margaret asked and could have bitten her tongue out. \"No,\" Bill said. \"I'm not. Gosh, Mom, I'm going to be away from Julie. I'm going to be away from both of you.\" But it's harder to leave Julie, Margaret's swift thought finished. She musn't be like that. She musn't be jealous of Julia. \"I've got to tell you. Mom,\" Bill was saying, \"I passed my physical.\" \"Oh, Bill!\" Margaret knew she was hanging on desperately to her courage, but she musn't let Bill down. \"I'm glad,\" she said after a minute. Bill pushed back his hair and his young voice soared. \"Gosh, Mom, I'm in the army now.\" LONG before Margaret had time to get an answer from Stephen, Bill was gone. It seemed to her as if the army had opened and swallowed him up. Working all day at the Red Gross office and teaching nutrition three nights a week was important work she knew, but it left her with an aching void. On one particularly lonely evening, she wandered about the study. It had been Bill's playroom when he was a child. In the corner by the window she could still see a whole army of tin soldiers, and over by the radiator ran an electric train. She must see the big blue chair, not these things out of the past, but when she sat down in the chair, Stephen came to play on the floor with little Bill, and together they laid more track. Bill's high trebble mingling with Stephen's deep tones. Then they were gone, and Margaret heard nothing but the ticking of the clock. She didn't want to be sorry for herself. She wanted to make her contribution to the war as much as anyone. But she knew a lot of people whose homes weren't broken up. People who didn't have to look around and say, \"My home is entirely empty now that both my husband and my son are gone. There is no one to keep house for.\" The sharp ringing of the bell broke into her reverie. At the door a messenger handed her a special delivery letter. It was from Bill, and she opened it with one motion. \"Julie and I want to get married,\" he wrote without preamble. \"Julie will talk to you about it. Be an angel and persuade Gora to give her consent.\" Margaret sat staring at the letter, a little frown between her fine brows. They can't do that, she told herself. Hastily she put on a street dress. She'd go and see Gora at once. Together they'd nip this thing in the bud. Bill was just lonesome and homesick. He'd be all right a little later. Surely he and Julia had had no such idea when he went away. He musn't now, she told herself COURAGE IS THE WORD FOR IT 361 for the hundredth time when she rang the Crandall?s bell. Cora came to the door. \"How do you do, Mrs. Jamison?? she said in a low, contralto voice. \"Come over by the fireplace, won't you?\" Cora seated herself opposite her. In her red hostess coat that brought out the almost purple tint in her hair, Margaret couldn't help thinking that she was beautiful. But it was a studied pose she knew as was the huskiness in her voice. \"So the kids want to get married,\" she drawled. \"Well, I've told Julia she's much too young.\" \"They are both too young,\" Margaret said. \"Julie is nearly twenty,\" Cora said, \"but I think she'll realize that she has duties here at home.\" \"Maybe I can talk to her, too,\" Margaret said. It flitted through her mind that perhaps they had no right to interfere in the children's lives. But she put the thought aside. Bill and Julia would thank them for it later. \"You wouldn't conspire against me, would you?\" It was Julia. She came in with a little rush and put her arms around Margaret's neck. \"Bill and I want this so very much,\" she said. \"I'm sorry, dear,\" Margaret began, but Cora cut in crisply, \"Stop putting on an act. You don't know what you want.\" Julia's eyes struck fire. \"I do know,\" she said. \"I know I love Bill and I know he loves me. Margaret knows we meant to wait.\" Her young lips quivered. \"How do we know that there will be a tomorrow for us? Bill may not come back. We have to take our happiness when we can get it.\" Margaret drew her breath in sharply. It was so like the courage of youth to call a spade a spade. When you were older there were thoughts you crowded down, didn't let materialize. \"Bill said his mother would understand,\" Julia was saying. She was standing in front of Margaret now and her young breasts rose and fell stormily. \"I could get a job down there. We could have his week-end leaves together.\" \"I'm sorry, dear,\" Margaret began again. \"Why does everyone have to be like this? If Bill's old enough to fight, he's old enough to get married.\" The door slammed after Julia, and Margaret got slowly to her feet. At home she went disconsolately to bed. Dear Stephen, she thought, I need you to help me. She pulled the blankets more firmly about her, resting her head in the hollow of the pillow, but sleep wouldn't come. She hadn't realized how much she had depended on Stephen. Julia was so young, so tragic. Was Bill feeling the same way? Oh, Stephen, am I right? She breathed. Kok Ok I must stiffen my spine, she told herself the next morning,. Because I'm sure I'm right. Automatically she opened the morning paper. On the front page of the local news a picture caught her eye. It was Cora Crandall and under it the caption, \"Former Actress Joins Theatrical Troupe. Cora Bedford Crandall Will Tour Army Camps.\" Margaret sat staring at it. How can she leave Sally Sue? She thought. But of course she can if Julia is there. Relief flooded over her. That's what Cora meant about duties at home. It was going to work out. She wouldn't have to write to Bill and seem to interfere. But she had reckoned without her own warm heart. It was late afternoon when Julia came to see her. '1 don't know anyone to talk to but you,\" she said. She had the morning paper in her hand and her eyes were red. '1 can't go away and leave Sally Sue.\" Margaret stifled a quick desire to take Julia in her arms and comfort her. \"Cora is planning to leave,\" she heard herself say. \"Cora is just Cora. I'm Sally Sue's big sister.\" Julia's face worked. '1 shouldn't have made plans to go away.\" Margaret felt as if her heart were turning over. Here was someone strong and courageous, able to face life. Bill was courageous, too, doing a man's part. Suddenly she held out her arms to Julia. \"Do you think Sally Sue would be happy here with me?\" she asked. V.E. Day Observed PRESIDENT TRUMAN told the nation in a broadcast at 9 a.m. E. W. T., Tuesday, May 8, 1945, ?This is a solemn but a glorious hour. General Eisenhower informs me that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations. The flags of freedom fly over all Europe.\" This declaration brought some comfort and hope to the mothers of the United States; however, faced with the rising fury of a continuing ' war against Japan, no mother could fully rejoice in view of the cruel and heartrending days lying ahead. President Truman also set aside Sunday, May 13, as a day of national prayer, and said that it is eminently fitting that the day of prayer should also be Mother's Day. To the liberated countries of Europe and to the United Kingdom where the terrible ravages of war have been experienced, Victory-Europe Day meant a blessed deliverance from the acts of an oppressor; but to the citizens of our nation whose shores have been free from hostilities, V-E Day was only a day of observance to commemorate the end of one theatre of war?only a marker along the path of peace whose'end cannot yet be glimpsed by mortal eyes. In the heavy hearts of Latter-day Saints, too, is the sure knowledge that lasting peace will not abide on the earth until the nations, in reality and not merely in name, become Christian nations? until repentance, entering into the hearts of men, dictates the acts of nations. When that day dawns then indeed will it be a glorious day. M. C. S. LIVING SAFELY AT HOME Nellie O. Parker Former Member of Relief Society General Board Chairman Home Safety Division, Utah Safety Council HOME is quite generally considered the safest place in the world. \"Safe at home\" is an axiom in everyday usage. But, paradoxically, accidents which occur in the home, cause as many injuries as all other types of accidents combined, and home accidents cause more deaths than any other type of accident. These fatalities and injuries result in an enormous waste of life and limb, a staggering economic loss, and entail sorrow and suffering that never can be measured. They wreck savings and bank accounts; bring in their train poverty, hardship, and discomfort; and increase charity demands. Hospital beds are filled with such sufferers, and the care of nurses is required that is sorely needed for sick and wounded servicemen. According to the National Safety Council, in 1944 there were 30,500 persons killed in home accidents; there were 4,600,000 others injured, with a monetary cost of $550,000,000. Statistics for Utah for the same period show that every second day a home in Utah suffered the tragedy of an accidental death. Every month there were fifteen victims whose lives could have been saved by a little extra foresight, a little extra carefulness, a little extra attention to commonplace dangers in the home. No normal person wants to have an accident. His inborn instinct of self preservation and his desire to carry forward his plans and daily activities are thwarted when one occurs. It is important that every individual, especially a parent, be made conscious of the unsafe conditions that may exist in his home as well as habits of living which may produce accidents. Everyone should feel a personal responsibility to safeguard his life and those of others?especially little children. No little child should lose his life or become maimed or crippled if foresight and attention can prevent it. Little children need constant surveillance to see that they are getting sufficient air to prevent smothering, that they do not fall or get burned, etc. Everyone should learn to recognize a hazard in a loose fixture or frayed electric cord, a faulty furnace flue, or a pan of hot water set too near the edge of the stove; to foresee in a protruding nail, a dark cluttered stairway or an attic full of rubbish, a cause for an injury or a fire. And not only should he recognize the hazard but he should correct it. \"Safety,\" says the National Safety Council, \"is a rule for living for every individual, and it must be made a part of every human activity.? Page  Safety is efficiency, it is good housekeeping. It is intehigent to keep things in order, in their proper places and in good repair. It is safe, as well as good housekeeping, to keep grease, water or ice off the floor; to keep brooms, mops, etc., stored away in closets to prevent falls. Oily dustclothes should be kept in closed containers to avoid spontaneous combustion. Inflammable liquids, such as gasoline, should not be used for cleaning. This epitaph might apply to too many: Here lie the remains of Lizzie Green, She cleaned her dress in gasoline. Even though one may have performed a risky act without mishap once, it does not mean that luck will always be with him. It has been proved that an unsafe practice will eventually result in an accident. CHILDREN should be taught safe habits from babyhood?to eat or drink only those things given to them as food; to put their toys away; to climb only when it is safe; to avoid touching electric outlets or extension plugs. Sharp instruments such as knives, scissors, hatchets, etc., should be kept out of reach of children until they are old enough to handle them safely. If children, as well as adults, are trained in habits of safety, they can proceed to their daily activities without the lurking danger of an accident. Poisons should be kept out of reach and not in the bathroom medicine chest. They should also be marked in a distinctive way such as having a pin stuck in the cork. Old medicines should not be thrown into waste baskets where children might get them, nor should similar bottles be kept side by side, especially if one contains cough medicine and the other a benzoit compound for the croup kettle. Hurrying or quick, hasty movements are often the cause of bodily injury or death. If one feels anxiety, emotional stress or illness, the individual is often not as careful or alert to hazards as he normally would be. It is a safe practice, therefore, to avoid undue haste, to try to keep calm under all conditions, and to try to use common sense at all times. To prevent accidents should be a prime objective of everyone, but as human beings are prone to err, it is also important to know the fundamentals of first aid, and to have a working knowledge of home nurs; ing so that life may be saved if an accident does occur. The Accident Prevention course being given by the American Red Cross will prove helpful to the housewife who, because of her position in the home, can best be its safety engineer. It will help her to recognize unsafe conditions as well as unsafe practices in her own home. Strive to live safely at home by being prepared: first, to recognize or anticipate a hazard; second, to repair or eliminate the danger; third, to cultivate and form safe habits; and fourth, to keep a good first-aid kit close at hand. Daughters and Heirs Grace S. Cozzens CHRISTIE GLENN DAVIS sat at the head of the table, hostess to her three widowed sisters-in-law, all self-respecting widows, not a grass among them. The mirror, opposite Christie, reflected a slender, reddish-haired woman in a smoke-gray dress that matched her wistful eyes. For quite some time she had been planning this little dinner for just the four of them, in her apartment of carved woods and wrought iron. She felt little shooting pains of fear. Not that the meal would fail to please?. No, she hadn't forgotten that Ella was especially fond of baked ham, that Olive liked broiled squab, and that Amanda's favorite dessert was lemon pie. The meal was planned to please. To open the way. And she must watch for the right opening and take it when it came. She helped Ella to a serving of ham?Ella, that buxom girl of nineteen who had married Daniel twenty years ago. Dan, handsome, vital, had led Ella a dance, until Dad Glenn deeded him, his eldest son, a third of his perfectly cultivated ranch, and Dan had settled down to farming and fathering a family. Christie noticed Ella had grown older by eight or ten inches around the mid-section, though she still had the serene face of a madonna, with her soft gray eyes, and brown hair parted in the middle and knotted at the back of her neck. But her meek look belied her brisk, chuckle-filled speech. Ella owned that part of the farm next to the river. The old Bear River on which Christie had rowed, in which she had waded, by which she had picnicked when a child, and on whose sandbars she had lain full-length beside its warm, swashy waters?the old river with its never-ending theme story and song. A Swiss bronze clock on the mantel loosed a series of soft silvery chimes. \"How grand!\" Olive exclaimed. \"Oh, I'd give anything for a clock like that.\" \"Golly, yes!\" Ella chuckled. Across the table Christie was watching. Why couldn't it have been Amanda who admired the clock? It was Manda she wanted to bargain clocks with. But practical Manda said nothing. It naturally would be Olive?Olive exquisitely gowned in folds of georgette and lace, her flaxen, fluffy curls and red lips reminding one of a fancy figurine. Olive had been a brideybride, but had proved to be a tyrannical wife and a resentful widow, when Lee had succumbed to a sudden heart attack. She was a feverish sort. Always wanting things she couldn't have?never satisfied with things that were hers. Olive and her four children lived in the big ranch house, with its dozens of windows, six verandas, and many rooms and closets?all crowded with memories of the Glenn family. Page  Amanda, Jed's wife and the last to wear the widow's weeds, sat at the foot of the table. Hazel-eyed and thin, she was a little woman with a fighting chin. There was something solid and real about her. The auto crash that took Jed had left a little scar across, her cheek. She and Christie had gone to school together, and Amanda had often come to their house and played on the very spot of ground where Mandy's house now stood, surrounded by vast flower beds. Christie knew each rock and rill of it. Every nook where the Johnny-jump-ups and the wild bluebells came first in the spring. And the summits beyond that pierced the azure sky ?Christie knew every peak. ISN?T this the grandest meal?\" Ella chuckled. \"There's no such thing as beating Chris cooking.\" 'That's right,\" Amanda said in her thin, firm voice. \"Our grandmothers might have beat her piecing and spinning, but not cooking.\" Christie's heart skipped a beat. Here was an opening She rushed into it. \"Don't flatter me, giris,\" she smiled shyly. \"But speaking of spinning? whatever became of my grandmother's old spinning wheel? Dad left it up in the barn loft where you live, Olive. Is it still there?\" \"No-o,\" Olive drawled, accepting a cup of cocoa. \"After Lee died the kids got it down. They have it in their playhouse.\" 'Tlayhouse?\" Christie repeated. \"It's too frail, Olive. A long time ago my grandmother brought it across the ocean with her?and across the plains.\" \"That's none of my business,\" Olive laughed softly. \"But, Olive, its a keepsake. It's over a hundred years old.\" \"That's just it,\" Olive said. \"Who wants the old thing under her feet?\" She lifted her fork elegantly to her lips. \"A spoke or two are missing, but the girls still spin on it. And they have a good time.\" A frantic little horror rose in Christie's bosom. A spoke or two missing! There came to her, across the years, a picture of her little grandmother in her billowy skirts and lacy cap, sitting at the spinning wheel in the corner of the old log house on the Glenn farm, her small feet deftly treading. The wheel was whirling?fibers of wool twirling into yarn. And all the while the little old lady was telling the children stories of her long trip across the Atlantic. Two months, she'd told them, she and her three children had been in a sailboat with a few clothes and the old spinning wheel. \"That is,\" she had said, \"I left the old country with three, but I buried my baby in the ocean.\" She would tell them that their grandpa had died in Denmark, and that his last words to her had been: \"Sell everything and take the children to Utah.\" She had sold everything but the old spinning wheel. Christie's eyes grew bright. They met Olive's. \"Tell the girls,\" she said, appealingly, \"that Auntie will buy them any toys they choose, if they will let her have the spinning wheel.\" \"No,\" Olive said, without looking up from boning her squab. \"No. I wouldn't do that. It would be cheating you. And the girls are satisfied with it.\" They all began chatting pleasantly again. Christie couldn't believe she'd failed. She musn't fail. She must beg for it. DAUGHTERS AND HEIRS 367 \"Fd like so much to have it, Ohve/\" she said earnestly. 'T'll pay you well for it.\" \"Pay me for it?\" Olive laughed. \"Tou should see it. The old thing is about ready to drop to pieces. It's not worth anything.\" \"It is to me,\" Christie said. \"Well, the girls like it and I wouldn't ask them to part with it,\" Olive smiled lazily. \"For Ian' sakes, Chris, lay off!\" Ella giggled. Christie nodded. She musn't risk petty argument. It was understood, among all of them, that she had no rights about the farm where she had been born and reared, and where the three others now lived. The sons had inherited that. But if she could only make them somehow realize she was a part. Her underlying wishes did not represent a very great stake. There was a broader ?a more fundamental want... Now the sons and heirs were all gone... She passed the jam to Ella. \"Father gave his sword to Dan,\" she said. \"I wonder if you still have it, Ella?\" \"Yes. It's still sticking around.\" \"And has it ever been unsheathed?\" Christie asked. \"You know, dad said he never wanted it unsheathed.\" She smiled a little proudly. \"He said it with the grandeur and maje'y of an old soldier who had known the rigors of the battle field: \"That sword has never been thrust nor unsheathed since the day the* Yankees won. And I never want it misused.\"\" Christie looked directly at Ella. \"Has it been?\" \"Has it been?\" Ella laughed. \"Bob and Gil use it to fence with. Bob made a wooden one to go with it. You should see them parry and prime.\" Christie winced. \"Isn't a sword a pretty dangerous weapon for boys to fence with?\" \"Oh, no,\" Ella replied lightly. \"I made them break the point off.\" Christie jumped up and began clearing the table for the dessert. \"Would you mind selling me what is left of it?\" she asked abruptly. Ella's mouth curved into a possessive smile. \"You may as well cry for the moon, as to ask them to give it up. \"Do you think they would part with it for a brace of new foils?\" \"I'm afraid not,\" Ella answered. \"Besides, if it means that much to you, it means that much to me. Your dad gave that old saber to Dan and his boys are going to keep it.\" Again, Christie nodded. Another bit of hope crumpled. Her stormy gray eyes met Olive's cool blue eyes. \"Somewhere in the closet under the stairs in the old farmhouse, there is a powder horn, a bullet mold, and a couple of soldier caps with tiny brass guns crossed in front...\" \"They're all smashed to smithereens long ago,\" Olive said. Christie placed the dessert before her guests and refilled their glasses, while they chatted about things about the farm and their children. Her hands trembled. She sat down and braced herself for a last question, the last but by no means the least. She exchanged looks with Amanda. Then slowly she spoke. \"Manda, when the folks grew too old to manage the farm and turned it over to their sons and came to live with me, mother told me she left the family clock with Jed, since he was her oldest living child. You remember, it was of brown wood about a foot tall.\"\n\"Sure I remember it,\" Amanda nodded.\nChristie's voice lowered reminiscently. \"It had a rounded top, with a full glass door. On the lower half, a yellow pointer dog was painted in the center of a blue circle. . . .\"\n\"And the pendulum swung from the point of his nose to the tip of his tail,\" Amanda interrupted. \"We used to watch it when we were kids.\"\n\"Is it still there, Manda?\"\n\"Sure,\" Amanda said. \"But I haven't a shelf for it. Some day I'll get one and have the old ticker antiqued, and get a new hand for it and see if it will keep time.\"\n\"A new hand?\" Christie breathed out. \"What happened?\"\nAmanda tinkered with her water glass. \"One day I happened to set it on a chair and along came Sammy and picked off the minute hand. I could'a whipped 'im.\"\n\"Couldn't you have had it put back on?\"\n\"He broke it,\" Amanda scoffed. \"And I threw it in the garbage can.\"\nCHRISTIE'S attention slipped away from her guests. Once again through feverish eyes she was watching the minute hand. She was in her mother's big four-poster bed swathed in blankets in an attempt to break a fever. She was fretting and watching the big hand slowly count off the long minutes until the blankets could gradually be taken off. . . . Heat pricked at her temples. That old minute hand had chronicled every event of the Glenn family. It had recorded the births of the five babies. Timed their growth. Got them to school on time. Measured the long hours and the last moments to the heartbroken family around the death bed of little Jack, an early victim of appendicitis. It had marked the beginning of her wedding reception, and finally had pointed to the hour when she said goodbye to her family and the farm and had followed Dick, a young naval officer, on his uncharted course about the world. She'd lived in many a port and had remained in one place only during the time her parents had spent their last years with her. As from a distance, she saw her guests folding their napkins. Goose flesh crept over her like a rash.\n\"Amanda,\" she said a little huskily, \"now that Jed is gone, do you mind letting me have the family clock?\" She glanced at the mantel. \"I'll get you a new one, and save it all the way from Switzerland.\"\n\"Why should I?\" Amanda asked politely.\n\"Do you think it's too much for me to want the old family clock?\"\nAmanda's jaw set. \"I sure do. Your ma gave that clock to Jed, and it's never going to leave Jed's family.\"\nThere was a moment of oppressive silence, then the three widowed sisters-in-law began exchanging good-natured gibes among themselves.\n\"She's a good cook all right,\" Ella chuckled. \"But imagine the selfish gal trying to get our keepsakes away from us.\"\n\"Heirlooms,\" Christie countered. DAUGHTERS AND HEIRS \"Maybe I am selfish, since I have memories of them that none of you have. Maybe I did have my nerve asking?expecting?-since sons are heirs.\" The hour finally came when the guests began to take their leave. With a tired, let-down feeling, Christie escorted her kinswomen to the entrance hall to say goodbye. As they entered the sunroom a little red bird ran out from a rustic clock and mechanically \"cuckooed\" the hour of five. \"Oh, Chris!\" Olive cried with delight. \"Where in the world did you get it? I'd give anything for a clock like that.\" Christie looked bewildered. \"Even the old spinning wheel?\" \"Even the old spinning wheel!\" Olive exulted. \"The kids would be crazy over it.\" Christie quietly placed the cuckoo clock in Olive's out-stretched hands. Amanda pursed her thin lips. \"That's not fair,\" she shrugged, \"giving Olive a gift from your swell apartment, and not us.\" Olive held the clock proudly. \"Thanks, Chris,\" she shrilled. Christie looked at Amanda. \"Name your gift,\" she said softly. Amanda scanned the room warily. Christie hinted, \"How about the pair of love birds in the gilded cage? \"The what?\" Amanda raised a skeptical brow. Christie pointed toward the window. \"See,\" she said, \"the darling little blue and green love birds.\" Amanda frowned. \"Oh, no,\" she scoffed. \"Our old cottonwood trees are full of squawking birds. 369 But, that gorgeous fuchsia with the red and purple bells?\" \"Yours for the asking,\" Christie interrupted. Her hands were a little unsteady as she held the potted plant toward Manda. Amanda took it gingerly. \"I guess you'll want the old clock in its place,\" she said. Christie nodded. Amanda laid her cheek against a bloom. \"Well, that suits me all right.\" Ella drew herself as erect as her chubby legs would allow. \"Lan' sakes,\" she sighed, \"what do I get? The boys will take a duck-fit when you two march in with your gifts from Chris, after her trips around the world.\" \"What are you waiting for, Sis?\" Christie smiled. \"Choose!\" Mia laughed softly. \"I'm too decent a person to mention what I?d like.\" Her eager glance shot across the room, touching a miniature aquarium. \"But, I?m all wound up over?well, I won't say, but I know the boys'd trade the old saber in a minute.\" With quiet grimness, Christie handed the fish bow] to Ella. \"Relax,\" she smiled. \"Oh, Chris, how did you ever guess?\" she gasped. \"What are they, anyway? You must tell me how to feed them.\" \"They are guppies,\" Christie said, \"and here are the foods and directions in full for their care.\" \"Goopies,\" Ella repeated, caressing the bowl. In the vanishing daylight Christie sat alone. \"Bless 'em,\" she murmured as she watched the car with (Concluded on page 372) Sand-Pile Advantages Alice Whitson Norton MRS. BARKER, standing at the kitchen door overlooking her neighbor's back yard, frowned when she saw a small truck back up and dump a load of sand in Betty Jane's old sand pit. She could think of ever so many other things that would be far more delightful for her own little child than a sand pile. All the morning as she went about her household tasks, she kept thinking about the big load of sand in her neighbor's back yard, and finally, when Mrs. Draper came running in to borrow a cup of sugar, she turned upon her in surprise. \"I?ve been wondering all the morning,\" she said frankly, \"just why you had all that sand piled in the back yard.\" \"There's only one excuse for a sand pile,\" laughed Mrs. Draper. \"The children in the neighborhood like it.\" \"To me, that's just the trouble. It's like a bread crumb dropped near an ant hill.\" \"You mean it brings all the children running to it?\" asked Mrs. Draper. \"Exactly,\" returned Mrs. Barker. \"And that's where the rub comes in.\" \"That's altogether in the way you view it.\" \"What do you mean?\" Mrs. Barker asked thoughtfully. \"I mean,\" Mrs. Draper answered, \"that a sand pile furnishes not only healthy amusement, but encourages industry and unselfishness. Now take my child, for instance. Page 370 Betty Jane has practically everything she wants, hence the tendency to develop selfishness could easily be hers. So I fill the sand box with sand, then to that I add blocks of various sizes, nails, small hammers, trowels and small shovels, and a few pieces of screening and tin, and instruct Betty Jane to divide these things among her playmates when they come to play, and to respect the corners given them. In this way she learns to make use of a few things and the joy of sharing, besides. Many a successful builder, architect, and engineer has found his talent in a sand pile.\" After this little lecture, Mrs. Draper reached for the cup of sugar and turned to go home. \"I forgot to tell you,\" she called back over her shoulder, \"I needed this sugar to sweeten some cookies I'm stirring up for the children.\" Mrs. Barker glanced out at the sand pile where busiest among the young engineering group was her own young son, industriously cutting a channel diagonally across the plot allotted him. \"Funny,\" she mused, \"how some people can see so much in a sand pile while others see nothing.\" And then she lifted her hand and tapped lightly on the windowpane, a signal the two neighbors used in calling to each other. Mrs. SAND-PILE ADVANTAGES 371 Instantly Mrs. Draper's bright face was peeping through the glass. \"I'm making lemonade,\" Barker called pleasantly, \"to go with her neighbor had caught a glimpse those cookies?sort of a celebration of the vision she had, went back to in honor of the sand pile.\" the job of cookie-making with a And Mrs. Draper, feeling at last happy smile on her face. The 115th Annual General Conference (Continued from page 329) or intellectual matters, but we do have the invincible truth. Civilization is not wealth or numbers. It is the appreciation of human brotherhood and the. Ceaseless pursuit of real justice. War is the outward sign of inner spiritual decay. Give tireless watch-care to our boys. When they are around, they may be a \"pain in the neck,\" but when they are gone, they are a pain in the heart. Nothing has strengthened my faith more than seeing the gospel in action in the lives of our men in the service. Chastity strengthens man. It is the source of peace and happiness in the home. I like to think of life as beginning before mortality and enduring beyond death. Don't substitute money for welfare assignments. Hungry saints in Europe can't eat money earmarked sugar or beef. They need real sugar, beef, cheese, flour, and butter. I could not believe in a God who would be so unjust as to punish those who die without knowledge of his teachings. We must gain light and truth to go on toward Godhood. Those who oppose profitable evil or popular fallacy are always misunderstood. I know that Christ founded his Church in this day through his prophet. If we come to the Lord with contrite hearts and humble spirits, we cannot fail. The Church of Christ is great in purpose, in leadership, and in historical background. Probably no section hand in the United States but thinks he could run the railroad better than its president. Some inexperienced people, too, think they could guide the Church. While not accountable for things we cannot know, we are held for ignorance which but for sloth might have been dispelled.. Oh, that people had a fraction of the faith in the prophets that they have in the doctors. Whoever receives or rejects the living servants of the Lord receives or rejects the Lord. It is in adversity and sorrow the spirit grows strongest. The gospel teaches me that I am a son of God and a brother of Jesus Christ and therefore of most noble ancestry.

You stick up for your rights.\" She went slowly out of the room, leaving the door ajar, and Delsa thought. It doesn't matter. I can't sleep anyway. All I can do is lie here and think of Hugh and of what I can never have.\" She turned her head on the pillow and the tears came softly and silently from under her closed lids and drenched the white case. And Delsa didn't know when sleep came and dried her tears and stopped the endless, futile questioning of her heart. (To he continued) We'll Live Those Days Again (Continued from page 337) as they were held and just where they were held, in 1847. Nearby residents in all sections will be invited to participate. Then, too, there will be the arrival, at the mouth of Emigration canyon. Salt Lake City, of this momentous caravan, on the exact day ?100 years later ?when the original pioneers arrived. There will be other events, too, but, like the rest, plans for them must be held in abeyance?or in reserve. They may be used only if they are possible under war conditions. But a program is being worked out. What it will be is not yet known. It will be appropriate, however, for the glory of the occasion. It will live up to the traditions of Utah, as far as is possible, and will direct national attention to the State's most important event?the Centennial of its discovery and settlement by Brigham Young and the original pioneers. Among the plans tentatively made are: Issuance by the U. S. Government of a Utah Centennial stamp for nation-wide distribution. Approval and issuance by the U. S. Government for permits for a Utah Centennial cachet. Approval by the U. S. Government of a cancellation stamp telling of the Utah Centennial. Recital of incidents in Utah history through national magazines and newspaper syndicates. Development of Utah's cultural activities; such as dramas, pageants, and other enterprises. Development of Utah's scenic, recreational, vacation and sports possibilities through the promotion of events to attract national publicity. Development of national publicity for the State. Depending upon conditions, some of these plans may be fully realized, and others developed to a lesser degree; but as war conditions permit, the Utah Centennial will be celebrated to its fullest possible extent.

Flag Etiquette Excerpts from Public Law 829?77th Congress Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States oi America in Congress Assembled'... That the following codification of existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use of the flag of the United States of America be, and it is hereby, established for the use of such civilians or civilian groups or organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations promulgated by one or more executive departments of the Government of the United States.... Sec. 2. (e) The flag should be displayed daily weather permitting, on or near the main administration building of every public institution.... Sec. 3. (g) When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another in time of peace.... (1) When the flag is displayed otherwise than by being flown from a staff, it should be displayed flat, whether indoors or out, or so suspended that its folds fall as free as though the flag were staffed.... (k) When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, if it is displayed in the chancel of a church, or on the speaker's platform in a public auditorium, the flag should occupy the position of honor and be placed at the clergyman's or speaker's right as he faces the congregation or audience. Any other flag so displayed in the chancel or on the platform should be placed at the clergyman's or speaker's left as he faces the congregation or audience. But when the flag is displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium elsewhere than in the chancel or on the platform it shall be placed in the position of honor at the right of the congregation or audience as they face the chancel or platform. Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the congregation or audience as they face the chancel or platform.... Sec. 4- (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise. (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free. (d) The flag should never be used as drapery of any sort whatsoever, never festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of a platform, and for decoration in general. (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as will permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way. Page 373 (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling. (g) The flag should never have placed upon it' nor on any part of it* nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature. (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything. (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard; or used as any portion of a costume or athletic uniform. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown. (j) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning. Sec. 5. That during the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag, stand at attention, and salute. Those present in uniform should render the military salute. When not in uniform, men should remove the headdress with the right hand holding it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Men without hats should salute in the same manner. Aliens should stand at attention. Women should salute by placing the right hand over the heart. The salute to the flag in the moving column should be rendered at the moment the flag passes. Sec 6. That when the national anthem is played and the flag is not displayed, all present should stand and face toward the music. Those in uniform should salute at the first note of the anthem, retaining this position until the last note. All others should stand at attention, men removing the headdress. When the flag is displayed, all present should face the flag and salute. Sec. 7. That the pledge of allegiance to the flag, \"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,\" be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart. However, civilians will always show full respect to the flag when the pledge is given by merely standing at attention, men removing the headdress. Persons in uniform shall render the military salute.... BOUND VOLUMES THOSE desiring to have their 1944 issues of Thebound, may do so through the office of the General Board.

RELIEF SOCIETY AND CHURCH WELFARE SEWING Bear River Stake (Utah) MAUDE O. COOK, president of this stake Relef Society, wrote in July 1944: \"We have completed and sent to the Northern Utah Region 17 layettes, 162 boys' shirts, 23 ladies' dresses and housecoats, 24 children's dresses, 33 ladies' aprons, 33 panties, 274 dish towels, 120 hand-hemmed handkerchiefs, 155 pillow slips, 13 sheets, and we have on hand finished or partly so 33 women's nightgowns, 19 ladies' slips, 13 pairs of men's pajamas, and 50 pillowslips. Accompanying is a photo of the Tremonton Second Ward Relief Society work meeting held the second Tuesday of June. The meeting began at 9 a. M. And continued until 5 P. M.; dinner was served at noon. Eighty-three women were present. They made 28 women's nightgowns for the welfare project, and for the ward a number of aprons for a contemplated bazaar, finished 2 layettes, 2 quilts, and a number of dish towels, and cut and sewed 20 pounds of rags for rugs. A similar meeting was held by the Garland Relief Society during the month of May at which 60 women were present.\" All-day work meeting held June 13, 1944, by the Tremonton Second Ward, Bear River Stake.

In the picture are the stake Relief Society executive officers under whose direction this assignment was filled; left to right: Lorena W. Anderson, then counselor in charge of work and now president; Amy B. Towler, retiring president; Leone G. Layton, counselor who in June had been appointed to the General Board of Relief Society; and Cacia Margetts, secretary-treasurer, retained by the new president. Picture of another part of this stake's assignment appeared in the Magazine for March 1945, page 130, as an illustration for the article \"The Relief Society in Church Welfare\" by Elder Marion G. Romney, Assistant Managing Director of the General Church Welfare Committee. Wells Stake (Utah) LORENA W. ANDERSON, president of Wells Stake Relief Society, wrote last July of the 1944 welfare sewing assignment which was completed while she was serving as counselor in charge of work, under direction of Amy B. Towler, then president. \"When we received this assignment it seemed almost an impossibility to fill it under war conditions. We considered it a very large order, but we divided it and gave each one of our eight wards an equal amount. Our loyal, faithful ward presidents accepted their quota in the proper spirit, and with their Relief Society members soon were busy and very interested. 'The layettes were daintily handmade, trimmed with silk crochet edgings, laces, and buttons which could not be purchased today but which were furnished by the sisters. Our children's dresses were an expression of individual style and trim, which made them very attractive. Our misses' and women's dresses were also individually patterned and well made. All our purchased materials were as good as the market affords today, including sheets, pillow cases, and dish towels. \"In unity there is strength. Our sisters were united and willing to work many extra days, and did so with a spirit of love and co-operation, with the feeling that 'it is better to give than to receive.? NOTES FROM THE FIELD 377 A few of the 1200 coats and jackets for boys and girls being made from used coats by the Relief Societies of the Northern Utah Region as a part of the 1945 clothing assignment of the Church Welfare Program. This project is under direction of Reka Parker, chairman of the women's work directors of this Region and counselor in charge of work in the South Ogden Stake Relief Society. In the picture are Orval Dean, Regional Coordinator, and Pearl McArthur who receives the finished clothing at the storehouse.  Never before in our stake has there been greater enthusiasm for the work meeting. This we attribute to the joy the women have received in contributing to the great Church Welfare Program.\" Northern Utah Region (Ogden) REKA PARKER, chairman of the women's work directors of this Church Welfare region, and counselor in charge of work in the South Ogden Stake Relief Society, reported April 1, 1945: \"One of the 1945 Church Welfare clothing assignments for the Northern Utah Region is the making of 1200 coats and jackets from old used coats. 'The used coats are procured from the Deseret Industries in Ogden and Salt Lake City. Women from the Region carefully examine and select the coats to be used. The coats are cleaned at the Deseret Industries, and upon their return are sorted again according to sizes and styles, counted, and distributed to the stakes and wards for ripping apart and pressing, ready for cutting. In the Northern Utah Region there are 15 stakes with 128 wards, so the coats are distributed in proportion to the assignment of each stake which is governed by its population. \"Uniform styles and patterns have been selected for boys' and girls' coats and jackets, and each stake is assigned a large and a small size to make for either a boy or a girl. Victory quilt of red, white, and blue percale, made by Sadie Jones, chairman of the quilting committee in the Provo First Ward Relief Society, Provo Stake. (Picture submitted by Inez B. Allred, president of Provo Stake Relief Society.) \"Brother John Christiansen, a well-known tailor with 37 years of experience, kindly consented to give some demonstrations and a set of simplified instructions on the cutting and making of melton jackets to the stake Relief Society women's work directors. Later on. Brother Christiansen gave a demonstration on the lining and padding of coats for girls. Two demonstrations have been held, attended by Relief Society women from the distant Lyman and Woodruff stakes as well as the other stakes of the Region. One little woman waited in a bus depot until 3 A. M. Rather than leave by an earlier bus before the demonstration was over. Two other women were given beds in the storehouse so that they might remain to see all of the demonstration. \"These stake leaders in turn held like demonstrations for their ward women's work directors. The ward leaders were asked to instruct accordingly the women who did the cutting and sewing. Written instructions have been prepared by Louisa T. Scoffield, counselor in the Weber Stake Relief Society, and two copies given to every ward women's work director in the Region. \"Seven hundred of these coats are now distributed. Many are finished and the rest in preparation for cutting and sewing. Women have taken many of the light-colored ones home, ripped them apart and laundered them in mild soap flakes, which has greatly improved their appearance. \"All buttons, linings, and inter-linings are saved and used again if possible. Binding tape, thread, and some new linings are furnished by the Regional Welfare Committee.\" NOTES FROM THE FIELD 379 The stake Relief Society presidency and women of the Springdale Ward taking their turn at the lovely new sewing room on the second floor of the Burley Stake storehouse. Agnes C. Hoggan, stake Relief Society president, reports that this sewing room was completed last August and has been in operation since then. A ward is assigned to sew here each Friday afternoon, cleaning, renovating, and remodeling used clothing.

At the left are Counselors Margaret Hansen and Norma Johnson; President Naomi Ruud, center; and Secretary Treasurer Thora Rawson, right. Boise Stake (Idaho) OFFICERS of the Boise First Ward Relief Society submitted the following account of their very successful bazaar: \"The Relief Society bazaar of the Boise First Ward was held December 7, 1944 in the ward recreation hall with much enthusiasm and success. Eight months previous, at the April work meeting, the members unanimously voted in favor of having an outstanding event sometime in the late fall and they co-operated wholeheartedly toward this end during the several months of preparation. Committees were appointed by the executives for the following booths: Art work?which included a display of pillow cases, luncheon sets, tea towels, crocheted articles, etc. Apron?Over one hundred aprons were made by the members for this booth. Baby?'This booth consisted of articles for baby layette, including two satin quilts. Children's pajamas and dresses, stuffed animals and dolls were also on display. Quilt?Twelve quilts were made by the quilt committee, including two beautiful satin quilts. Cake?Fifty cakes were donated and sold at this booth. Candy?One hundred and twenty pounds of candy were made by a special candy committee. The sugar was donated in small quantities by the sisters of the ward. \"Chili was sold at the end of the evening after a floor show presented by the dancing school was enjoyed by the 800 people in attendance. \"Articles and materials were NOTES FROM THE FIELD 381 purchased by the Society and were made up by the members. \"Proceeds from the sale of the many fine articles on display amounted to approximately $700.\" Ensign Stake (Utah) LEONE O. JACOBS, counselor in the Ensign Stake Relief Society, of which Alice B. Steinicke is president, wrote in November 1944: \"For several years since the division of the ward, the South 18th Ward Relief Society had been in need of additional storage space. One small closet was the only available nook for the numerous and varied supplies. During 1942, first-aid kits and emergency supplies were required to be on hand in every ward, in case of disaster. In 1943 came the Church Welfare bedding project which called for huge bundles of cotton and wool batts, more quilt frames, and materials. Confusion and disorder reigned in the closet. It was impossible to know where each article was and to keep it accessible. If quilt blocks, for example, were wanted, it might take half an hour fumbling through piles of materials, stepping over sewing machines and other equipment, to find them. \"The Bishop was consulted and he and the Relief Society presidency (Sisters Zilpha Bramwell, Lorene Chamberlain, and Agnes Manookin) toured the rooms and hallways adjacent to Relief Society quarters with a view to adding another closet. Several places were discussed and rejected because of price or unsuitability. Vilate R. Ivins, secretary of the South 20th Ward Relief Society, Ensign Stake, is shown at the cupboard which she had built in the Relief Society room as a memorial to her mother, Emma P. Romney, now passed away, who had served as a president of the old Twentieth Ward Relief Society. Picture taken in 1944. Sister Ivins says: \"The cupboard is 8 1/2 feet high, 16 feet long, and 22 inches deep. It has 103 feet of shelf space, 20 inches deep. The long shelves are 11 inches apart. We were told not to put the shelves too far apart. It is better to have more shelves than to overload them. \"The cupboard adds to the beauty of the room. The room is also used as a banquet room so the Bishop was fearful at first that it might be in the way, but it is not. After two years of use, we find it is adequate in every detail.\" Storage Cupboards, South 18th Ward Relief Society, Ensign Stake. Inset shows lid to upper section where quilt frames and first-aid splints and stretchers are stored. Finally, Sister Chamberlain, welfare counselor, conceived the idea of building cabinets under the windows along the east wall of the Relief Society room. The windows are high above the floor. This suggestion seemed very practical and everyone agreed to it. Plans were drawn and not many weeks passed before the cupboards were completed. Not only do they adequately solve the storage problem, but they add charm and individuality to the room. The maple finish of the cabinets matches the woodwork, showing the beautiful grain of the wood. \"Not being sure that one width of the room would allow sufficient space, the cabinet was extended part way down the south wall. The top of the cabinet opens up with a lid and here are placed horizontally the quilt frames, also splints and stretchers for first-aid kit. Below are shelves and drawers to meet every demand. Attractive window curtains come just to the top of the cabinet, and potted plants, spaced at intervals, add to the general effect of the room. Such a pleasing arrangement could be adopted by other ward Relief Societies.\" SPECIAL ACTIVITIES North Sanpete Stake (Utah) wrote in October 1944: PEARLE M. OLSEN, president of this stake Relief Society wrote in October 1944: \"For about eight years this stake of has maintained a library department. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 383 Each year seven or eight new books were added and the total circulated about among the wards of the stake. Best sellers in biography, fiction, and philosophy, constituted the library. Much good has been derived by the women of our stake from this source of reading material. A year ago we decided to expand our library and made arrangements with the bishop of Mt. Pleasant South Ward for use of a little-used room in the chapel. My husband built us several sections of open bookshelves, all movable, allowing for easy cleaning and rearrangement. Several members of the stake board cleaned the room and stained and varnished the shelves. We procured a used desk and got permission from the ward Relief Society to use a few extra chairs they had. Then we made a call for suitable books and combined those received with those we already had accumulated. We added some new ones, mostly of a theological nature, and some of the finer books of fiction, and biography. Through the years some books were lost, but at the present time we have around 150 volumes on our shelves. Included is a set of the Documentary History 01 the Church? by the Prophet Joseph Smith. There are also eight bound volumes of TheOne of our sisters contributed Magazines her mother had saved through the years, dating back to 1915, and we will have these bound. \"We have found that there is a strong preference among the women of the stake for the books of a spiritual nature. Each ward has a librarian who handles the exchange of books for her ward each month when she attends stake leadership meeting, taking back to her ward those books for which the sisters have expressed preference. Last year we adopted a slogan, 'Reading as a Morale Builder.' It has been a joy to see the high type of reading ?a very great percentage the works of our Church writers?toward which our women incline. \"Our library has great possibilities as a study room and source of information in our educational departments. It will take time to build it carefully toward our goal, but we are convinced it can and will be done.\" Maricopa Stake (Arizona) IRENE A. DUKE, stake Relief Society secretary, reports: ?The Maricopa Stake Relief Society sponsored a special testimony meeting for all women of the stake on Sunday, December 31, 1944, from 2 to 3:30 p. M. In the Mesa Second Ward chapel. \"Sister Ella Bentley played soft organ music as over two hundred women assembled to worship. A poem 'Home' was read by First Counselor Vida D. Brinton. President Irene L. Brown gave a brief address of welcome and bore her testimony. Seventeen women related inspirational testimonies of faith and courage, healings and answers to prayers, expressing hope and faith in the future despite the present war-torn world. \"At intervals, choice musical selections were rendered, including organ solos by Ella Bentley, ladies' trio from Tempe Ward, a Singing Mothers? chorus from Gilbert Ward, and a ladies' chorus from Mesa Fourth Ward. \"This inspirational meeting brought solace and renewed courage to the women of this stake.\" Members of the Downey Ward Relief Society, Portneuf Stake, with the 52 Christmas boxes they packed early last October for overseas shipment to servicemen from Downey Ward. They observed a minute of silent prayer before packing the boxes. On November 21, they packed boxes for the boys stationed in the United States. Helen Hyde is president of this ward Relief Society.

Grant Elder Bryant S. Hinckley SURROUNDED by his family and immediate associates President Heber J. Grant passed peacefully away at his home on Eighth Avenue, Salt Lake City, at 6:55 P.M., May 14. Thus ended one of the most remarkable careers in the history of this people.\nWhile in California, five years ago, the President suffered a severe stroke which paralyzed his left side. He rallied from this stroke but never completely recovered the use of his leg or arm. This made it difficult for him to get around and impaired his health, but he has been able to sign letters and pass upon important matters up to within less than a week of the last.\nThis coming November he would have been eighty-nine years of age. He carried the weight of many years cheerfully and courageously. His career has been a long and marvelous one. While his life was an open book, it required an intimate contact with him to appreciate the finer qualities of his nature, to understand the nobility of his character, the greatness of his heart, the tenderness and generosity of his shining soul.\nLiterally thousands of people have been the recipients of his favors, of gifts and remembrances which have greatly endeared him to their hearts. No other man of his means has been more generous to widows, to orphans, to those overtaken with misfortune or sorrow. He has gone! What a cloud of witnesses will rise up and bless his memory forever.\nHis life has been a record of service to others. He was strikingly unselfish, pure in heart, sincere and lofty in purpose, constant in his loyalty to his friends, his country and his Creator. All of his endowments, and they were of a most superior order, were imbedded in a deep spirituality which gave direction and effectiveness to the dynamic energy which was so characteristic of him.\nHis life was a delightful definition of true religion. He was cultured in mind, refined in manner, ripened in judgment, fraught in spirit, inherently honest and transparently frank. He had that nobility of soul, that generosity of spirit, that greatheartedness that distinguishes one truly great. The story of his youthful achievements will never dim. They will endure for all time as noble traditions among this people. His name will shine forever as an example of the sterling virtues of industry, patience, and perseverance. Whether playing baseball, mastering penmanship, helping banks or building sugar factories he achieved his end. Page  RACHEL RIDGEWAY IVINS GRANT AND HER SON HEBER This picture was taken on the ninth birthday of President Grant. His life covered a long span of eventful years. Ox teams and covered wagons were familiar in the streets of Salt Lake when he was a boy. The Pony Express, the telegraph, the railroad, the high-powered motor car, the radio, the airplane all came in his day and he kept step with the great march of human progress. The generation of men with whom he started has gone   they will greet him joyfully on the other side. He was a friend maker. In all parts of the world he won the warm and enduring friendship of eminent men. The greatest tribute ever paid to a living citizen of Utah was paid to President Grant on his 82d by five hundred of the leading men of this State, and this was a spontaneous expression of esteem and affection for the President as a great citizen. PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 325 PRESIDENT AND SISTER HEBER J. GRANT birthday He was a great son of a great mother. The memory of his mother glowed in his soul and gladdened his life to the end of his days. He paid this tribute to her: \"I live today in the eightieth year of my life as one whose mother was all to me. She set an example of integrity, of devotion and love, and of determination and honor second to none. Her life was a sermon that rings through my soul to this day. One of the main reasons I am President of the Church today is that I have followed the advice and counsel and the burning testimony of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ, which came to me from my mother.\" His wife, Augusta Winters Grant, who survives him, possesses the same unruffled serenity that the President's mother possessed. She is a brilliant and cultured woman who has in every way sustained her distinguished husband whose devotion to her was beautiful. President Grant was a great leader of a great cause a prophet inspired of Heaven who taught by example, who practiced first and then preached, who led the way and the people cheerfully followed. Permeating his words and motivating his actions was a zeal for the truth, a love for God and humanity. He lived long, abundantly, purposefully devoting his great energies to exalted ends, and died peacefully. It is hard to think of him in the past. The world seems lonely without him. We believed in him, enjoyed him, loved him, and we shall cherish his memory forever. I have urged upon the people, and have been called a crank for so doing, the observance of the Word of Wisdom and I expect to continue to be a crank in that respect to the end of my life. Lam converted beyond the shadow of a doubt that no man or woman in this Church who does not observe the Word of Wisdom can grow and increase in a knowledge and testimony of the gospel as he or she could otherwise do. President Heber J. Grant, June 25, 1932. I will ask no man to be more liberal with his means according to his ability, for the upbuilding of the Church, than I myself shall be; I will ask no man to be more strict in the observance of the Word of Wisdom than I am willing to be; I will ask no man to be more conscientious and prompt in the payment of his tithes and offerings than myself; I will ask no man to be more ready and willing to come early and go late and to give more of his time and talents to the work of the Lord than I am willing to do and to give.  President Heber J. Grant, 89th Annual General Conference, June 1919."

If President Heber J. Grant, sitting in his nearby home with a special wire carrying the proceedings to him, could be reckoned as being there, and every man in the conference felt very close to him, then the general authorities could be counted as being all present. The weather was favorable. Spring gave three beautiful days and relapsed into winter only after the conference was over. This gathering represented the largest membership the Church has had. Nearly a million persons (954,004) are on its books. The rapid growth is understood when we take into account the conversions (5,493) and the astonishing ratio of births to deaths (5.65 to 1). During 1944, the Church distributed in missionary work, allowances to stakes and wards, welfare, education, maintenance and renovation of buildings, genealogical and other work ($8,270,653).

            "content": "Milton R. Hunter were sustained. Brother Young is a grandson of President Seymour B. Young, who for many years was senior president of the Council, and a great-grandson of President Brigham Young. Both of the new presidents have spent their mature lives in guiding youth. To the readers of this Magazine a most interesting event was the change in the presidency of the Relief Society, treated fully in the May issue. Sister Amy Brown Lyman, eighth president, completes her faithful service, and Sister Belle S. Spafford, the ninth, takes over. What beautiful examples of womanhood the heads of this great institution have been. The outstanding event of the proceedings was unquestionably the message of President Grant. It was characteristic in language and content, and in the intensity of his admonition to faith and righteousness. As always his heart is tender for the young and their problems. He said: I wish to impress upon the workers in all the organizations of the Church, the need for laboring prayerfully, untiringly, and diligently at this time to persuade the youth of Zion to be more faithful, more diligent in all their obligations and responsibilities, in safeguarding their virtue, and in observing what is known as the Word of Wisdom. Especially is the President solicitous for those in the armed service: Page  Our hearts, our thoughts, and our prayers go out to those who are in the armed forces. It would appear from all the figures we can gather, that more than one hundred thousand of our young men arc in the service of their country, in uniform. We pray for them continually. We pray for the preservation of their lives and for their faithfulness to those things which are dearer than life.... Young men of Zion, when you return to your homes, return with clean hands and clean hearts and great will be your happiness, your faith, and your testimony. Your brethren and your loved ones cherish you, pray for you, and await the day of your coming. And I pray with all my heart that if there are those who have made mistakes, that they will repent; and by this we may know that they have repented that they will confess their sins and depart from them. What the President called his keynote, and it has certainly been the keynote of his life, is given in the following stirring plea: There is but one path of safety to the Latter-day Saints, and that is the path of duty. It is not a testimony only; it is not marvelous manifestations; it is not knowing that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true, that it is the plan of salvation it is not actually knowing that the Savior is the Redeemer, and that Joseph Smith was his prophet that will save you and me; but it is the keeping of the commandments of God, living the life of a Latter-day Saint. I pray constantly for all the officers of this Church, whether in the priesthood or in the auxiliary associations. I am sure, in my secret prayers particularly, that I never forget, morning or night, those that have been called to preside, to direct the affairs in the priesthood quorums and in the auxiliary associations. My prayer is that each of you holding a place of responsibility shall so order your lives that they shall be examples of diligence and energy and of the Spirit of the Living God, that can be followed in every part by those over whom you preside. If we do this, what a wonderful power we shall have with the Lord in the furtherance of his mighty purposes in the earth. If we keep his commandments, our influence will be not only with the world, but with our own young people. Their strength and power will be multiplied if we shall succeed in having them feel the necessity of observing the commandments of God, particularly concerning the principles of clean and righteous living. I say to all Latter-day Saints: Keep the commandments of God. That is my keynote just these few words: Keep the Commandments of God/ President Clark conducted the conference, and his brief and sound commentaries on the proceedings at a number of the sessions were impressive and timely. Foreseeing, as lie does, the time when food will be needed by the people, he spoke earnestly of a matter that is dear to his heart: The Welfare Plan, which I once more repeat is not the United Order, but is motivated by the same lofty and divine principles and purposes that underlay the Order, has now been in operation nine years. Through the blessings of the Lord and the faithfulness of the people, it has steadily grown and expanded its activities during the whole period, and it stands today stronger than ever before in its operation. Its opponents have not destroyed and cannot destroy it, so long as the Lord blesses it and faithful members support it... However, if you refuse to aid, if you refuse to receive the blessings of joy and satisfaction which come from treading along the ways the Lord points out, we should point out to you that the Welfare Plan has lived and we feel certain it m\\\\ live so long as the Lord continues to give his blessings to the Plan, and so long as the loyal, faithful members of the Church support it. But for your sakes we should rejoice beyond measure in your assistance. In one of his discourses. President McKay turned the attention of the people to the serious increase of divorce that is occurring in the world and from which the Latter-day Saints are not free. THE 115TH ANNUAL GENERAL CONFERENCE 329 It is, however, encouraging to know that, as President McKay explained, the divorce rate among this people is only a third as high as that in the nation. He also called attention to the fact that marriages, among our people, performed in the temple and by the officers of the Church, are much more stable than those performed by civil officers. He stated: In the light of scripture, we are justified in concluding that Christ's ideal pertaining to marriage is the unbroken home, and conditions that cause divorce are violations of his divine teachings. There may be circumstances which make the continuance of the marriage state a greater evil than divorce. But these are extreme cases they are the mistakes, the calamities in the realm of marriage.... Marriage is a sacred relationship entered into for purposes that are well recognized  primarily for the rearing of a family. It is claimed by some careful observers that our present modern life tends to frustrate these purposes.... The marriage ceremony, when sealed by the authority of the holy priesthood, endures as do family relationships, throughout time and all eternity. THE Church of the Air over the Columbia Broadcasting System had as its speaker President George Albert Smith, of the Council of the Twelve. His plea, made in great earnestness, was for repentance, individual and national. In this program and the regular broadcast that preceded it, sweet and impressive music of the Tabernacle Choir and organ was heard. Following are thoughts expressed during the conference by the speakers: Heaven's morning is bursting upon men's lives and they are feeling the hope that is beyond the grave. You mothers and sweethearts, take these men when they return wounded in spirit, and heal them. God is so good we can hardly conceive the extent of his goodness. God is so just we can hardly understand the depth of his justice. A non-member can have the blessings that come through honesty and the clean life, but no one can speak in the name of the Lord or hold Priesthood except he have membership in the Church. The saints have three most important obligations missionary work, building up the stakes and wards of Zion, and doing work in the temple. We are not landlords; we do not possess any part of this earth; we are tenants upon it. When the boys come home, the Mutual Improvement Association will have a greater responsibility than it has ever had before. No one should be idle at any age but industrious in spiritual as well as in temporal things, never burying his talent. Let nothing be laid at your door that would start anyone on the path of desecrating the Sabbath day. What peace would come to the earth if men would seek to know and do the will of God. The word \"must\" is not in our vocabulary. We are to persuade. I have never found a greater asset than the gospel of Jesus Christ. The boys who have stayed clean are the ones who have had correspondence with their Priesthood quorums. The gospel is not a substitution of something else for the lofty principles of Christianity, but a refinement of them and new vitality in them. Let us build our stakes as a refuge from the storms of adversity the Lord has said would come to the earth. May God be with those who meet at San Francisco, may they be humble, that human destiny on this good earth may be safe and beautiful. One of the best ways to drive out fear is to work hard in God's service. We claim no pre-eminence in physical (Concluded on page 371) Seymour Dilworth Young Pearl O.

A son, Dilworth Randolph, was killed in action in Belgium, October 25, 1944 SEYMOUR DILWORTH YOUNG comes to his new calling trained and grounded in missionary work by the very man whose place he has been appointed to fill, for he served as secretary to Elder Samuel O.

Dilworth Young-'Dil\" to his many friends became a member of the Seventy on April 6, 1945, he must have sensed, above the sound of congratulatory speeches, a wordless protest from his own home town. Page 330 For while adults said sagely, \"He's the man for the position,\" scores of Ogden boys looked at each other in honest bewilderment and said, \"How can we do without him?\" They began remembering things. Long summer hikes to Monte Cris-to. The taste of spring water in dusty throats. Night and stars and the comfort of a sleeping bag. The smell of wood smoke in the early morning. An evening campfire, and Dil Young leading them on in happy song, or weaving quiet magic for them out of old legends. To these boys their scout executive has always been something of a hero. He has managed to endow what might have been routine scouting with a sense of high adventure. SEYMOUR DILWORTH YOUNG 331 and to give meaning and excitement to the commonplace. If he has seemed at times, along the trail, a kind of glorified Kit Carson, the boys know, too, that he has in him more than a dash of Thoreau. There is a reflective, a poetic side, to Dil Young which has helped the most impatient and reckless among his charges to think, as well as do. It has taught them to look for beauty in unlikely places and to build qualities of greatness into their hearts and minds. Dil s friends need not ask what activities have brought him greatest satisfaction during the past twenty-two years. They have seen him at work sixteen hours a day, more often than not, rugged and bronzed in the summer as he shuttles between Camp Kiesel and Camp Browning, occupied endlessly in the winter with all the intricate problems of planning and organization his position demands. They will tell you he has a great power for indignation against the mean and the shoddy, and an uncompromising hatred of a lie. But he has, too, the gift of laughter and a quick sympathy. It seems safe to predict that the new work he is just beginning will be quickened by the zest for life which is so characteristic of him, that whatever he does will take buoyancy from his own spirit, and strength from his unquenchable youth."

I well remember that she was a very attractive young woman at that time, just as she is a very attractive matron at the present. And as a young college girl she was an outstanding student just as she is an outstanding mother and wife today. At the present time she is a member of the Cache Stake Relief Society Board, and the class leader in theology in the Logan Ninth Ward.

Backman, Executive Secretary Written at the Request of the Church Beautification Committee WHILE the uncertainties of war have entered into every phase of every life, be it the life of the individual, the family, the community or the state, one thing is certain, the one-hundredth anniversary of Utah, its Centennial year, will be celebrated in 1947.\nEven under wartime conditions, if the war should persist until 1947, there will be an appropriate celebration of the anniversary. The Utah Centennial Commission, under the chairmanship of President David O. McKay, has assured that, and the setting aside of a possible $200,000 for the 1945-46-47 biennium by the 26th Utah Legislature has implemented that assurance.\nDue to wartime conditions, plans for the Centennial celebration necessarily must be fluid. They must be made with such care that they can be changed quickly to meet the stupendous and instantaneous changes in conditions induced by the developments in warfare. They must also endeavor to carry to the nation and the world the heroic tale, the saga of the Utah pioneers that little band of Latter-day Saints who fought the elements, the Indians, and every adverse condition to find in Utah their haven for freedom of religious worship.\nWith conditions most uncertain, with the possibility that travel to Utah by outsiders in 1947 may be almost non-existent, and with the chance for a national or international exposition in the State absolutely impossible because of building restrictions and shortages, the Centennial Commission, appointed by the Governor of Utah, has turned to other means of telling the world of the historic tale of Utah.\nThe Commission, therefore, has developed a new plan of observance of the celebration. It embodies: (1) a national publicity program calling the attention of the nation to the observance of Utah's Centennial; and (2) the development in all sections of the State of a program which will acquaint the people of the State with a proper background of its historical significance.\nThe program, originally projected under wartime conditions, is aimed at that two-fold purpose. To call the attention of the nation to the Utah Centennial, State assistance will be given in an effort to bring every national event, every publicity-wise happening to the State during 1947. Included are:\nNational PGA golf championships, national Clay Court championships, national slalom ski championships, national ski cross-country championships; national ski jumping championships, national rodeo championships in four major events, nationally famous football, basketball, track and field events, and other nationally famous events such as livestock championships, music festivals, minor sports events of national importance and others. Page 336 WE'LL LIVE THOSE DAYS AGAIN 337 \"WE'LL LIVE THOSE DAYS AGAIN\" Locally, the Commission envisions the promotion of such events as are typical of Utah, including the Tabernacle Choir, the Zion Park passion play, the Timpanogos hike, the development of the Great Salt Lake area, the story of the Mormon pioneers, and the promotion of Utah's scenic, recreational, and vacational assets. Thus, if traveling restrictions are lifted by 1947 for the general public, many may be attracted to the State. If they are still in force, through national events, nation-wide publicity may be obtained and, at the same time, the story of the development of Utah industrially, culturally, religiously, and in business may be impressed upon the people of the State. THERE are many facets to the celebration which are not yet developed. Actually under the State appropriations, the funds are not available until July 1, 1945. But, if var conditions permit, there are many events which are exceedingly interesting. For instance, if ODT regulations make it possible, and funds are available, there is a project to re-live the trek of the original pioneers across the plains. True to history, these modern pioneers will leave St. Joseph, Missouri, and follow the historic Mormon trail, hour by hour and day by day, re-living the life of the pioneers, making every one of the night stops, and holding services or camp-fire meetings just (Concluded on page 372)"

Cannon Chairman General Music Committee ANEW hymn book, to be used in all adult meetings of the Church is in preparation by the General Music Committee in co-operation with an advisory committee from the Council of the Twelve. The new books will supersede the present Latter-day Saints Hymns and Deseret Sunday School Songs. In addition to preserving those hymns that have been found to be of permanent value to the Church, the new hymn book will include some hymns with new music settings, a number of famous hymns from worldwide sources, and some original hymns, the words and music of which will be written by present-day writers and composers. Already many local poets have graciously responded to the General Music Committee's invitation to send in hymns, and the Committee is deeply appreciative of their efforts. It is now desired that music settings be made to some of the hymns, and composers are invited by the Advisory Committee of the Council of the Twelve and the General Music Committee to send in contributions according to the following suggestions: 1. The music is to be suitable in pitch, range, singableness and dignity for use by the congregations of the Church. Page 338 2. You are invited to make a music setting for any one of the poems here printed. (Please send in only one manuscript. ) 3. Sign your manuscript with a nom de plume. Place your own name and address in a sealed envelope and write your nom de plume on the outside of the envelope. Enclose this with your manuscript. 4. Send the completed manuscript to Carol H. Cannon, Assistant Secretary, General Music Committee, 200 North Main Street, Salt Lake City 3, Utah, not later than July 1st of this year. It is hoped that all musicians of our communities, schooled in the art of composition, will respond to this invitation. Following are five hymns for which worthy music settings are desired: SEE! ALL CREATION JOINS See! All creation joins To praise the eternal God; The heav'nly hosts begin the song. And sound His name abroad. The sun with golden beams. The moon with silver rays. The starry lights and twinkling flames. Shine to their Maker's praise. He built those worlds above. And fixed their wondrous frame. By His command they stand or move, And always speak His fame. The fleecy clouds that rise. Or following show'rs, or snow, The thunder rolling round the skies, His power and glory show. THE NEW LATTER-DAY SAINT HYMN BOOK 339 The broad expanse on high. With all the heav'ns afford, The lightning's fire that streaks the sky. Unite to praise the Lord. By all that shines above. His glory is expressed; But Saints who know His endless love. Should sing His praises best. HOW BEAUTEOUS ARE THEIR FEET How beauteous are their feet Who stand on Zion's hill. Who bring salvation on their tongues And words of peace reveal. How charming is their voice! How sweet their tidings are: \"Zion, behold thy Saviour King, He reigns in triumph here.\" How blessed are our ears That hear this joyful sound, Which kings and prophets waited for And sought, but never found. The Lord makes bare His arm Through all the earth abroad: Let every nation now behold Its Saviour and its God. SAVIOUR, REDEEMER OF MY SOUL Saviour, Redeemer of my soul. Whose mighty hand hath made me whole, Whose wondrous pow'r hath raised me up, And filled with sweet my bitter cup! What tongue my gratitude can tell, O gracious God of Israel. Never can I repay Thee, Lord; But I can love Thee. Thy pure word. Hath it not been my one delight, My joy by day, my dream by night? Then let my lips proclaim it still, And all my life reflect Thy will. O'errule mine acts to serve Thine ends; Change frowning foes to smiling friends; Chasten my soul till I shall be In perfect harmony with Thee. Make me more worthy of Thy love. And fit me for the life above. MAY THE LORD GO WITH US May the Lord go with us. And with us abide By His Holy Spirit To direct and guide. As from here we sever Now, and still forever May the Lord go with us And with us abide. May the Lord go with us. And His tender love. As a mantle o'er us, Still our shelter prove; Till with happy greeting, We, in joyful meeting. Lift again our voices To the courts above. May the Lord go with us, Then are we secure; Life or death befalling, We can still endure; With His arms enfolding  To His promise holding. We can travel onward. Ever safe and sure. LORD, WE COME BEFORE THEE NOW Lord, we come before Thee now, At Thy feet we humbly bow; Do not Thou our suit disdain; Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain? In Thine own appointed way. Now we seek Thee, here we stay; Lord, from hence we would not go, Till a blessing Thou bestow. Send some message from Thy word, That may joy and peace afford; Comfort those who weep and mourn. Let \"the time of love\" return. Grant, we all may seek and find Thee, our gracious God and kind; Heal the sick, the captive free, Let us all rejoice in Thee."

            "content": "And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER I \n\nDELSA came running into the house, her light brown curls flying in the wind, her blue eyes shining, her whole young body eager and confident, for Nellie Gibson, the postmaster's little girl, had said when she came back to school at noon, \"Your ma was in for the mail, and there was a letter from Hugh Temple for you, Miss Delsa.\"\nHer mother called from the kitchen, \"There's a letter from Hugh on the table, dear!\" and Delsa picked up the heavy gray envelope, scrawled across with Hugh's awkward handwriting.\nShe tore the envelope open, unfolded the gray sheets, and stood leaning lightly against the table, reading the words Hugh had written.\nHer mother came to the kitchen door, interested, persistent, and said, \"What does he say, Delsa? His mother's letter didn't come today \"\nWhat did he say? Delsa's eyes stared at the letter in her hand. What could she say he said?\n\"Oh, nothing much ,\" and as her mother still stood there waiting, she added, forcing her lips to form the words, forcing her voice up through stiff muscles, \"He's still in Australia can't say where or what he is doing, of course. He's okay \"\nShe turned and went swiftly from the room, up the stairs, before her mother's shrewd eyes could read her heart could see the devastation there.\nIn her own room, she flung herself on the floor by the window and stared out. Across the lawn she could see Hugh's house, Hugh's very window. They'd strung string across the space when they were very small, string tied to Delsa's big toe, so that Hugh could yank it and awaken her to go fishing in the little stream that didn't have any fish in it. Later they'd rigged up a tin-can telephone so they could talk to each other in code.\nWhat had Hugh written?\nNothing much, she had said. Just enough to wreck all the hopes and dreams of her whole twenty years; just enough to make the future a black waste with neither love nor joy in it.\nDELSA stared at the empty envelope on her knees. There was no need to take out the scrawled sheets again; she knew just what they said \n\"Dear Delsa I don't know how to say this \nBut he had said it. Hugh had said the words that ended everything. He wanted to break off their engagement. He'd found a girl, an Australian oh, she was different from anything he'd ever dreamed, and his love for her was different. But he wouldn't marry her unless Delsa would absolve him of the promises he had made to her.\nHow like Hugh! I consider those promises as binding as a marriage vow, Delsa. I meant them just as permanently when I made them. And I won t write to Mom about it. I feel like a heel, putting you in an awkward place like this, and I want you to handle it the way you think best.  Page 340 AND FOR ETERNITY 341 Tell them anything you wish. Both my Mom and yours are going to feel bad, I know. But they'll get over it and so will you, Delsa, long before I have a chance to come home with my bride. I don't expect you to forgive me, Delsa, but I hope you will forget, soon. Now I understand that was just a kid love I still feel it for you and when you meet someone you'll be glad this happened. I'll be waiting for your letter, Delsa. Be kind. Delsa's lips grew bitter as she thought, Be kind, Hugh? How can one kill one's heart kindly? And forget? Forget all those past years when she and Hugh had played together on the scraggly lawn between the two houses; when they'd eaten either at her place or his, without a thought of which was home; forget the affection that had bound them together, tight and brave against their little world? As they had grown older and Hugh's widowed mother had struggled to keep Hugh in school and the little farm going while she cared for his little sister, crippled with polio, and as Delsa's father, twisted with arthritis had found it difficult to make ends meet even in their small town, the two children had found strength and joy in their companionship. At high school they had gone in for dramatics and the school paper and debate and had made a name and a place for themselves. Hugh had seen to it that Delsa went to all the school dances, had all the fun the other girls had, and Delsa had seen to it that Hugh was never ashamed of his girl. They'd both worked so hard that they had won scholarships to the state university; and they had both tried to train themselves for worthwhile work in their little community  Delsa as a teacher, Hugh as a farmer. Then the war had come, interrupting their plans. Hugh had had to leave his school and his home and Delsa. \"We could get married now, Delsa,\" he had said, \"and have a little time together before, I leave. But \" the frown had deepened between his dark brows, and Delsa knew what he must, but hated to say. \"I know,\" she had answered. \"I know, Hugh.\" \"Mom's always been so poor. She's had to get along without so many things. I had planned to do some of these for her before we got married as soon as I finished school. But I can't now. I can't do any of them. The only thing I can do, Delsa, is send her my allotment. And if we got married \" \"She wouldn't want to take your money then, Hugh, and she would hate it as charity if I offered to help. You're right; we are young and strong. We can wait.\" They had walked along somberly after that, trying to hide the ache in their hearts the ache of waiting because they were young and strong and others had grown old and weak. Waiting for them to grow up. Hugh had come home on furlough before overseas assignment, and Delsa had felt that she could not bear to let him go again without binding him to her irrevocably. And Hugh had felt something of the same desire to cheat the fate that was separating them. \"Let's get married, Delsa!\" he had begged her. \"Let's get married right now. It isn't fair, it isn't right for us to wait when we don't know what will happen.\" Delsa had put her hands on his shoulders and kissed him tenderly. \"We can't, Hugh, and you know we can't. We've got obligations to others besides ourselves. You have your mother and sister I've got a job teaching. Our love is strong enough to wait, Hugh.\" Delsa's heart-had felt crushed and sore, but she had known that she must be the strong one. She had planned it out so many times, and had always come back to the fundamental fact that Hugh's pitiful allowance was not enough to split between two families . So at last, Hugh had had to give in, and that had hurt Delsa, too, even worse than it had the boy. But she had accepted the teaching job right here at home so she could still help her mother and Hugh's with her companionship and gaiety. And Hugh had gone back to camp and then across the ocean to a far, strange land. Delsa had been afraid of the war, of the danger and hardship Hugh must suffer, but she had never once been afraid of this. She had never once thought that anything, except death, could separate them. Oh, Hugh! Hugh! How could she tell her mother?\" Hugh's mother? They both counted on this marriage, had never thought of any other possibility. If they knew what Hugh had done, they'd be hurt and shamed, and Delsa couldn't bear to think of those two women whom she loved averting their eyes, apologizing to each other and to her. Delsa crept into bed; and when her mother, solicitous and loving. Came to see what was wrong, she said, \"I've got a headache, Mother. I gave examinations today and tried to correct the papers at noon and recess. I'll be all right.\" Mrs. Marriott folded the coverlet closer about her daughter, and laid a testing palm against her brow. \"It's Hugh,\" she said. \"Oh, the times are so hard on you young people. But don't worry, Delsa, Hugh will be all right. You have to keep that faith or you have noth-mg. Delsa reached up and pressed her mother's hand. \"I know,\" she whispered. \"I'm not worrying, really. Just tired.\" Her mother went out, closing the door softly. Delsa closed her eyes against the darkening room. A March wind blew fiercely about the house, shaking the trees outside Delsa's window, shaking the walls that needed repairing, rattling the windows, loose in their frames. So much still needed to be done about the place, Delsa thought wearily; her small checks helped only a little with the ever-recurring bills. She heard her father come into the kitchen below her, stamping his feet on the porch, wiping the mud of the March thaw from his shoes before he stepped onto the clean kitchen floor. She could almost see the pails, foaming to the brim with the fresh, warm milk, and her mother, holding the strainer while her father poured the milk into the pan. Her mother was talking, and though Delsa couldn't hear the words, she knew she was telling her father about Hugh's letter and how it had worried Delsa because he was so far away and in danger. AND FOR ETERNITY 343 Delsa thought, What if she were tellng him the truth, now? What would Dad say? What would he do? He wouldn't believe it Why do I believe it all at once like this? Why do I know without the slightest doubt that it is true? It wasn't only her father who would be incredulous. There were all her friends, the girls she had grown up with her crowd and Hugh's. She might meet Millie Lewis on the street and say, \"Hello, Millie. Have you heard the news? Hugh's marrying an Australian girl  some one he's met down there.\" THERE was a soft knock on her door and her mother came in very quietly so as not to awaken her if she was sleeping. Delsa said, \"What is it. Mother?\" \"Hugh's mother is downstairs. Gibson told her you got a letter from Hugh, and she wondered what he said. She didn't get one today, and she's worried.\" Delsa said, forcing her voice to sound firm and bright, \"Come on up. Aunt Martha. I'm just resting  had a horrible day exams and all.\" Hugh's mother came into the darkened room and Delsa explained lightly, \"My head aches from correcting papers. I can't bear the light. Aunt Martha. But Hugh's all right., He said he was feeling fine and he expects to be right there in the same place for some time. He's not in danger right now You know Hugh. He won't say anything the censor could object to, but he sounded safe and and happy.\" Why was she such a coward? She had to tell them sometime unless, unless she could go away, somewhere, and never see them or Hugh again. Mrs. Temple sat down beside Delsa's bed. \"You work too hard with those kids, Delsa. Heavens, they never had a teacher before that put in so much time with them. Even Jeff Holden, good as he is as a principal, doesn't kill himself, you'll notice. But you've told me what I wanted to know, Delsa, that Hugh's all right. I give thanks every day that it's you he writes to, so I can get a crumb now and then when my own letters don't come. Not that Hugh doesn't write to me often you know he does but he can't always write to both of us, now can he? So it's a good thing we're so close and can share and share alike. He's not been sick?\" \"No, he didn't say anything about being sick. Aunt Martha. He sounded right well.\" Share and share alike! Aunt Martha wouldn't like a strange, Australian daughter-in-law. But she would have to, if Hugh brought one home. Aunt Martha went on, \"Guess what I did today, Delsa? I finished piecing that quilt for you the double bridal ring, you know and is it pretty! I guess I'll have to have a quilting bee to get it quilted. But I reckon it won't be difficult to get folks to help with a quilt for your hope chest.\" She patted the coverlet and rose. \"You get a good night's sleep, Delsa. You take things easier. I don't want Hugh coming home and blaming us for letting you work yourself to a shadow. You wait till I see Jeff Holden and I'll give him a (Continued on page 371)"

No loss of rank, abatement of character, or ostracism from society must darken the pathway of the humblest of the seekers after truth, the right of free thought, free inquiry and free speech as clear as the noonday. Without a full and cheerful recognition of this right America is only a name, her glory a dream, her institution a mockery.... S. A. Fullmer. Orangeville, Emery Co., May 10, 1885 Editorial: Some Affairs in England Gladstone's resignation of the position next to the Queen herself must have been a surprise to the English people, who look with such pride and admiration upon all places of honor near the throne, and especially upon any one who is in confidence of her Royal Highness. This movement will be likely to bring about serious consequences, although, perhaps the Marquis of Salisbury, whom the Queen immediately summoned to her assistance to aid in arranging matters with a view to creating a new cabinet, may manage the present crisis of affairs so diplomatically that the people will scarcely realize the radical change that is being brought about, for England has an adaptation in matters of State, whereby very grave questions are adjusted with such nicety and precision that the great world scarcely heeds it more than a ripple on a Summer era. In October, 1876, President Young called upon the sisters through the Woman's Exponent to lay up grain against a day of famine, and on the 11th of November following Mrs. E. B. Wells was chosen President of the Grain Association. At the same meeting measures were taken to publish a book called \"The Women of Mormondom.\" The Relief Society in the branches throughout the Stakes of Zion have been engaged from year to year ever since in the storing of wheat, and many of them have built store-houses of their own, in which to preserve it. Thousands of bushels have, since that time, been stored away by the sisters, and they look upon it as one of the important missions given them to perform.... R. C. Atwood. RELIEF SOCIETY REPORTS Whitechapel Branch, London On the above date (March 25th) was celebrated the eleventh anniversary of the Relief Society of the above branch by the usual concert or entertainment. The programme had received a wise and judicious censorship, and so nothing occurred or passed that could have offended the most cultured taste, or infringed in the least degree upon the rules of propriety. As Saints of God we desire to set a good example in all things, even in our amusements. In this limited space all that can be done is to make a passing reference to a few, who, by their talents, seem to demand some notice. All, however, tried to do their best. I will here remark that the concert was graced with the presence of Elder C. W. Penrose, the talented Editor of the Deseret News.

Cannon THE December bulletin of the International Council of Women carries a message from the Council's president, the Belgian Baroness Marthe PolBoel, exulting in her country's regained freedom, and expressing deepest gratitude to its liberators. She asserts that even in their darkest hour the Belgians did not doubt either their friends or themselves. During the Baroness' internment, Dr. Renee Girod carried on as acting president from neutral Switzerland, while Lady Nunburnholme, first vice-president, issued some of the bulletins from London. Says the latter, world peace will be very difficult to attain, but \"every new birth is linked with pain.\" IN most countries, the National Councils of Women are working for greater social security and an equal wage scale for women and men. In addition, the 'Belgian women are asking for: the vote; women police; a woman member of the national radio-information council; medical examinations for returned prisoners and deportees; the same treatment for widows of Belgians executed for patriotism as for regular war widows. DURING the past year American women have had a voice in international councils. Dean C. Mildred Thompson of Vassar College was a delegate to the Allied Ministers of Education Conference in London. At the Hot Springs, Virginia, Conference on Food and Agriculture, Josephine Schain was a delegate from the United States. Mrs. Ellen S. Woodward, a member of the Social Security Board, and Miss Elizabeth Conkey were American delegates to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Conference. Our women also attended the International Labor Conference held at Philadelphia, April 1944. OF the 125,000,000 impoverished people of Europe, great numbers of children are living in roofless homes. In many cases ten people must live in one room. There is much hunger and lack of adequate clothing and bedding. AMONG our American WAC are 315 young Indian women. LAST year 250,000 babies were born under the Emergency Maternity Program. EVE GARRETTE has written for instruction and entertainment A Political Handbook for Women. Some chapter titles are: \"Things You Want to Know About Your Constitution,\" \"Why Do We Have Political Parties?\" \"How to Get Into Politics.\" Page 345 EDITORIAL \n\nVOL. 32 JUNE 1945 NO. 6 President Heber J. Grant RELIEF Society has sustained a great loss in the passing of our beloved and revered President, Heber J. Grant. For many years this organization has enjoyed the personal interest of this great Church leader. It has benefited from his thoughtful considerations, his wise counsel, and his generous support of its varied activities. President Grant was the son of a Relief Society mother. For thirty years Rachel Ivins Grant served as president of Relief Society in the Thirteenth Ward. From the time he was a small child until he grew too old to attend. President Grant accompanied his mother to Relief Society meetings where he became familiar with the work of the Society and learned of its importance and value. He became acquainted with early-day Relief Society leaders, enjoying a personal, intimate association with these sisters. He observed their nobility of character and their devotion to duty and he has often borne testimony of their influence upon his life. In an address given at a general conference of Relief Society in 1937, he paid a tribute to these sisters as follows: \"I owe more to the love and teachings of my mother, to Eliza R. Snow and the Relief Society sisters than I do to the brethren. Why? Because I grew up from a little child in the Relief Society meetings. Mother had no one to leave me Page 346 with, and I played on the floor in many of those meetings. Aunt Eliza used to talk to me by the hour and tell me things about the Prophet Joseph Smith, and it inspired in my heart a love for him almost beyond my ability to express; in fact, my mother, Sister Snow, and others, inspired in me a love for the Gospel and the Prophet Joseph Smith and the authorities of the Church by their devotion to the work of God, by their example, not by talk alone.\" In a message to Relief Society women, October 1940, President Grant paid the following tribute to Relief Society general presidents and Board members: \"Every president of the General Board of Relief Society has been a devout, intelligent, fine, loyal Latter-day Saint; and I have known most of the members of the Board, and they are among the choicest of our people.\" President Grant has continuously encouraged Relief Society women and his blessings have sustained them. At the time of the Relief Society Centennial observance when, due to the engagement of the United States in war, the planned Centennial program had to be greatly modified and when the sisters with anxious hearts faced the trying experiences which accompany war, President Grant's words of instruction, commendation, and blessing were a guiding power and a comforting influence. He prayed for them: \"May our Heavenly Father bless the mothers in Israel and all who are engaged in building up the kingdom of God on the earth. May the peace and blessings of heaven abide in your homes and be upon you and your loved ones now and forever.\"\nRelief Society women are grateful for the life of President Grant. They acknowledge his support, the wisdom of his leadership, and the influence of his testimony. His greatest desire for us was that we live in accordance with the teachings of the gospel and that we zealously devote ourselves to the work of the Church. May we ever honor him by so doing. May the comforting blessings of Heaven rest upon Sister Grant and the other bereaved loved ones.\n?B.S.S. SENTIMENTS OF PRESIDENT GRANT If I know my own heart, I believe it is set upon the advancement of the Church and kingdom of God. I know that there is nothing on the earth that I rejoice over so much as I do in the fact that I am associated with the servants and handmaidens of God in the Church of Jesus Christ; and I do not believe that there ever is a day that passes over my head that I do not thank God for the restoration again of the plan of life and salvation, and that I have been made a partaker of the same. I supplicate Him earnestly that my mind may never become darkened, that I may never depart from the truth; that I may never forget any of the covenants that I have made, but, as I grow in years and increase in understanding, that I may grow in a testimony of the gospel and in the desire?not only a desire, but in doing it ?to labor for the onward advancement of the kingdom of God on the earth. I have perhaps announced before, but I will announce again, that in a meeting of some of the Presidents of Ward Relief Societies held in the Salt Lake Stake, which then embraced the entire County of Salt Lake, I was a child, playing on the floor. Eliza R. Snow had the gift of tongues, and Sister Zina D. Young gave the interpretation, and predicted that I should live to be one of the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ in this last dispensation. Naturally, I have been very grateful for that splendid blessing given to me. At that time I did not understand it, I did not comprehend it?did not know anything about it. I look forward with the keenest pleasure of meeting in the hereafter Hamilton G. Park, George Goddard, Bishop Nelson Empey, Bishop Edwin D. Woolley, Bishop Milieu Atwood, and others who have made an impression for good upon my mind and heart as a boy. I could mention scores of others to whom I am indebted. I shall be grateful throughout all the ages of eternity to those men for the impression that they made upon me. We may think that the impressions we make may not be lasting, but I can assure you they are, I am sure that a testimony borne by a teacher to little children, under the inspiration of the living God, is a difficult thing for them to forget."

            "content": "Home Problems In Wartime Edna K. Ward WE who cannot carry the gun can still carry on. To our husbands or sons in the fox holes or in the jungle, thoughts of home and of mother sustain them during the awful experience and stress of war. Our duration duty in addition to war activities is to preserve the home as he remembers it. In reviewing some of the practical problems that wartime shortages and restrictions create, let us consider possible means of prolonging the life of the following furnishings and equipment in the home: Draperies Curtains Blinds Carpets Furniture Linens Kitchen equipment Shoes At the present time all fabrics are very difficult to replace. The new, postwar fabrics promise to be something well worth waiting for. A great many will be immune to ordinary wear and tear, resistant to soil and dust, easy to clean and sun-fast. Rugs and woolens will be moth proof, blankets will refuse to shrink, and organdies and window curtains will retain their crispness. Making our present fabrics last through serves two good purposes: (1) lessens the demand on our present, limited civilian supplies. (2) invites replacement with the newer textiles that will be available after the war. This replacement is a backlog of postwar employment. Page 348 Draperies and Curtains The greatest enemy of fabrics is the combustion products in the atmosphere of our cities, especially in the winter time. These products, plus moisture, create acid chemicals that attack the substance of the fabric. If draperies and curtains are cleaned with vacuum attachments regularly through the cold winter months the wearability and beauty will be greatly improved. 1. Where there is city smoke, vacuum and brush draperies and curtains once a week during the coldest winter months. 2. Wash glass curtains when needed, using careful methods of handling, mild soaps, and proper water temperature. 3. Darn tiny breaks or holes in glass curtains with threads of the curtain material from the turned hem. (Most curtain hems are double.) Do this before laundering. 4. If stretchers are used, measure curtains before laundering and set stretchers 3-4 inches narrower to prevent the wet material from splitting under strain. All rayon loses tensile strength when damp. The new postwar material will not need to be stretched. 5. For spring cleaning, lay draperies on sheets spread on the floor and wipe with numerous Turkish towels, using non-inflammable cleaning fluid for spots. Blinds Most blinds are washable. These can be laid flat on the floor on a sheet and warm soapy water used with a washing cloth, a rinsing cloth, and a dry cloth. If wiped dry they can be rolled and replaced at once. Do not rub parallel to the edge? this tends to stretch the edges. Carpets Regular vacuuming keeps rugs and carpets clean. The rotary-brush-type vacuum should not be set too low or it tends to beat the nap out of the carpet. With the deeper pile rugs, soiling will be mainly on the surface and spots and respond to an old bath towel wrung from soapy water or moistened with non-inflammable cleaning fluids. Never use gasoline in the home. Many serious accidents have resulted from the use of inflammable cleaning fluids which are ignited by the static electric spark created by rubbing.\nRugs should be turned to avoid wear in places of most use. Throw rugs or places of heavy traffic are a good investment.\nStairway rugs can usually be reversed to bring edge wear on other places. Extra length tucked under at one end can be moved up to bring tread wear to a new surface.\nFurniture\nThe fine surface and finish of good furniture requires very little attention other than frequent dusting. Two or three times a year the surface should be washed, using a mild, soapy water, a clean rinse cloth, and a dry cloth. Then apply furniture polish with a damp cloth. Allow to dry one-half hour and polish.\nLight scratches and marks are improved by using a mixture of beeswax dissolved in turpentine until the mixture is the consistency of molasses and applied with a woolen cloth.\nUpholstered furniture keeps clean with frequent brushing and spotting with non-inflammable cleaning fluid.\nTufting buttons may be replaced with a mattress needle and heavy linen twine. This tufting helps keep springs in their proper place.\nHousehold Linens\nAll mattresses should be turned once a week. Mattress pads or folded cotton blankets can be kept fresh by frequent laundering. The habit of shaking all quilts and blankets at least once a month aids in keeping lint from accumulating. Changing both sheets at the same time makes a really fresh bed, rather than only a half-fresh bed where the top sheet is used for the bottom.\nTo preserve linens (sheets, tablecloths, napkins, handkerchiefs) don't iron along the folds where wear shows first. Small linens like napkins, luncheon cloths, handkerchiefs, and guest towels can be ironed flat, laid out on a table or rack and then folded by hand. All table linen will wear much longer if rolled. Bamboo poles on which carpets are rolled, or pasteboard rolls covered with tissue paper may be used. This is the place to utilize those Christmas wrappings you saved?for the rolls themselves and to cover the linens.\nWorn sheets can be torn down the middle, the outer edges sewn together and the resulting outer edges hemmed. This will give many extra months' wear. Worn sheets also can be cut down and hemmed for crib sizes, made into pillow cases, or used as covers for summer dresses and suits stored in closets during the winter, and vice versa for winter garments. When changing a sheet be careful \nnot to pull it off without first releasing it from bottom and sides. Flour and sugar sacks used for dish towels gain appearance and life when hemmed. Our mothers and grandmothers used these sacks for children's undies. With children's clothing selling at the high prices it is today, and materials so difficult to get, why couldn't this old-fashioned, thrifty habit be revived using modern innovations? Linoleum Many of the linoleum factories have closed, and many are closing this spring as are also the rug and carpet factories. Linoleum can be preserved to double the wear by regular waxing. Either liquid or hard wax may be used. The writer has just recently tried a new, clear plastic paint on her linoleum drainboards that also may be used for floors. It gives a shiny, smooth appearance and claims preservation of the linoleum. These new plastic products promise to fulfill many needs in the home as they are smooth, resistant to heat and staining, and are highly durable. Refrigerators and Ranges Refrigerators should be cleaned regularly. Enamel is preserved by avoiding hard knocks on the inside or outside. The \"handy man of the home\" or the utility service man can at intervals check the fan belt, clean the deposit from the radiator, and oil the motor in the electric-type unit. Units on ranges last longer if food is not allowed to boil over, and if the units are lifted out and cleaned carefully, but thoroughly, after each use. Turn units to low or simmer to keep foods just at the rolling boil. This helps prevent scorching, saves fuel and often keeps things from boiling over. Avoid opening oven doors carelessly or placing heavy objects on oven doors or dropping them onto the enamel. Repair service cannot be had at once, and parts often cannot be replaced. Have a place of storage for each piece of the small kitchen equipment. This will save your time, your disposition, and your equipment, and, in addition, it will greatly improve the orderly appearance of the kitchen itself. A clean, well-organized, well-lighted kitchen is the \"heart of the home.\" From that kitchen come many of the pleasant memories that our boys are dreaming about right now in their fox holes. And very soon after returning, it is the place to which they will gravitate. Shoes One of the real problems now with shoe rationing is prolonging the life of children's shoes. Our fathers owned a shoe last, an awl, a hammer and a box of tacks. Leather soles costing twenty-five cents were tacked on as the original sole began to fail. This doubled the life of a shoe and could sometimes be repeated. The revival of this thrifty custom, particularly with large families, would ease materially the strain on the budget and the shoe coupons. Let's take care of our homes. The old things that have had loving care and been preserved are often much more beautiful than newer, flashy modern things."

            "content": "Unanswered Prayers Marguerite J. Griffin \n\nSPUNKY our cat died, but will never be forgotten. The boys accepted the event as something from which there was no appeal, but my little daughter's heart seemed torn with the longing that it might not have been. Perhaps the boys felt these same emotions and only kept them buried. In any event, it was she who a few days later brought her disturbed emotions out into the light to me.\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"while you took Spunky to the hospital, I went up to my room and prayed three times.\" There was emphasis upon the numeral. \"Doesn't God love cats like he does people?\"\nThere was no humor in the eyes of this little daughter of mine. This was one of the most serious questions she had ever asked me in her eight years. She had been taught to pray. She had been taught to recognize God's blessings. She had believed she need only ask and he would hear and answer her prayer. But this time?this time when she had sought him urgently thrice, he had failed to grant her request. Spunky's life had been taken.\nSearch your hearts, adults. Has the same question ever gnawed at your peace of mind? Have you ever thought, \"It is no use to pray, God may not hear\"? Can you recall, now, some of the stories that have come out of this war, of men abandoned on sea or desert, who, motivated by the sharp pangs of physical hunger, have united their voices together in prayer to be saved, sustenance and for food? Can you recall how some of these men, when the answer seemed delayed, ridiculed the idea that there is a God, while others kept their faith and waited in patience until the reward at last came.\nPatience comes into a man from an outward source, from a faith in something bigger than himself. The captain who knows his ship well, who has faith in the skill of the company which created it for him, can ride through the stormiest squall in it, secure in the knowledge that it is a good ship and will weather the storm, whereas the humble passenger who is in ignorance of the vessel's quality, who has never before faced a storm at sea, may find his physical body torn and weakened by an overpowering terror that it worse than the raging wind and weather. However, in the landwork of men there is always the possibility of flaws, there is always reasonable doubt. The storm might bring to light a defect in the boat's construction, a weakness in some spot that might mean danger. The captain knows this and places special watches throughout the storm. The crew becomes more vigilant. If an emergency arises?well, it is emergencies that test the mettle of men, be they passengers or captains. And there are some terrors under which the delicate mechanisms that are flesh and blood and nerves break, if they have nothing stronger than themselves to cling to.\n Page  But there was once a Man, who, by a gentle word, stilled the winds and the waves of Galilee when his shipmates cried out in fear of the storm. He himself could have slept through it unafraid, but when they awakened him, he answered their need. He lives yet to calm the troubled heart. If he quieted the squall, can he not do as much to your fears? Peace, my heart, be still. So I told my little daughter the story of the Man of Galilee who was God's very own Son, and how he prayed so fervently in the Garden of Gethsemane when his soul was \"sorrowful even unto death\" because of the thing which lay ahead of him to do. Though he was a God, yet he shrank from the pain, from the anguish of the ordeal. \"Father,\" he prayed, \"all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.\" Three times he offered this same plea, \"If it be possible remove this cup.\" But the prayer was not answered because it was not his Heavenly Father's will, and Christ prayed for his Father's will, not his own, to be done. On our part we often ask for things which are not good for us, or which would deny others. What would have happened had God spared his Son's life? What would have been our state, yours and mine? Sometimes it is hard for man's logic to perceive just why this is so, but the scriptures tell us: \"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead; for as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" According to the great plan, had Christ failed in his mission, death would not \"have been swallowed up in victory,\" and where then, would have been our hope? Divine purposes are not always understood by the human mind, but in the family circle we come nearest to the type of heavenly things. As we are concerned with the welfare of all our children, so our Heavenly Father's work and glory is the salvation of all of us, not just a select one or two. Do we as earthly parents allow our little ones to select, as the only food for their meals, the sweets which, of course, are the most tasty to their tongues? Ask any small youngster what he would like for dinner. He may say, as often as not, \"Cookie\" or \"Ice cream.\" But no loving parent would grant him that request first. For what would happen? The child would have no appetite left for milk and vegetables, the nourishing elements from which his body must grow. So he sees no cookie on his tray at first, and sometimes he frets about it, but after he has eaten the needful things, then comes the dessert, last of all. So, often, we are like children. We want the sweets of life right now, not realizing that a taste of the bitter first but makes us enjoy the sweetness more. \"Be not children in understanding: Howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.\" God's ways are not the ways of men, but we can be sure his ways are best. Sometimes I think if we could only see more clearly, if our eyes were envisioned to a time longer than the bounds of our short years, we would discern that even our worries, our troubles, our sufferings, but give us greater strength for future days.\nIN October of 1941, so shortly before Pearl Harbor, my husband and I took a trip in our car, traveling through some six of our Western States. This was in the days, you remember, when there was plenty of gasoline and practically no speed limit on the open road. I recall that vacation now with nostalgia, even in spite of the fact that for the first few days we were most sorely vexed with flat tires. What annoyance when our time was so limited and we wished to travel so far! What vexation as, one by one, we discovered that the new tires which had been on the used car we had bought some six months previous were filled with old, patched tubes, or tubes too large for the tires. With the little driving we had done around town we had had no trouble, but now, spinning along the open highway, it was a sequence of purchasing new tubes. This distressed us, too, for we had made a very close budget, and this unexpected expense strained it considerably. We thought fate was harsh with us.\nAt the moment, nothing seemed worse than the delays and expense, but the events of a restless world moved rapidly, and we saw the outcome of this experience in a very short time. Then it took no special sort of genius to realize how lucky we had been, for we were ready to face the duration with brand new tubes in our tires, whereas otherwise (perhaps I should say by now our car would not have been available for use on the guest emergencies. We've often spoken of this and have been ashamed of our annoyance, yes, our anger even, those first few days of our last traveling vacation. Now I try to remember the lesson of the tires when new problems and worries come upon me, and I tell myself: \"If I could just see a little farther, maybe this, too, will be for the best.\"\nPaul said, \"We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.\" I am learning to realize that, too, as experiences come in life. I am learning that the important thing is to love God no matter what happens to us, no matter if he denies is our petition today, no matter if our hearts or our bodies must bleed and suffer, no matter if it would seem that he has forsaken us or is scourging us with many stripes.\nHave ye \"forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, my son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?\" And while a son may be rebuked more bitterly than a servant in the house or a guest, remember that his status and rewards are vastly different. He is heir to all that his father has. \"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: Shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits and live? . . . Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: Nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.\"\nBut regardless of what we must own, \"And the Lord turned the captivity of Job\" (and you know how much he had endured) \"when he . . . prayed for his friends.\" Even a child can understand the glory of this.\n\"I shall pray for my brothers,\" said my little daughter. They are sorry Spunky's gone, but they don't say anything. They must hurt a lot inside.\"\nOh, yes, let us pray for each other and for a pain-racked world. Let us pray for our brothers and our neighbors who share our burdens. Let us not even forget our enemies, \"for they know not what they do\"\nor our foe, that has a reward of its own. \"And the Lord turned the captivity of Job\" (and you know how much he had endured) \"when he . . . and mark you well these words . . . when he prayed for his friends.\" Even a child can understand the glory of this.\n\"I shall pray for my brothers,\" said my little daughter. They are sorry Spunky's gone, but they don't say anything. They must hurt a lot inside.\"\nOh, yes, let us pray for each other and for a pain-racked world.

            "content": "Courage Is the Word for It Mildred Steelman WHEN Margaret stood on the station platform with Stephen and Bill, the numb feeling which had possessed her for days melted away. All the past hectic week she had made plans and decisions, but they had seemed to be for someone else, not for Margaret Jamison and her husband and her son. The salty taste of tears made her swallow. It was no longer just any officer who was going overseas. It was her husband. \"Take care of your mother, Bill,\" Stephen was saying, and his voice had a deep huskiness that Margaret had seldom heard in it. But his words made her upper lip curve into a little crooked smile. \"I will. Dad,\" she heard Bill say. She hadn't realized how tall he was getting, almost as tall as his father. They were shaking hands like two men. Then Stephen had her in his arms. \"God watch between me and thee,\" he said. Margaret hid her face against his chest. Stephen held her close. \"Oh Stephen,\" she said, \"Stephen,\" but she smiled into his eyes. Then the train was under way and he was waving from the vestibule, a tall man with a kindly face and gold oak leaves on his shoulders. Margaret waved frantically and knew that Bill was waving, too. At last she felt the quick pressure of his hand on her arm. \"Let's go. Mom,\" he said jerkily. \"Fm hungry.\" But she read concern for her in his eyes. If only he didn't have to go back to Seattle tonight, but he musn't miss any more time at the university. She was going up there herself in a few days, just as soon as she could wind things up here. Last fall she had leased their home in Seattle in order to be near Stephen. It was wonderful that the tenants were leaving, that she could have the house back. The train was out of sight now, and for the first time she realized that the station was full of people who had come, as she and Bill had come, to say goodbye to their soldier. Instinctively she put her hand up to see that her hat was in place. It was a little red hat and there was charm in the way she wore it. Candor and strength of purpose were in her hazel eyes. \"All right. Bill,\" she said, \"like to drive?\" \"O. K.,\" Bill said, and then, \"Jeepers, there's Sally Sue Crandall, Julia's little sister. Hi, Sally.\" \"Hello,\" she called. \"Wait Bill,\" and Margaret saw her running toward them, her brown curls blowing back from her face. She was out of breath when she reached them. \"Oh,\" she said to Bill, \"I thought you were alone.\" Bill laughed down at her. \"Mother, this is Sally Sue,\" he said. \"I'm glad to meet you, dear,\" Page  Margaret said. Pretty as a picture, she thought, and about thirteen. \"Got any business to be here?\" Bill asked, \"because if you haven't-\" \"You needn't be a meanie,\" Sally Sue pouted. \"Cora had to drive down to Olympia on business and I came along. Cora is my stepmother,\" she explained to Margaret, then her face crinkled into a smile. \"It was dreary waiting at the hotel, but it's fun to watch a troop train leave.\" \"That so?\" Bill said, his voice deep in his throat. \"Gosh, Bill, you've been seeing your dad off.\" Sally Sue's brown eyes filled with tears, \"I'm sorry.\" She's sweet, Margaret thought, and that's all the more reason why she ought to be spanked for hanging around a station. \"O. K., Kid,\" Bill said, \"we'll drop you off at your hotel.\" \"Well, all right, but don't you dare tell Cora or Julia.\" \"Not this time, but if ever again?\" Margaret looked into their serious faces and her throat ached. It didn't seem long since Bill was Sally Sue's age and there were always a lot of things for which he needed to be scolded. And now he was growing up. But she crowded that thought down. At least he had been deferred to continue his engineering course. In the car Sally Sue chatted gaily with an occasional, \"Don't you think so, Mrs. Jamison?\" But Margaret was thinking about Sally Sue's sister. Surely it was just a girl and boy friendship between Julia and Bill. A couple of university kids. The Crandalls lived across the street from Bill's fraternity house. \"Brown study. Mother?\" Bill asked after he had let Sally out. Margaret nodded. At least the child had made her think of someone besides Stephen. Her breath came unevenly. \"Let's get the trunks down before you leave,\" she said. I'll pack half the night, she told herself. I won't let myself think about Stephen. Jyr ARGARET hung the last curtain and stepped back to survey her living room with its deep-toned rug and baby grand piano. \"I don't know any one who can give a room the air of home-like luxury that you ? can,\" Stephen had once said. \"Don't forget I'm a home economics graduate. It's the artistic eye, plus plenty of polish and wax,\" she had laughed\" not realizing how much of the latter it took until she had to apply it herself after a busy morning at the Red Cross office. Not that she minded. She wanted to be working hard to be too tired every night to think. A shadow fell across the doorway. \"Hello, Mom,\" a plaintive voice said, \"got a handout?\" Margaret's eyes lit. She supposed Bill would always have the power to make her smile. He wasn't exactly good looking, but no one could call him homely either. Margaret loved the lean lankiness of him and the little gleam of humor in his eye. \"There are honey cookies in the old jar,\" she said. \"Gosh, Mom, it's swell to be back home.\" \"yYou don't miss the fraternity house too much then?\" \"I'm there plenty as it is. COURAGE IS THE WORD FOR IT 357 A fellow likes to know he's got a home,? Bill said, sitting down at the telephone. One would think he hadn't seen Julia all day, Margaret thought. Momentarily a frown crossed her brow. She must get better acquainted with Julia. \"How about my asking Julia to dinner tomorrow night?\" she asked when Bill hung up. \"Swell.\" Bill draped his long legs over the back of the sofa only to sit up again a little awkwardly. \"I don't know how to say it but you and Julia have just got to like each other.\" Margaret's face flushed crimson. \"I like Julia/ she said. \"Are you trying to say that she doesn't like me?\" \"Of course not. It's just that when you've got a swell mother and a swell girl, you want?\" Margaret felt a little prickly sensation at the back of her neck. Maybe she ought to talk to Julia. The kids musn't get too serious. They were so young. She'd talk to Bill, too, but not tonight. \"You can have Julia over all you want to now I have the house in order,\" she said instead. \"You know me. I like to have someone to keep house for/' Bill got to his feet, put his arm about her. \"No letter yet?\" he asked. \"No letter,\" she said, her voice unsteady. Stephen had been gone a month. It was hard not knowing, not being able to picture him in some particular place. ??# \"I didn't invite you to dinner to ask embarrassing questions, but when Bill was delayed it seemed a good chance for a chat.\" Margaret smiled at the young girl seated opposite her in the little room they called the study. \"I know you didn't,\" Julia said, and stopped. I have upset Julia, Margaret thought, and I didn't mean to. She had brought her in here because the close intimacy of the little room made it seem a place for confidences. The slanting rays of the sun caressed the red geraniums in the window, and made a pool of light at Julia's feet. \"Forgive me,\" Margaret said, and because she couldn't quite help it, \"You are beautiful, dear.\" Julia caught her breath on a half sob. \"I'm not going to pretend that I don't love Bill,\" she said, \"because I do. And,\" she added after a minute, \"he loves me. That's what you want to talk about, isn't it?\" Margaret bit her lip. Julia was refreshingly frank. She wondered whether it was the modern girl or just Julia. She was so sweetly serious yet full of fire and zip, sitting there in the big, blue chair. Her feet barely touched the floor, yet Margaret didn't think of her as little. Her face had the exquisite contour of a cameo, and her fine eyes were looking straight into Margaret's. \"It's because you are both so young, Julia dear,\" Margaret heard herself say. \"Bill and I don't want to be married for a long time.\" Julia's smile was wistful. \"I'd hoped you liked me just a little,\" she said, \"because I adore you. The lump came back into Margaret's throat. \"The girls have a stepmother,? Bill had said. \"She was an actress before she married their dad. They call her Cora. I think she's been more of a mother to Sally Sue than to Julia. If it hadn't been for her little sister, Julia would have been plenty lonesome at home since her father died.\" ?Thank you, dear.\" Margaret smiled at Julia. Bill was sensible really. He and Julia would be all right. There was Bill now. She loved the way he tossed those two unruly curls of his back on his forehead. \"Hello, Julia, hello. Mother,\" he was saying. \"Any mail?\" \"A letter from your dad,\" Margaret said. \"He's in the Philippines.\" Bill's eyes kindled. \"Gosh! That's where I'd like to be. Where's the letter?\" Margaret walked over to her desk, picked up the letter, put it down again. Stephen's first letter. She wanted to read it privately to Bill. \"I wish you knew my dad,\" Bill was saying. \"He's a darn swell guy. Never lets a fellow down.\" The sincerity in Bill's voice clutched at Margaret's heart. \"Here's the letter, dear,\" she said. \"I'll go finish up the dinner.\" She must get over feeling that Julia was an outsider. For her own sake and Bill's and Julia's, too, she must admit her into the inner sanctum of their home. ONCE you let the barriers down there is no putting them up again, Margaret realized as the weeks passed. She didn't want to be selfish, yet she would have liked to have had Bill to herself once in a while, at least. Just because he had been deferred was no reason he would continue to be. Nearly all his friends had gone already. But she crowded down the nagging worry. She didn't know just how long she would have Bill. She never let her thoughts go farther than that. They'll get tired of each other before long at this rate, she told herself one afternoon when Bill insisted on Julia's going down on the avenue with him to get his shoes shined. \"I can always get mine done, too,\" Julia called over her shoulder. Margaret sat down on a low stool beside the radio. She felt her nails pressing into her palms and deliberately folded her hands in her lap. She musn't be like that. Suddenly the music was over and a news analyst came on the air. \"The manpower problem in the army is serious,\" he said. \"Many deferments will not be renewed.\" Margaret felt the tears welling up behind her eyelids. What about Bill? It was time for his name to come before the draft board again. Maybe this time-She was crying when the door opened and Sally Sue burst in. \"Hello, Mrs. Jamison,\" she called, \"is Julie here? No one answered so I-\" \"Oh,\" she said, when she saw Margaret, \"I'm sorry. Cora says I'm always butting in where I have no business.\" Margaret dabbed at her eyes with the tight little ball that was her handkerchief. \"You musn't mind an old woman's tears, dear,\" she said, but her voice shook. Sally Sue stamped her foot. COURAGE IS THE WORD FOR IT 359 \"You're not old. You're young and pretty. Why don't you go on crying?\" She blushed furiously. ?I mean, don't mind me. I'll go away. Oh, here come Julia and Bill now.\" 'There was too much of a line up so we didn't wait.? Julia said. Margaret glanced at her quickly. Why that casual tone? She and Bill hadn't quarreled had they? Julia's face was flushed, her eyes too bright. Bill's, too. \"Oh hello, Sally,\" Julia was saying. 'Is anything the matter at home?\" \"Of course there isn't. I mean why should there be? Say, Julie, can I wear your white dress?\" \"Why, I don't know,\" Julia said doubtfully. \"Where are you go-ing?\" \"Oh, please, Julia, I have to,\" Sally pleaded. \"It's going to be a swell dance. I've got to knock their eyes out.\" \"Whose eyes?\" Bill laughed. Sally Sue looked at him pityingly. \"It's the Explorers. We are having a party at Mutual.\" She threw her arms around Julia's neck. \"Please Julie,\" she said. Margaret swallowed hard. Sally's chatter was giving her a chance to get hold of herself. \"Well, I suppose you can,\" Julia answered. \"When is the dance?\" \"A week from next Friday.\" \"Sort of forehanded aren't you?\" Bill teased. But Sally Sue wasn't listening. \"Oh, thank you, Julie,\" she beamed. \"I'll do something for you sometime.\" She turned to Margaret. \"Goodbye,\" she said. Margaret looked from Julia to Bill when the door closed after Sally Sue. \"What happened while you were gone?\" she asked, and in spite of herself her voice trembled. Bill shot a startied look at Julia. \"We stopped at the post office,\" he said, and pulled a long, official-looking envelope out of his pocket. \"Oh, Bill, your draft summons!\" For a moment the room reeled. Then it had four walls and a ceiling again, and Margaret heard what Bill was saying. \"Oh, Mom.\" There was exultation in his voice. \"Jeepers! I can't tell you how I feel. I've got to help. I've wanted to all. Along.\" Margaret put her hand up to her throat. She had had no idea. It didn't seem possible that Bill wanted to go. She looked at them and tried to overcome the sick feeling at the pit of her stomach. They were both so young and fine. So generous. Bill put one arm around her and one around Julia and it seemed to Margaret that he had grown an inch in the last few minutes. \"I've got to take it in my stride,\" she told herself, and rubbed her hand against Bill's cheek. \"I'm glad you feel the way you do,\" she said aloud. But no amount of remembering that she was a soldier's wife could reconcile Margaret to Bill's being in the army. She poured out her heart in a long letter to Stephen and then didn't send it. I musn't try to put my feelings into words, she thought. It isn't fair to Stephen. Instead she got out a V form. She couldn't say much on that, but it would be enough. In the days that followed, she could only think how young Bill was, how sheltered. How little responsibility he had ever been expected to take. It's a man's army. she told herself, and Bill is just a kid. ?They won't coddle me in the army.? Bill said gruffly one night. Margaret swallowed her tears. She must curb that longing to put her arms around Bill whenever he came home. \"Gosh, Mom, don't take it so hard,\" Bill was saying, ?I'm not a kid. Maybe I was, but I'm not now. Julie sees the difference.\" \"Aren't you spending too much time with Julie?\" Margaret asked and could have bitten her tongue out. \"No,\" Bill said. \"I'm not. Gosh, Mom, I'm going to be away from Julie. I'm going to be away from both of you.\" But it's harder to leave Julie, Margaret's swift thought finished. She musn't be like that. She musn't be jealous of Julia. \"I've got to tell you. Mom,\" Bill was saying, \"I passed my physical.\" \"Oh, Bill!\" Margaret knew she was hanging on desperately to her courage, but she musn't let Bill down. \"I'm glad,\" she said after a minute. Bill pushed back his hair and his young voice soared. \"Gosh, Mom, I'm in the army now.\" LONG before Margaret had time to get an answer from Stephen, Bill was gone. It seemed to her as if the army had opened and swallowed him up. Working all day at the Red Gross office and teaching nutrition three nights a week was important work she knew, but it left her with an aching void. On one particularly lonely evening, she wandered about the study. It had been Bill's playroom when he was a child. In the corner by the window she could still see a whole army of tin soldiers, and over by the radiator ran an electric train. She must see the big blue chair, not these things out of the past, but when she sat down in the chair, Stephen came to play on the floor with little Bill, and together they laid more track. Bill's high trebble mingling with Stephen's deep tones. Then they were gone, and Margaret heard nothing but the ticking of the clock. She didn't want to be sorry for herself. She wanted to make her contribution to the war as much as anyone. But she knew a lot of people whose homes weren't broken up. People who didn't have to look around and say, \"My home is entirely empty now that both my husband and my son are gone. There is no one to keep house for.\" The sharp ringing of the bell broke into her reverie. At the door a messenger handed her a special delivery letter. It was from Bill, and she opened it with one motion. \"Julie and I want to get married,\" he wrote without preamble. \"Julie will talk to you about it. Be an angel and persuade Gora to give her consent.\" Margaret sat staring at the letter, a little frown between her fine brows. They can't do that, she told herself. Hastily she put on a street dress. She'd go and see Gora at once. Together they'd nip this thing in the bud. Bill was just lonesome and homesick. He'd be all right a little later. Surely he and Julia had had no such idea when he went away. He musn't now, she told herself COURAGE IS THE WORD FOR IT 361 for the hundredth time when she rang the Crandall?s bell. Cora came to the door. \"How do you do, Mrs. Jamison?? she said in a low, contralto voice. \"Come over by the fireplace, won't you?\" Cora seated herself opposite her. In her red hostess coat that brought out the almost purple tint in her hair, Margaret couldn't help thinking that she was beautiful. But it was a studied pose she knew as was the huskiness in her voice. \"So the kids want to get married,\" she drawled. \"Well, I've told Julia she's much too young.\" \"They are both too young,\" Margaret said. \"Julie is nearly twenty,\" Cora said, \"but I think she'll realize that she has duties here at home.\" \"Maybe I can talk to her, too,\" Margaret said. It flitted through her mind that perhaps they had no right to interfere in the children's lives. But she put the thought aside. Bill and Julia would thank them for it later. \"You wouldn't conspire against me, would you?\" It was Julia. She came in with a little rush and put her arms around Margaret's neck. \"Bill and I want this so very much,\" she said. \"I'm sorry, dear,\" Margaret began, but Cora cut in crisply, \"Stop putting on an act. You don't know what you want.\" Julia's eyes struck fire. \"I do know,\" she said. \"I know I love Bill and I know he loves me. Margaret knows we meant to wait.\" Her young lips quivered. \"How do we know that there will be a tomorrow for us? Bill may not come back. We have to take our happiness when we can get it.\" Margaret drew her breath in sharply. It was so like the courage of youth to call a spade a spade. When you were older there were thoughts you crowded down, didn't let materialize. \"Bill said his mother would understand,\" Julia was saying. She was standing in front of Margaret now and her young breasts rose and fell stormily. \"I could get a job down there. We could have his week-end leaves together.\" \"I'm sorry, dear,\" Margaret began again. \"Why does everyone have to be like this? If Bill's old enough to fight, he's old enough to get married.\" The door slammed after Julia, and Margaret got slowly to her feet. At home she went disconsolately to bed. Dear Stephen, she thought, I need you to help me. She pulled the blankets more firmly about her, resting her head in the hollow of the pillow, but sleep wouldn't come. She hadn't realized how much she had depended on Stephen. Julia was so young, so tragic. Was Bill feeling the same way? Oh, Stephen, am I right? She breathed. Kok Ok I must stiffen my spine, she told herself the next morning,. Because I'm sure I'm right. Automatically she opened the morning paper. On the front page of the local news a picture caught her eye. It was Cora Crandall and under it the caption, \"Former Actress Joins Theatrical Troupe. Cora Bedford Crandall Will Tour Army Camps.\" Margaret sat staring at it. How can she leave Sally Sue? She thought. But of course she can if Julia is there. Relief flooded over her. That's what Cora meant about duties at home. It was going to work out. She wouldn't have to write to Bill and seem to interfere. But she had reckoned without her own warm heart. It was late afternoon when Julia came to see her. '1 don't know anyone to talk to but you,\" she said. She had the morning paper in her hand and her eyes were red. '1 can't go away and leave Sally Sue.\" Margaret stifled a quick desire to take Julia in her arms and comfort her. \"Cora is planning to leave,\" she heard herself say. \"Cora is just Cora. I'm Sally Sue's big sister.\" Julia's face worked. '1 shouldn't have made plans to go away.\" Margaret felt as if her heart were turning over. Here was someone strong and courageous, able to face life. Bill was courageous, too, doing a man's part. Suddenly she held out her arms to Julia. \"Do you think Sally Sue would be happy here with me?\" she asked. V.E. Day Observed PRESIDENT TRUMAN told the nation in a broadcast at 9 a.m. E. W. T., Tuesday, May 8, 1945, ?This is a solemn but a glorious hour. General Eisenhower informs me that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations. The flags of freedom fly over all Europe.\" This declaration brought some comfort and hope to the mothers of the United States; however, faced with the rising fury of a continuing ' war against Japan, no mother could fully rejoice in view of the cruel and heartrending days lying ahead. President Truman also set aside Sunday, May 13, as a day of national prayer, and said that it is eminently fitting that the day of prayer should also be Mother's Day. To the liberated countries of Europe and to the United Kingdom where the terrible ravages of war have been experienced, Victory-Europe Day meant a blessed deliverance from the acts of an oppressor; but to the citizens of our nation whose shores have been free from hostilities, V-E Day was only a day of observance to commemorate the end of one theatre of war?only a marker along the path of peace whose'end cannot yet be glimpsed by mortal eyes. In the heavy hearts of Latter-day Saints, too, is the sure knowledge that lasting peace will not abide on the earth until the nations, in reality and not merely in name, become Christian nations? until repentance, entering into the hearts of men, dictates the acts of nations. When that day dawns then indeed will it be a glorious day. M. C. S."

            "content": "LIVING SAFELY AT HOME Nellie O. Parker Former Member of Relief Society General Board Chairman Home Safety Division, Utah Safety Council HOME is quite generally considered the safest place in the world. \"Safe at home\" is an axiom in everyday usage. But, paradoxically, accidents which occur in the home, cause as many injuries as all other types of accidents combined, and home accidents cause more deaths than any other type of accident. These fatalities and injuries result in an enormous waste of life and limb, a staggering economic loss, and entail sorrow and suffering that never can be measured. They wreck savings and bank accounts; bring in their train poverty, hardship, and discomfort; and increase charity demands. Hospital beds are filled with such sufferers, and the care of nurses is required that is sorely needed for sick and wounded servicemen. According to the National Safety Council, in 1944 there were 30,500 persons killed in home accidents; there were 4,600,000 others injured, with a monetary cost of $550,000,000. Statistics for Utah for the same period show that every second day a home in Utah suffered the tragedy of an accidental death. Every month there were fifteen victims whose lives could have been saved by a little extra foresight, a little extra carefulness, a little extra attention to commonplace dangers in the home. No normal person wants to have an accident. His inborn instinct of self preservation and his desire to carry forward his plans and daily activities are thwarted when one occurs. It is important that every individual, especially a parent, be made conscious of the unsafe conditions that may exist in his home as well as habits of living which may produce accidents. Everyone should feel a personal responsibility to safeguard his life and those of others?especially little children. No little child should lose his life or become maimed or crippled if foresight and attention can prevent it. Little children need constant surveillance to see that they are getting sufficient air to prevent smothering, that they do not fall or get burned, etc. Everyone should learn to recognize a hazard in a loose fixture or frayed electric cord, a faulty furnace flue, or a pan of hot water set too near the edge of the stove; to foresee in a protruding nail, a dark cluttered stairway or an attic full of rubbish, a cause for an injury or a fire. And not only should he recognize the hazard but he should correct it. \"Safety,\" says the National Safety Council, \"is a rule for living for every individual, and it must be made a part of every human activity.? Page  Safety is efficiency, it is good housekeeping. It is intehigent to keep things in order, in their proper places and in good repair. It is safe, as well as good housekeeping, to keep grease, water or ice off the floor; to keep brooms, mops, etc., stored away in closets to prevent falls. Oily dustclothes should be kept in closed containers to avoid spontaneous combustion. Inflammable liquids, such as gasoline, should not be used for cleaning. This epitaph might apply to too many: Here lie the remains of Lizzie Green, She cleaned her dress in gasoline. Even though one may have performed a risky act without mishap once, it does not mean that luck will always be with him. It has been proved that an unsafe practice will eventually result in an accident. CHILDREN should be taught safe habits from babyhood?to eat or drink only those things given to them as food; to put their toys away; to climb only when it is safe; to avoid touching electric outlets or extension plugs. Sharp instruments such as knives, scissors, hatchets, etc., should be kept out of reach of children until they are old enough to handle them safely. If children, as well as adults, are trained in habits of safety, they can proceed to their daily activities without the lurking danger of an accident. Poisons should be kept out of reach and not in the bathroom medicine chest. They should also be marked in a distinctive way such as having a pin stuck in the cork. Old medicines should not be thrown into waste baskets where children might get them, nor should similar bottles be kept side by side, especially if one contains cough medicine and the other a benzoit compound for the croup kettle. Hurrying or quick, hasty movements are often the cause of bodily injury or death. If one feels anxiety, emotional stress or illness, the individual is often not as careful or alert to hazards as he normally would be. It is a safe practice, therefore, to avoid undue haste, to try to keep calm under all conditions, and to try to use common sense at all times. To prevent accidents should be a prime objective of everyone, but as human beings are prone to err, it is also important to know the fundamentals of first aid, and to have a working knowledge of home nurs; ing so that life may be saved if an accident does occur. The Accident Prevention course being given by the American Red Cross will prove helpful to the housewife who, because of her position in the home, can best be its safety engineer. It will help her to recognize unsafe conditions as well as unsafe practices in her own home. Strive to live safely at home by being prepared: first, to recognize or anticipate a hazard; second, to repair or eliminate the danger; third, to cultivate and form safe habits; and fourth, to keep a good first-aid kit close at hand."

            "content": "Daughters and Heirs Grace S. Cozzens CHRISTIE GLENN DAVIS sat at the head of the table, hostess to her three widowed sisters-in-law, all self-respecting widows, not a grass among them. The mirror, opposite Christie, reflected a slender, reddish-haired woman in a smoke-gray dress that matched her wistful eyes. For quite some time she had been planning this little dinner for just the four of them, in her apartment of carved woods and wrought iron. She felt little shooting pains of fear. Not that the meal would fail to please?. No, she hadn't forgotten that Ella was especially fond of baked ham, that Olive liked broiled squab, and that Amanda's favorite dessert was lemon pie. The meal was planned to please. To open the way. And she must watch for the right opening and take it when it came. She helped Ella to a serving of ham?Ella, that buxom girl of nineteen who had married Daniel twenty years ago. Dan, handsome, vital, had led Ella a dance, until Dad Glenn deeded him, his eldest son, a third of his perfectly cultivated ranch, and Dan had settled down to farming and fathering a family. Christie noticed Ella had grown older by eight or ten inches around the mid-section, though she still had the serene face of a madonna, with her soft gray eyes, and brown hair parted in the middle and knotted at the back of her neck. But her meek look belied her brisk, chuckle-filled speech. Ella owned that part of the farm next to the river. The old Bear River on which Christie had rowed, in which she had waded, by which she had picnicked when a child, and on whose sandbars she had lain full-length beside its warm, swashy waters?the old river with its never-ending theme story and song. A Swiss bronze clock on the mantel loosed a series of soft silvery chimes. \"How grand!\" Olive exclaimed. \"Oh, I'd give anything for a clock like that.\" \"Golly, yes!\" Ella chuckled. Across the table Christie was watching. Why couldn't it have been Amanda who admired the clock? It was Manda she wanted to bargain clocks with. But practical Manda said nothing. It naturally would be Olive?Olive exquisitely gowned in folds of georgette and lace, her flaxen, fluffy curls and red lips reminding one of a fancy figurine. Olive had been a brideybride, but had proved to be a tyrannical wife and a resentful widow, when Lee had succumbed to a sudden heart attack. She was a feverish sort. Always wanting things she couldn't have?never satisfied with things that were hers. Olive and her four children lived in the big ranch house, with its dozens of windows, six verandas, and many rooms and closets?all crowded with memories of the Glenn family. Page  Amanda, Jed's wife and the last to wear the widow's weeds, sat at the foot of the table. Hazel-eyed and thin, she was a little woman with a fighting chin. There was something solid and real about her. The auto crash that took Jed had left a little scar across, her cheek. She and Christie had gone to school together, and Amanda had often come to their house and played on the very spot of ground where Mandy's house now stood, surrounded by vast flower beds. Christie knew each rock and rill of it. Every nook where the Johnny-jump-ups and the wild bluebells came first in the spring. And the summits beyond that pierced the azure sky ?Christie knew every peak. ISN?T this the grandest meal?\" Ella chuckled. \"There's no such thing as beating Chris cooking.\" 'That's right,\" Amanda said in her thin, firm voice. \"Our grandmothers might have beat her piecing and spinning, but not cooking.\" Christie's heart skipped a beat. Here was an opening She rushed into it. \"Don't flatter me, giris,\" she smiled shyly. \"But speaking of spinning? whatever became of my grandmother's old spinning wheel? Dad left it up in the barn loft where you live, Olive. Is it still there?\" \"No-o,\" Olive drawled, accepting a cup of cocoa. \"After Lee died the kids got it down. They have it in their playhouse.\" 'Tlayhouse?\" Christie repeated. \"It's too frail, Olive. A long time ago my grandmother brought it across the ocean with her?and across the plains.\" \"That's none of my business,\" Olive laughed softly. \"But, Olive, its a keepsake. It's over a hundred years old.\" \"That's just it,\" Olive said. \"Who wants the old thing under her feet?\" She lifted her fork elegantly to her lips. \"A spoke or two are missing, but the girls still spin on it. And they have a good time.\" A frantic little horror rose in Christie's bosom. A spoke or two missing! There came to her, across the years, a picture of her little grandmother in her billowy skirts and lacy cap, sitting at the spinning wheel in the corner of the old log house on the Glenn farm, her small feet deftly treading. The wheel was whirling?fibers of wool twirling into yarn. And all the while the little old lady was telling the children stories of her long trip across the Atlantic. Two months, she'd told them, she and her three children had been in a sailboat with a few clothes and the old spinning wheel. \"That is,\" she had said, \"I left the old country with three, but I buried my baby in the ocean.\" She would tell them that their grandpa had died in Denmark, and that his last words to her had been: \"Sell everything and take the children to Utah.\" She had sold everything but the old spinning wheel. Christie's eyes grew bright. They met Olive's. \"Tell the girls,\" she said, appealingly, \"that Auntie will buy them any toys they choose, if they will let her have the spinning wheel.\" \"No,\" Olive said, without looking up from boning her squab. \"No. I wouldn't do that. It would be cheating you. And the girls are satisfied with it.\" They all began chatting pleasantly again. Christie couldn't believe she'd failed. She musn't fail. She must beg for it. DAUGHTERS AND HEIRS 367 \"Fd like so much to have it, Ohve/\" she said earnestly. 'T'll pay you well for it.\" \"Pay me for it?\" Olive laughed. \"Tou should see it. The old thing is about ready to drop to pieces. It's not worth anything.\" \"It is to me,\" Christie said. \"Well, the girls like it and I wouldn't ask them to part with it,\" Olive smiled lazily. \"For Ian' sakes, Chris, lay off!\" Ella giggled. Christie nodded. She musn't risk petty argument. It was understood, among all of them, that she had no rights about the farm where she had been born and reared, and where the three others now lived. The sons had inherited that. But if she could only make them somehow realize she was a part. Her underlying wishes did not represent a very great stake. There was a broader ?a more fundamental want... Now the sons and heirs were all gone... She passed the jam to Ella. \"Father gave his sword to Dan,\" she said. \"I wonder if you still have it, Ella?\" \"Yes. It's still sticking around.\" \"And has it ever been unsheathed?\" Christie asked. \"You know, dad said he never wanted it unsheathed.\" She smiled a little proudly. \"He said it with the grandeur and maje'y of an old soldier who had known the rigors of the battle field: \"That sword has never been thrust nor unsheathed since the day the* Yankees won. And I never want it misused.\"\" Christie looked directly at Ella. \"Has it been?\" \"Has it been?\" Ella laughed. \"Bob and Gil use it to fence with. Bob made a wooden one to go with it. You should see them parry and prime.\" Christie winced. \"Isn't a sword a pretty dangerous weapon for boys to fence with?\" \"Oh, no,\" Ella replied lightly. \"I made them break the point off.\" Christie jumped up and began clearing the table for the dessert. \"Would you mind selling me what is left of it?\" she asked abruptly. Ella's mouth curved into a possessive smile. \"You may as well cry for the moon, as to ask them to give it up. \"Do you think they would part with it for a brace of new foils?\" \"I'm afraid not,\" Ella answered. \"Besides, if it means that much to you, it means that much to me. Your dad gave that old saber to Dan and his boys are going to keep it.\" Again, Christie nodded. Another bit of hope crumpled. Her stormy gray eyes met Olive's cool blue eyes. \"Somewhere in the closet under the stairs in the old farmhouse, there is a powder horn, a bullet mold, and a couple of soldier caps with tiny brass guns crossed in front...\" \"They're all smashed to smithereens long ago,\" Olive said. Christie placed the dessert before her guests and refilled their glasses, while they chatted about things about the farm and their children. Her hands trembled. She sat down and braced herself for a last question, the last but by no means the least. She exchanged looks with Amanda. Then slowly she spoke. \"Manda, when the folks grew too old to manage the farm and turned it over to their sons and came to live with me, mother told me she left the family clock with Jed, since he was her oldest living child. You remember, it was of brown wood about a foot tall.\"\n\"Sure I remember it,\" Amanda nodded.\nChristie's voice lowered reminiscently. \"It had a rounded top, with a full glass door. On the lower half, a yellow pointer dog was painted in the center of a blue circle. . . .\"\n\"And the pendulum swung from the point of his nose to the tip of his tail,\" Amanda interrupted. \"We used to watch it when we were kids.\"\n\"Is it still there, Manda?\"\n\"Sure,\" Amanda said. \"But I haven't a shelf for it. Some day I'll get one and have the old ticker antiqued, and get a new hand for it and see if it will keep time.\"\n\"A new hand?\" Christie breathed out. \"What happened?\"\nAmanda tinkered with her water glass. \"One day I happened to set it on a chair and along came Sammy and picked off the minute hand. I could'a whipped 'im.\"\n\"Couldn't you have had it put back on?\"\n\"He broke it,\" Amanda scoffed. \"And I threw it in the garbage can.\"\nCHRISTIE'S attention slipped away from her guests. Once again through feverish eyes she was watching the minute hand. She was in her mother's big four-poster bed swathed in blankets in an attempt to break a fever. She was fretting and watching the big hand slowly count off the long minutes until the blankets could gradually be taken off. . . . Heat pricked at her temples. That old minute hand had chronicled every event of the Glenn family. It had recorded the births of the five babies. Timed their growth. Got them to school on time. Measured the long hours and the last moments to the heartbroken family around the death bed of little Jack, an early victim of appendicitis. It had marked the beginning of her wedding reception, and finally had pointed to the hour when she said goodbye to her family and the farm and had followed Dick, a young naval officer, on his uncharted course about the world. She'd lived in many a port and had remained in one place only during the time her parents had spent their last years with her. As from a distance, she saw her guests folding their napkins. Goose flesh crept over her like a rash.\n\"Amanda,\" she said a little huskily, \"now that Jed is gone, do you mind letting me have the family clock?\" She glanced at the mantel. \"I'll get you a new one, and save it all the way from Switzerland.\"\n\"Why should I?\" Amanda asked politely.\n\"Do you think it's too much for me to want the old family clock?\"\nAmanda's jaw set. \"I sure do. Your ma gave that clock to Jed, and it's never going to leave Jed's family.\"\nThere was a moment of oppressive silence, then the three widowed sisters-in-law began exchanging good-natured gibes among themselves.\n\"She's a good cook all right,\" Ella chuckled. \"But imagine the selfish gal trying to get our keepsakes away from us.\"\n\"Heirlooms,\" Christie countered. DAUGHTERS AND HEIRS \"Maybe I am selfish, since I have memories of them that none of you have. Maybe I did have my nerve asking?expecting?-since sons are heirs.\" The hour finally came when the guests began to take their leave. With a tired, let-down feeling, Christie escorted her kinswomen to the entrance hall to say goodbye. As they entered the sunroom a little red bird ran out from a rustic clock and mechanically \"cuckooed\" the hour of five. \"Oh, Chris!\" Olive cried with delight. \"Where in the world did you get it? I'd give anything for a clock like that.\" Christie looked bewildered. \"Even the old spinning wheel?\" \"Even the old spinning wheel!\" Olive exulted. \"The kids would be crazy over it.\" Christie quietly placed the cuckoo clock in Olive's out-stretched hands. Amanda pursed her thin lips. \"That's not fair,\" she shrugged, \"giving Olive a gift from your swell apartment, and not us.\" Olive held the clock proudly. \"Thanks, Chris,\" she shrilled. Christie looked at Amanda. \"Name your gift,\" she said softly. Amanda scanned the room warily. Christie hinted, \"How about the pair of love birds in the gilded cage? \"The what?\" Amanda raised a skeptical brow. Christie pointed toward the window. \"See,\" she said, \"the darling little blue and green love birds.\" Amanda frowned. \"Oh, no,\" she scoffed. \"Our old cottonwood trees are full of squawking birds. 369 But, that gorgeous fuchsia with the red and purple bells?\" \"Yours for the asking,\" Christie interrupted. Her hands were a little unsteady as she held the potted plant toward Manda. Amanda took it gingerly. \"I guess you'll want the old clock in its place,\" she said. Christie nodded. Amanda laid her cheek against a bloom. \"Well, that suits me all right.\" Ella drew herself as erect as her chubby legs would allow. \"Lan' sakes,\" she sighed, \"what do I get? The boys will take a duck-fit when you two march in with your gifts from Chris, after her trips around the world.\" \"What are you waiting for, Sis?\" Christie smiled. \"Choose!\" Mia laughed softly. \"I'm too decent a person to mention what I?d like.\" Her eager glance shot across the room, touching a miniature aquarium. \"But, I?m all wound up over?well, I won't say, but I know the boys'd trade the old saber in a minute.\" With quiet grimness, Christie handed the fish bow] to Ella. \"Relax,\" she smiled. \"Oh, Chris, how did you ever guess?\" she gasped. \"What are they, anyway? You must tell me how to feed them.\" \"They are guppies,\" Christie said, \"and here are the foods and directions in full for their care.\" \"Goopies,\" Ella repeated, caressing the bowl. In the vanishing daylight Christie sat alone. \"Bless 'em,\" she murmured as she watched the car with (Concluded on page 372)"

            "content": "Sand-Pile Advantages Alice Whitson Norton MRS. BARKER, standing at the kitchen door overlooking her neighbor's back yard, frowned when she saw a small truck back up and dump a load of sand in Betty Jane's old sand pit. She could think of ever so many other things that would be far more delightful for her own little child than a sand pile. All the morning as she went about her household tasks, she kept thinking about the big load of sand in her neighbor's back yard, and finally, when Mrs. Draper came running in to borrow a cup of sugar, she turned upon her in surprise. \"I?ve been wondering all the morning,\" she said frankly, \"just why you had all that sand piled in the back yard.\" \"There's only one excuse for a sand pile,\" laughed Mrs. Draper. \"The children in the neighborhood like it.\" \"To me, that's just the trouble. It's like a bread crumb dropped near an ant hill.\" \"You mean it brings all the children running to it?\" asked Mrs. Draper. \"Exactly,\" returned Mrs. Barker. \"And that's where the rub comes in.\" \"That's altogether in the way you view it.\" \"What do you mean?\" Mrs. Barker asked thoughtfully. \"I mean,\" Mrs. Draper answered, \"that a sand pile furnishes not only healthy amusement, but encourages industry and unselfishness. Now take my child, for instance. Page 370 Betty Jane has practically everything she wants, hence the tendency to develop selfishness could easily be hers. So I fill the sand box with sand, then to that I add blocks of various sizes, nails, small hammers, trowels and small shovels, and a few pieces of screening and tin, and instruct Betty Jane to divide these things among her playmates when they come to play, and to respect the corners given them. In this way she learns to make use of a few things and the joy of sharing, besides. Many a successful builder, architect, and engineer has found his talent in a sand pile.\" After this little lecture, Mrs. Draper reached for the cup of sugar and turned to go home. \"I forgot to tell you,\" she called back over her shoulder, \"I needed this sugar to sweeten some cookies I'm stirring up for the children.\" Mrs. Barker glanced out at the sand pile where busiest among the young engineering group was her own young son, industriously cutting a channel diagonally across the plot allotted him. \"Funny,\" she mused, \"how some people can see so much in a sand pile while others see nothing.\" And then she lifted her hand and tapped lightly on the windowpane, a signal the two neighbors used in calling to each other. Mrs. SAND-PILE ADVANTAGES 371 Instantly Mrs. Draper's bright face was peeping through the glass. \"I'm making lemonade,\" Barker called pleasantly, \"to go with her neighbor had caught a glimpse those cookies?sort of a celebration of the vision she had, went back to in honor of the sand pile.\" the job of cookie-making with a And Mrs. Draper, feeling at last happy smile on her face. The 115th Annual General Conference (Continued from page 329) or intellectual matters, but we do have the invincible truth. Civilization is not wealth or numbers. It is the appreciation of human brotherhood and the. Ceaseless pursuit of real justice. War is the outward sign of inner spiritual decay. Give tireless watch-care to our boys. When they are around, they may be a \"pain in the neck,\" but when they are gone, they are a pain in the heart. Nothing has strengthened my faith more than seeing the gospel in action in the lives of our men in the service. Chastity strengthens man. It is the source of peace and happiness in the home. I like to think of life as beginning before mortality and enduring beyond death. Don't substitute money for welfare assignments. Hungry saints in Europe can't eat money earmarked sugar or beef. They need real sugar, beef, cheese, flour, and butter. I could not believe in a God who would be so unjust as to punish those who die without knowledge of his teachings. We must gain light and truth to go on toward Godhood. Those who oppose profitable evil or popular fallacy are always misunderstood. I know that Christ founded his Church in this day through his prophet. If we come to the Lord with contrite hearts and humble spirits, we cannot fail. The Church of Christ is great in purpose, in leadership, and in historical background. Probably no section hand in the United States but thinks he could run the railroad better than its president. Some inexperienced people, too, think they could guide the Church. While not accountable for things we cannot know, we are held for ignorance which but for sloth might have been dispelled.. Oh, that people had a fraction of the faith in the prophets that they have in the doctors. Whoever receives or rejects the living servants of the Lord receives or rejects the Lord. It is in adversity and sorrow the spirit grows strongest. The gospel teaches me that I am a son of God and a brother of Jesus Christ and therefore of most noble ancestry. And For Eternity {Continued horn page 343) bit of my mind. I daresay he puts more than half the work on you because you're young and willing. Don't you let him do it, Delsa. You stick up for your rights.\" She went slowly out of the room, leaving the door ajar, and Delsa thought. It doesn't matter. I can't sleep anyway. All I can do is lie here and think of Hugh and of what I can never have.\" She turned her head on the pillow and the tears came softly and silently from under her closed lids and drenched the white case. And Delsa didn't know when sleep came and dried her tears and stopped the endless, futile questioning of her heart. (To he continued) We'll Live Those Days Again (Continued from page 337) as they were held and just where they were held, in 1847. Nearby residents in all sections will be invited to participate. Then, too, there will be the arrival, at the mouth of Emigration canyon. Salt Lake City, of this momentous caravan, on the exact day ?100 years later ?when the original pioneers arrived. There will be other events, too, but, like the rest, plans for them must be held in abeyance?or in reserve. They may be used only if they are possible under war conditions. But a program is being worked out. What it will be is not yet known. It will be appropriate, however, for the glory of the occasion. It will live up to the traditions of Utah, as far as is possible, and will direct national attention to the State's most important event?the Centennial of its discovery and settlement by Brigham Young and the original pioneers. Among the plans tentatively made are: Issuance by the U. S. Government of a Utah Centennial stamp for nation-wide distribution. Approval and issuance by the U. S. Government for permits for a Utah Centennial cachet. Approval by the U. S. Government of a cancellation stamp telling of the Utah Centennial. Recital of incidents in Utah history through national magazines and newspaper syndicates. Development of Utah's cultural activities; such as dramas, pageants, and other enterprises. Development of Utah's scenic, recreational, vacation and sports possibilities through the promotion of events to attract national publicity. Development of national publicity for the State. Depending upon conditions, some of these plans may be fully realized, and others developed to a lesser degree; but as war conditions permit, the Utah Centennial will be celebrated to its fullest possible extent.

Sec. 2. (e) The flag should be displayed daily weather permitting, on or near the main administration building of every public institution.... Sec. 3. (g) When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another in time of peace.... (1) When the flag is displayed otherwise than by being flown from a staff, it should be displayed flat, whether indoors or out, or so suspended that its folds fall as free as though the flag were staffed.... (k) When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, if it is displayed in the chancel of a church, or on the speaker's platform in a public auditorium, the flag should occupy the position of honor and be placed at the clergyman's or speaker's right as he faces the congregation or audience. Any other flag so displayed in the chancel or on the platform should be placed at the clergyman's or speaker's left as he faces the congregation or audience. But when the flag is displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium elsewhere than in the chancel or on the platform it shall be placed in the position of honor at the right of the congregation or audience as they face the chancel or platform. Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the congregation or audience as they face the chancel or platform.... Sec. 4- (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise. (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free. (d) The flag should never be used as drapery of any sort whatsoever, never festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of a platform, and for decoration in general. (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as will permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way. Page 373 (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling. (g) The flag should never have placed upon it' nor on any part of it* nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature. (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything. (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard; or used as any portion of a costume or athletic uniform. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown. (j) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning. Sec. 5. That during the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag, stand at attention, and salute.

That the pledge of allegiance to the flag, \"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,\" be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart. However, civilians will always show full respect to the flag when the pledge is given by merely standing at attention, men removing the headdress. Persons in uniform shall render the military salute.... BOUND VOLUMES THOSE desiring to have their 1944 issues of Thebound, may do so through the office of the General Board.

RELIEF SOCIETY AND CHURCH WELFARE SEWING Bear River Stake (Utah) MAUDE O. COOK, president of this stake Relef Society, wrote in July 1944: \"We have completed and sent to the Northern Utah Region 17 layettes, 162 boys' shirts, 23 ladies' dresses and housecoats, 24 children's dresses, 33 ladies' aprons, 33 panties, 274 dish towels, 120 hand-hemmed handkerchiefs, 155 pillow slips, 13 sheets, and we have on hand finished or partly so 33 women's nightgowns, 19 ladies' slips, 13 pairs of men's pajamas, and 50 pillowslips. Accompanying is a photo of the Tremonton Second Ward Relief Society work meeting held the second Tuesday of June. The meeting began at 9 a. M. And continued until 5 P. M.; dinner was served at noon. Eighty-three women were present. They made 28 women's nightgowns for the welfare project, and for the ward a number of aprons for a contemplated bazaar, finished 2 layettes, 2 quilts, and a number of dish towels, and cut and sewed 20 pounds of rags for rugs. A similar meeting was held by the Garland Relief Society during the month of May at which 60 women were present.\" All-day work meeting held June 13, 1944, by the Tremonton Second Ward, Bear River Stake.

In the picture are the stake Relief Society executive officers under whose direction this assignment was filled; left to right: Lorena W. Anderson, then counselor in charge of work and now president; Amy B. Towler, retiring president; Leone G. Layton, counselor who in June had been appointed to the General Board of Relief Society; and Cacia Margetts, secretary-treasurer, retained by the new president. Picture of another part of this stake's assignment appeared in the Magazine for March 1945, page 130, as an illustration for the article \"The Relief Society in Church Welfare\" by Elder Marion G. Romney, Assistant Managing Director of the General Church Welfare Committee. Wells Stake (Utah) LORENA W. ANDERSON, president of Wells Stake Relief Society, wrote last July of the 1944 welfare sewing assignment which was completed while she was serving as counselor in charge of work, under direction of Amy B. Towler, then president. \"When we received this assignment it seemed almost an impossibility to fill it under war conditions. We considered it a very large order, but we divided it and gave each one of our eight wards an equal amount. Our loyal, faithful ward presidents accepted their quota in the proper spirit, and with their Relief Society members soon were busy and very interested. 'The layettes were daintily handmade, trimmed with silk crochet edgings, laces, and buttons which could not be purchased today but which were furnished by the sisters. Our children's dresses were an expression of individual style and trim, which made them very attractive. Our misses' and women's dresses were also individually patterned and well made. All our purchased materials were as good as the market affords today, including sheets, pillow cases, and dish towels. \"In unity there is strength. Our sisters were united and willing to work many extra days, and did so with a spirit of love and co-operation, with the feeling that 'it is better to give than to receive.? NOTES FROM THE FIELD 377 A few of the 1200 coats and jackets for boys and girls being made from used coats by the Relief Societies of the Northern Utah Region as a part of the 1945 clothing assignment of the Church Welfare Program. This project is under direction of Reka Parker, chairman of the women's work directors of this Region and counselor in charge of work in the South Ogden Stake Relief Society. In the picture are Orval Dean, Regional Coordinator, and Pearl McArthur who receives the finished clothing at the storehouse.  Never before in our stake has there been greater enthusiasm for the work meeting. This we attribute to the joy the women have received in contributing to the great Church Welfare Program.\" Northern Utah Region (Ogden) REKA PARKER, chairman of the women's work directors of this Church Welfare region, and counselor in charge of work in the South Ogden Stake Relief Society, reported April 1, 1945: \"One of the 1945 Church Welfare clothing assignments for the Northern Utah Region is the making of 1200 coats and jackets from old used coats. 'The used coats are procured from the Deseret Industries in Ogden and Salt Lake City. Women from the Region carefully examine and select the coats to be used. The coats are cleaned at the Deseret Industries, and upon their return are sorted again according to sizes and styles, counted, and distributed to the stakes and wards for ripping apart and pressing, ready for cutting. In the Northern Utah Region there are 15 stakes with 128 wards, so the coats are distributed in proportion to the assignment of each stake which is governed by its population. \"Uniform styles and patterns have been selected for boys' and girls' coats and jackets, and each stake is assigned a large and a small size to make for either a boy or a girl.

Allred, president of Provo Stake Relief Society.) \"Brother John Christiansen, a well-known tailor with 37 years of experience, kindly consented to give some demonstrations and a set of simplified instructions on the cutting and making of melton jackets to the stake Relief Society women's work directors. Later on. Brother Christiansen gave a demonstration on the lining and padding of coats for girls. Two demonstrations have been held, attended by Relief Society women from the distant Lyman and Woodruff stakes as well as the other stakes of the Region. One little woman waited in a bus depot until 3 A. M. Rather than leave by an earlier bus before the demonstration was over. Two other women were given beds in the storehouse so that they might remain to see all of the demonstration. \"These stake leaders in turn held like demonstrations for their ward women's work directors. The ward leaders were asked to instruct accordingly the women who did the cutting and sewing. Written instructions have been prepared by Louisa T. Scoffield, counselor in the Weber Stake Relief Society, and two copies given to every ward women's work director in the Region. \"Seven hundred of these coats are now distributed. Many are finished and the rest in preparation for cutting and sewing. Women have taken many of the light-colored ones home, ripped them apart and laundered them in mild soap flakes, which has greatly improved their appearance. \"All buttons, linings, and inter-linings are saved and used again if possible. Binding tape, thread, and some new linings are furnished by the Regional Welfare Committee.\" NOTES FROM THE FIELD 379 The stake Relief Society presidency and women of the Springdale Ward taking their turn at the lovely new sewing room on the second floor of the Burley Stake storehouse. Agnes C. Hoggan, stake Relief Society president, reports that this sewing room was completed last August and has been in operation since then.

At the left are Counselors Margaret Hansen and Norma Johnson; President Naomi Ruud, center; and Secretary Treasurer Thora Rawson, right. Boise Stake (Idaho) OFFICERS of the Boise First Ward Relief Society submitted the following account of their very successful bazaar: \"The Relief Society bazaar of the Boise First Ward was held December 7, 1944 in the ward recreation hall with much enthusiasm and success. Eight months previous, at the April work meeting, the members unanimously voted in favor of having an outstanding event sometime in the late fall and they co-operated wholeheartedly toward this end during the several months of preparation. Committees were appointed by the executives for the following booths: Art work?which included a display of pillow cases, luncheon sets, tea towels, crocheted articles, etc. Apron?Over one hundred aprons were made by the members for this booth. Baby?'This booth consisted of articles for baby layette, including two satin quilts. Children's pajamas and dresses, stuffed animals and dolls were also on display. Quilt?Twelve quilts were made by the quilt committee, including two beautiful satin quilts. Cake?Fifty cakes were donated and sold at this booth. Candy?One hundred and twenty pounds of candy were made by a special candy committee. The sugar was donated in small quantities by the sisters of the ward. \"Chili was sold at the end of the evening after a floor show presented by the dancing school was enjoyed by the 800 people in attendance. \"Articles and materials were NOTES FROM THE FIELD 381 purchased by the Society and were made up by the members. \"Proceeds from the sale of the many fine articles on display amounted to approximately $700.\" Ensign Stake (Utah) LEONE O. JACOBS, counselor in the Ensign Stake Relief Society, of which Alice B. Steinicke is president, wrote in November 1944: \"For several years since the division of the ward, the South 18th Ward Relief Society had been in need of additional storage space. One small closet was the only available nook for the numerous and varied supplies. During 1942, first-aid kits and emergency supplies were required to be on hand in every ward, in case of disaster. In 1943 came the Church Welfare bedding project which called for huge bundles of cotton and wool batts, more quilt frames, and materials. Confusion and disorder reigned in the closet. It was impossible to know where each article was and to keep it accessible. If quilt blocks, for example, were wanted, it might take half an hour fumbling through piles of materials, stepping over sewing machines and other equipment, to find them. \"The Bishop was consulted and he and the Relief Society presidency (Sisters Zilpha Bramwell, Lorene Chamberlain, and Agnes Manookin) toured the rooms and hallways adjacent to Relief Society quarters with a view to adding another closet. Several places were discussed and rejected because of price or unsuitability. Vilate R. Ivins, secretary of the South 20th Ward Relief Society, Ensign Stake, is shown at the cupboard which she had built in the Relief Society room as a memorial to her mother, Emma P. Romney, now passed away, who had served as a president of the old Twentieth Ward Relief Society. Picture taken in 1944. Sister Ivins says: \"The cupboard is 8 1/2 feet high, 16 feet long, and 22 inches deep. It has 103 feet of shelf space, 20 inches deep. The long shelves are 11 inches apart. We were told not to put the shelves too far apart. It is better to have more shelves than to overload them. \"The cupboard adds to the beauty of the room. The room is also used as a banquet room so the Bishop was fearful at first that it might be in the way, but it is not. After two years of use, we find it is adequate in every detail.\" Storage Cupboards, South 18th Ward Relief Society, Ensign Stake. Inset shows lid to upper section where quilt frames and first-aid splints and stretchers are stored. Finally, Sister Chamberlain, welfare counselor, conceived the idea of building cabinets under the windows along the east wall of the Relief Society room. The windows are high above the floor. This suggestion seemed very practical and everyone agreed to it. Plans were drawn and not many weeks passed before the cupboards were completed. Not only do they adequately solve the storage problem, but they add charm and individuality to the room. The maple finish of the cabinets matches the woodwork, showing the beautiful grain of the wood. \"Not being sure that one width of the room would allow sufficient space, the cabinet was extended part way down the south wall. The top of the cabinet opens up with a lid and here are placed horizontally the quilt frames, also splints and stretchers for first-aid kit. Below are shelves and drawers to meet every demand. Attractive window curtains come just to the top of the cabinet, and potted plants, spaced at intervals, add to the general effect of the room. Such a pleasing arrangement could be adopted by other ward Relief Societies.\" SPECIAL ACTIVITIES North Sanpete Stake (Utah) wrote in October 1944: PEARLE M. OLSEN, president of this stake Relief Society wrote in October 1944: \"For about eight years this stake of has maintained a library department. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 383 Each year seven or eight new books were added and the total circulated about among the wards of the stake. Best sellers in biography, fiction, and philosophy, constituted the library. Much good has been derived by the women of our stake from this source of reading material. A year ago we decided to expand our library and made arrangements with the bishop of Mt. Pleasant South Ward for use of a little-used room in the chapel. My husband built us several sections of open bookshelves, all movable, allowing for easy cleaning and rearrangement. Several members of the stake board cleaned the room and stained and varnished the shelves. We procured a used desk and got permission from the ward Relief Society to use a few extra chairs they had. Then we made a call for suitable books and combined those received with those we already had accumulated. We added some new ones, mostly of a theological nature, and some of the finer books of fiction, and biography. Through the years some books were lost, but at the present time we have around 150 volumes on our shelves. Included is a set of the Documentary History 01 the Church? by the Prophet Joseph Smith. There are also eight bound volumes of TheOne of our sisters contributed Magazines her mother had saved through the years, dating back to 1915, and we will have these bound. \"We have found that there is a strong preference among the women of the stake for the books of a spiritual nature. Each ward has a librarian who handles the exchange of books for her ward each month when she attends stake leadership meeting, taking back to her ward those books for which the sisters have expressed preference. Last year we adopted a slogan, 'Reading as a Morale Builder.' It has been a joy to see the high type of reading ?a very great percentage the works of our Church writers?toward which our women incline. \"Our library has great possibilities as a study room and source of information in our educational departments. It will take time to build it carefully toward our goal, but we are convinced it can and will be done.\" Maricopa Stake (Arizona) IRENE A. DUKE, stake Relief Society secretary, reports: ?The Maricopa Stake Relief Society sponsored a special testimony meeting for all women of the stake on Sunday, December 31, 1944, from 2 to 3:30 p. M. In the Mesa Second Ward chapel. \"Sister Ella Bentley played soft organ music as over two hundred women assembled to worship. A poem 'Home' was read by First Counselor Vida D. Brinton. President Irene L. Brown gave a brief address of welcome and bore her testimony. Seventeen women related inspirational testimonies of faith and courage, healings and answers to prayers, expressing hope and faith in the future despite the present war-torn world. \"At intervals, choice musical selections were rendered, including organ solos by Ella Bentley, ladies' trio from Tempe Ward, a Singing Mothers? chorus from Gilbert Ward, and a ladies' chorus from Mesa Fourth Ward. \"This inspirational meeting brought solace and renewed courage to the women of this stake.\" Members of the Downey Ward Relief Society, Portneuf Stake, with the 52 Christmas boxes they packed early last October for overseas shipment to servicemen from Downey Ward. They observed a minute of silent prayer before packing the boxes. On November 21, they packed boxes for the boys stationed in the United States. Helen Hyde is president of this ward Relief Society.

Soliloquy Celia A. Van Cott Arid desert, land of the unconsolable Where the wailing wild winds moan Through the purple sage, where segos bloom In the land where the red men roam. Here in this disconsolate wasteland We've conquered, we've known no defeat; We've garnered the stars for our lamplight, In the bowels of the earth we found heat. Silver streams flash down the canyons, Brought from the high mountain's crest To the land of the blossoming valleys In Utah, sovereign State of the West. This Night to Remember Christie Lund Coles HE didn't say anything . . . he didn't need to. At the touch of his hand, she stood up and fitted into the curve of his arm while her hand slipped slowly up the shoulder of his dark coat. Their bodies moved together with the effortless grace of water.\nThe sky, through the high gymnasium window, was lighted by a full moon over which clouds moved like wind-blown thistle. A trumpet trio had stepped to the front of the stage and was harmonizing an old waltz. The lights were dim and these young people who had never learned to waltz, moved slowly, shuffling their feet, stardust in their eyes.\nBoys in uniforms with girls clinging to their arms stepped through the side doors into the night. But Felice and Chad continued dancing silently, easily, as if there were no time, no future, only the rhythmic moments.\nBut when the tune was ended they moved to join several other boys and girls. One of the boys said, \"Say, maybe we're lucky to be in engineering. For the time, at least, tonight is just another night to us. But to these other kids it's the last for a long time. They're trying to cram a lifetime into a few hours.\"\n\"How right,\" Chad agreed, easily, gaily, though Felice thought she saw the flesh darken above his white collar. He turned to her rather quickly and his arm tensed. \"Are we five?\"\nShe nodded, smiling into his brown eyes, and they moved toward the open door.\nONCE outside, their feet seemed automatically to go toward the south lawn of the campus where the maples in their riotous colors formed a parasol of lace over their heads, where the oaks and the silver birch stood quivering against the sky. They walked slowly, unhurried ly as they had done on many nights before, their hands clasped lightly together, a silence?deep and understanding?between them.\nFinally, she said, \"The boys look cute in their uniforms, don't they Chad?\"\n\"Fine,\" he agreed, then clearing his throat, \"It will seem strange around here with so many of them gone.\"\nAs they walked they saw couples in various places, a boy and a girl sitting close, talking in fast, incoherent sentences, trying to say things that would bridge the time until they met again.\nFelice repeated, \"Trying to cram a lifetime into a few hours. How can they know which are the important things to say? How could one choose?\"\n\"Yes, how?\" he repeated, steering her to the left until he brought her to a birch tree where they paused. \"Remember?\" he asked quietly, running his hand over the bark that had been cut with a sharp knife to form their initials. \"Weren't we silly? Page  Each trying to out-talk the other, both afraid we would never have another chance to say the things we felt.\" \"I suppose that's how it is with them tonight. They are afraid... And well they might be.\" \"Would you be afraid?\" he asked, leaning his tall length against the tree, looking down at her, a quizzical smile upon his lean features. \"Perhaps. I don't really know.\" \"What was it you said that first night, \"Love isn't a part of time.' \" \"Oh, that. I said, 'Love has nothing to do with time or space or age.' I must have read it someplace. And sophomores are so wise.\" He laughed shortly, \"And not wise at all when we are seniors. Who was it said that when he graduated from high school he knew it all but when he finished college he realized how much there was that he didn't know.\" \"I wonder if anyone ever feels that he knows a whole lot?\" she asked, her narrow forehead wrinkled becomingly. \"I'm sure I don't. And I doubt if anyone does in these times. But let's talk about us.\" \"There'll be plenty of time for that. In fact, there has been some little time spent on the subject... Or don't you remember?\" \"Sure do, lady,\" he assured her. \"But I'm just checking to be sure I remember rightly. Are you still taking good care of that frat pin I gave you? Does it mean as much as it did before?\" She looked surprised, \"Why, of course, Chad.\" He took her hands in his, \"Does it still make you dizzy when you think about me?\" \"But, sir, spare my blushes. Don't hold everything I say against me.\" There was laughter in the brown eyes she lifted to his and her wide, young mouth was parted softly. Suddenly, he pulled her to him and kissed her slowly, gently, then harder, hungrily, as though to solace a deep hurt or a dark fear. She drew back, \"Now, what good would thinking about you do, after that.\" He tweaked her ear, laughing gently, \"Come on, Twerp, if we hurry we can see Orion.\" \"Really. Isn't it funny you've been saying that every week for over two years and it still gives me the same thrill. Seeing those stars sort of puts us in our place.\" LATER, when they came out of the observatory building, they paused to let the wind brush cooling fingers through their hair. They looked down over the sleeping college town, the beloved campus, the blue hills to the west. She sighed, \"Another Friday night... Just like the others, yet somehow different. And now home.\" \"Just one more thing,\" he whispered, huskily, laying his hand on her silken hair, \"I love you.\" \"And I love you, Chad. Lots.\" \"I've got to tell you,\" he began swiftly, \"I'm going, too. I'm going with the others tomorrow. I enlisted. I should have told you but I wanted tonight to be just as the other nights had been. As long as you didn't know, it was okay. But... But, if you had known I would have been tempted to ask you to run away from the crowd tonight, to ask you to marry me . . . or something.\"\nHis words had followed on one another so quickly that her choked, \"Oh, Chad,\" had been lost in the web of them. Now, he stopped, holding her by the shoulders with his hands, looking intently into her eyes.\nHer voice caught in her throat as she asked, \"Could you have treasured anything more . . . than . . . tonight?\"\nHe lifted her chin in his hand, shook his head. \"No, Twerp. I'm sure of one thing, lifetimes can't be lived in that. It's like running backwards . . . you never quite catch\nup with yourself. I'll know you are here, waiting. That's enough.\"\n\"And I'll know, I'll know every minute, Chad, that you'll be coming back. Tonight will be doubly precious because it was just like other nights.\"\nThey looked long at one another, kissed. When he let her go, she said, \"There's just one more thing, Chad, . . . Your sister told me this morning that you were leaving.\"\nHe gave a short laugh before he whispered, \"You did joke!\"\nThen his fingers curled hard about hers, they started down the hill, a silence?deep and understanding?between them."

As faith and labor walk beside the plow Nobility and Peace shall find their berth. Such furrows bear the roots of all that live, The hand of him I love has turned this sod Here shall we find a fruitful destiny To work in faithful fellowship with God. And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER II Synopsis Delsa Marriott receives a letter from her fiance, Hugh Temple, with the army in Australia, asking her to release him from their engagement so that he can marry an Australian girl. Delsa is broken-hearted, and because her family and friends have long looked forward to this marriage, she hesitates to tell them that she has been jilted, and decides to keep this a secret until she can make up her mind whether or not to release Hugh. DELSA took especial pains with her looks the next morning. The little children had such sharp eyes, such inquisitive minds, such uninhibited interest in their teacher. Likely as not Rickey Graham would look at her sharply and say, \"You been cryin', teacher? You tell me what's wrong and I'll fix it!\" Ricky was genuinely fond of her. And there was Jeff Holden, his gray eyes kindly penetrating. She didn't want any questions, even unasked ones. During the night Delsa had made up her mind to one thing: she would not write to Hugh immediately. She would wait a little, think the matter over before she told him he was free. For she had thought of their engagement as he had done?as something as binding as a marriage vow. She had not gone out once, not even to a town dance, with anyone since Hugh left. She hadn't even thought of any other boy. Page 420 Now, by Hugh's own word, she was free to think, to look at others. Maybe she would find that she, too, had been blinded by their childhood friendship; maybe she would find that other men existed in this world. But whether she did or not, she would at least give herself time to think of a way to break the news to her family and friends; and she would give Hugh time to realize what he was doing?to realize that his letter had been a devastating thing to her?not a question to be decided lightly. \"But of course,\" Delsa whispered into her mirror, \"of course, Delsa, you can't keep him if he wants to be free. But maybe he doesn't. Maybe, if I play for time, he'll come back to his senses, his honest, smalltown senses, and to me!\" Careful as she had tried to be, Delsa had evidently not succeeded in making herself look gay and carefree. She knew this by the anxious look her mother gave her when she came into the big kitchen for breakfast?a searching look, followed by bright, casual remarks, with no reference to last night. The oatmeal was bubbling in its kettle on the stove, and her mother served her a bowl full of the steaming goodness. She poured over it the thick, yellow pan cream, saying, \"You're lucky, Delsa. You can eat all the cream and mush you want and not put on an ounce. It's using your brain does it, I always say. If we older women would just use our minds the way we did when we were young?\"\n\"Now, Mom!\" Delsa smiled, \"maybe it isn't that. Maybe it just takes oatmeal and cream a long time to work. These breakfasts will be showing on my hips some day?\"Don't you get to thinking that, Delsa. You need good food, the way you work and struggle with those kids. You eat that mush now.\"\nBut the mush didn't look good any longer. Not that she was worried about getting fat?not any more. What difference would it make? She would still be Miss Delsa, the school teacher, and her pupils wouldn't notice the gradually accumulating heaviness and slowness and dullness.\nShe threw a soft knit scarf over her light curls and went out into the March morning. She didn't look again into the mirror or she would have seen that the robin's egg blue of the scarf had deepened the blue of her eyes?and had deepened, also, the shadows that lay like pale wings below them.\nThe children ran to meet her, shrieking with joy, holding before them the bright paper pinwheels she had let them make yesterday. She laughed back at them, thinking what a pretty picture they made, running along the country road in the March wind with the red and yellow and green bits of paper whirling in front of them. Maybe, if she were an artist or a poet, she could catch this innocent gaiety and keep it, to remember that she, too, had once run free and gay with the wind and yellow pinwheels.\nJEFF HOLDEN was on the hill back of the school building with the eighth grade boys, flying kites. Jeff was principal of the two-roomed school, and teacher of the upper four grades. He was also scoutmaster, crafts instructor and friend of the adolescent boys, who were feeling the hardness of the war, too, since their older brothers and neighbors?their heroes and companions and instructors in normal times?had been called away.\nJeff saw Delsa and, waving at her, shouted, \"Not nine yet!\"\nShe nodded and cried against the wind, \"Nearly!\"\nJeff came running down the hill, lightly and easily in spite of his twenty-six years. His dark hair was rumpled by the wind and he was laughing, but his eyes, amazingly gray in his tanned face, were tired and serious. He looked at Delsa and said, lightly, \"That letter from Hugh?he's all right, I take it?\"\nDelsa smiled, \"Hugh's letters should be posted in the post office for all to read,\" she began, and then caught her words back, remembering what Hugh had written.\n\"All the boys' letters should, I maintain!\" Jeff agreed gaily, apparently not noticing the break in Delsa's sentence. \"In a town this size, where every boy is sort of neighbor-hood property, the letters from all parts of the world sort of belong to us all, don't you think?\"\n\"Well, the town does hear most of them,\" Delsa defended, \"They're read in Church?all that are proper to be read. Even in a town like this, the boys ought to be allowed to write some private news?\"\n\"Jeff laughed. \"Grand!\" He looked at his watch, whistled sharply. Henry Lake ran into the school building and brought out the big, old-fashioned bell and began to ring it with all his might. The children trooped down from the hillside, in from the road. Delsa went inside, sat down at the piano in the \"big room,\" and began to play a march. The pupils filed in, sedate and orderly in contrast to their actions outdoors. Going to her own room, she passed Jeff in the tiny hall that ran between the two classrooms. She paused a moment. ?You look tired, Jeff,\" she said, \"Anything wrong at home?\" He smiled at her. \"Trudy was sick last night,\" he explained. \"I don't know what is wrong with her all the time. Mrs. Reeder seems to know about babies and Davy's okay. But Trudy gets thinner and thinner.\" ?I?ll run over after school,\" Delsa promised. \"I'm no child expert, but maybe I can discover what's wrong. I don't think Mrs. Reeder's too bright, anyway, with babies.\" \"Now I have something else to think of,\" Delsa thought with relief. \"Poor little Trudy!\" And poor Jeff! Struggling as he was with two children and a housekeeper who was neither smart nor very conscientious. It wouldn't have been so bad before the war. If Jeff's wife, Lucy, had died in normal times, there would have been a dozen capable women in the town ready to help him out with his babies and his house. But now they had all gone to work at the phosphate plant in the next valley. A big bus picked them up every morning and brought them home every night ?good wages and clean work, different from the familiar drudgery of housekeeping. You couldn't blame them for taking the jobs, drawing the good pay, especially when they felt that they were helping win the war, too. Jeff's problem was a minor one in their opinion. Only Mrs. Reeder was left to help him, Mrs. Reeder, who had proved too inept for a job at the plant. But Jeff made the best of it, running his household with one hand while he managed the school with the other. Delsa knew that Jeff had been deferred officially on account of his farm, which was large enough and important enough to win him exemption. But he was doing an even more essential work in the school, and for less pay. The woman who had been principal had left to take a job in a war plant at more than twice her teacher's salary. The big boys had been getting obstreperous; the larger girls becoming a problem ?adolescents with the maturity of country children and the freedom and intimacy of a small town and a lack of supervision due to their disrupted home lives. So Jeff had stepped in and taken over the school and the whole town had felt the benefit?and would feel it for a generation or more, Delsa admitted to herself. But few of the townspeople seemed to realize what Jeff was doing. Oh, some of them reached out a friendly hand when they had time, but for the most part he was limping along practically unaided. Delsa decided to take more time from her own problems and her own activities to take a look at Trudy now and then. SHE was shocked when she entered Jeff's little house. Lucy had always kept it so sparkling and bright that Delsa had thought of it as a doll's house. Now the doll's house was in disorder?and dirty. Windows were unwashed, curtains hung limp. In a soiled bed Trudy lay whimpering. Mrs. Reeder was rocking and reading.\n\"Don't do no good to pick her up, Delsa,\" Mrs. Reeder complained. \"She just likes to bawl, seems like.\"\n\"She's wet and cold,\" Delsa said sharply. \"Where's Davy?\"\n\"Outside.\" Mrs. Reeder wasn't bothered by Delsa's implied criticism. \"He won't stay indoors, even if he has a cold.\"\n\"Call him in,\" Delsa ordered. She put a kettle of water on the stove, where the fire was burning brightly enough to keep Mrs. Reeder comfortable, and picked up Trudy. Anger surged through her at sight of the little girl. She was almost a year old?should have been rosy-poly and smiling and rosy, but she was thin and whining. What was the town thinking of to let a lovely baby like this?Jeff's and Lucy's baby?get into this shape? What ails, when Jeff stepped into the had she herself been thinking?\nDelsa shrugged. She had been working on her trousseau. Every afternoon and evening, sewing, crocheting, making things for her's and Hugh's comfort and pleasure. The other women had been at their own personal activities, too. They were all to blame, she, perhaps, more than the rest. Why hadn't Jeff complained? Why hadn't he shaken some sense into her?\nDavy came in, his muddy shoes making tracks across the dirty floor.\nDelsa put Trudy in the big kitchen rocking chair, so that Mrs. Reeder would not have a place to sit, and said, \"You watch her, Davy.\"\nShe set Mrs. Reeder to scrubbing the kitchen floor while she unmade Trudy's bed, hung the blankets and mattress on the line in the clean March wind, and hunted about for clean sheets and pillow case and clothing for the baby.\nWhen Trudy was bathed and warm and cooing with satisfaction, Delsa set her in her crib and started on Davy. He was a sturdy little fellow, evidently able to get the things he needed in spite of Mrs. Reeder's indolence. But he reveled in the attention, so the soapy bath, Delsa had then to curl under her brisk toweling, felt it looked exactly like his father's.\nJeff came in and whistled when he saw the activity. As teacher of the \"big room\" and principal, he hadn't been able to leave as early as Delsa had?he generally was at the building till nearly five?so the floor was scrubbed, Trudy was gurgling and Davey was laughing, rosy and clean in his faded blue coveralls, when Jeff stepped into the room.\nHe smiled at Delsa, and there was more than appreciation in that smile.\n\"Wonder woman!\" he grinned, and went on gaily, \"'And the touch of her deft fingers turned a shack into a home,' unquote.\"\nDelsa smiled back, but a little grimly.\n\"You've got to put your foot down with Mrs. Reeder,\" she said firmly. \"She must just sit here all day long and let these babies take care of themselves. Davy, bless his heart, is a capable little fellow, and hasn't suffered too much. But Trudy is going to be ill, Jeff, really ill, unless she gets proper care.\" \"I've been afraid of it,\" he said wearily, \"but what can I do? I do bathe them and feed them at night, but I just don't have time in the mornings. There are the chores to do-\" \"Aren't there any of the older boys that could help with those?\" Delsa asked. Jeff shook his head. \"They've all got more to do than they can manage. Why, that little romp on the hill this morning?fifteen minutes, all told, will have to be paid for by everyone of us with extra work tonight.\" He walked into the bedroom and picked up Trudy and held her close, rubbing his cheek against the soft down of her hair. \"Daddy's girl!\" he whispered. \"Daddy's girl can take it, even if she shouldn't be asked to. And he'll make it up to her some day, Trudy. That's a promise.\" Delsa felt the tears, sudden and sharp, behind her lashes. \"Jeff,? she said seriously, \"it's all right to promise, but you can't keep that promise, you know. You can't ever make up to a baby for lack of care in its first few years. It's now or never,\" He sighed, \"Then it'll have to be never, Trudy baby, because it simply can't be now. I can't do any more.\" Delsa replied, \"Look, Jeff. If you won't think I'm butting in where I have no right to be, I'll run over here for a half hour before school every morning and drop in again at night. I can tell Mrs. Reeder exactly what to do and see that she does it. If she thinks any one is checking on her, she'll probably work all right. Would you mind?\" \"Would I mind? She asks,\" Jeff said with wonder in his voice. \"It's a deal, then,\" Delsa said briskly. \"Now get your clothes changed and get those chores done. Mrs. Reeder will have your supper ready soon. I'll feed Trudy and then you'll be all right for tonight.\" Jeff handed her the baby and Delsa began to feed her hot oatmeal with whole milk and sugar. Trudy ate it greedily, making little hungry sounds as she mouthed the rich, warm food. Jeff, in his overalls now, came and stood in the doorway, watching them. \"I've never seen her eat like that,\" he said. \"She's a funny little chick,\" Delsa said, holding the warm body closer to her, \"She wants love and cuddling, Jeff, more than most babies do. She just has to have it?\" Delsa stopped, suddenly remembering that Trudy had been robbed of her natural source of comfort and love. And not only Trudy, but Davy and Jeff, too. Delsa glanced up at Jeff, and her heart constricted. Hugh! Hugh! She thought, why can't it be you leaning there in the doorway, watching? Why must I, too, be robbed of my love? She bent her head low over Trudy to hide her tears from Jeff. He turned slowly and went outside, and Delsa held the baby close, close for a moment. \"That is what I've wanted all the {Continued on page 447) LESSON DEPARTMENT Suggestions and Instructions on the Educational program COURSES for the coming educational year 1945-46, October through May, are as follows: Theology ? Church History (Continued). Visiting Teachers' Messages ? Sources of Strength: Charity. Literature ? The Bible in Our Literature. Social Science ? Modern Applications of Moral Principles (Continued). Again, as was the case for the educational year 1944-45, there are no special lessons outlined for use by the missions, since it is felt that all the lessons are suitable for use in the missions either as they are written or with slight adaptations. Moreover, according to present Church procedure in regard to lesson material taught by any auxiliary, all lessons to be taught must be approved by the Church Publications Committee through the General Board. This, therefore, renders it improper for missions or stakes to substitute lessons of their own choosing in place of the theology, visiting teachers' messages, literature or social science lessons which appear in Theand have been approved. The Goal of Relief Society Teaching Depending upon the skill of the teacher, many and varied methods of conducting a class period may be followed. All Relief Society teachers are not equally trained in teaching and many fine teachers have not had professional training. The best teachers, however, are always eager to improve their methods and make more effective their teaching. It is of paramount importance, however highly skilled a teacher may be, that she teach in the spirit of the gospel and give prayerful and conscientious study to her lessons. In addition, however, to the preparation of the lesson by a teacher, she should present it in such a way as to awaken in the members of her class a wish to study and gain knowledge for themselves. This desired end may be obtained by a variety of methods?by class participation either by an informal discussion, questions and answers, or by a more formal presentation such as a round table, panel discussion, etc., or by home study on the part of individual members. Whatever the means employed by the class leader, the result will be good teaching if both she and the Relief Society class members add to and increase their knowledge and strengthen their testimonies. Page  The lessons in the Social Science course for 1945-1946 \"Modern Applications of Moral Principles\" are to be taught in the light of revealed truth, as these principles have been set forth in gospel teachings. Special attention should therefore be given to the use of the references to Church literature found at the end of each lesson. In all Relief Society lessons the material taught must conform strictly to Church doctrine and belief. It is a great responsibility to undertake to teach a group of fellow Relief Society women. It is also a great privilege. From the hours of intensive study spent in preparation for each Relief Society lesson by a class leader come intellectual growth and a greater understanding of the gospel. May each class leader in the coming season do her utmost to impart knowledge to her class members and also awaken in them a desire to study and learn for themselves so that the testimonies of all Relief Society members may be strengthened. While lesson titles and lesson anus for each of the courses of study for the ensuing year are given in the previews, these are subject to change. Correspondence on Lessons Ward class leaders who desire help on any matter pertaining to a lesson should consult their stake leaders. Stake leaders desiring information may address such correspondence to General Board of Relief Society, Salt Lake City 1, Utah. It is not desirable to address communications either to the authors of the lessons or to any other Church office. Textbooks and Special References Textbooks should be supplied for the use of the respective class leaders from the funds of the Society. On the completion of the course the books should be returned to the Society for inclusion in the Relief Society library. If the special references are Church books, it may be desirable to purchase one or two for present and future availability. However, if the books do not hold lasting interest, it will be better to use library copies rather than to purchase books which will have only slight use. Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden (II Nephi 26:28). LESSON DEPARTMENT 427 Theology Church History Dr. H. Wayne Diiggs Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 A preview of the second year's course of study entitled \"Church History\" introduces the lessons for 1945-46. Titles for the next eight lessons and their objectives follow below. It will be remembered that the central theme for the course is to be found in the Savior's words \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" Again we shall look at the fruits of Mormonism and find them good. By way of review we may summarize the three parts of the course once more. Part I for 1944-45 was devoted to the opening dispensation of the fullness of times and had as its objective the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the coming of the \"church out of the wilderness\"; Part I for 1945-46 outlines the story of the saints in their movement to \"the place which God prepared\" in the tops of the everlasting mountains; Part III for 1946-47 pertains to the coming-of-age period of the Church with its broadened activities meeting the swift sweep of our modern times. The main objective of the course is to narrate the more important events of Church history and to consider the revelations in their relation to the historical episodes. We revere the revelations contained in the book of the Doctrine and Covenants as the revealed word of God for our day. The titles of the eight lessons for this year's course follow: 9. The Martyrdom oi Joseph Smith Objective: To indicate the worth of a great testimony and its supreme value to the onward development of the Church. 10. Brigham Young's CaJ] to Leadership Objective: To show the power of leadership under God. 11. The Journey Westward Objective: To trace the march of the saints westward and to show that physical hardships can more easily be endured by those who are supported by the spirit of the Lord than by those who are without his spirit. 12. Building an Empire in the West Objective: To indicate the beginning fulfillment of prophecy concerning the gathering of Israel. 13. Stakes oi Zion Increased Objective: To suggest the firm and sure way the Lord has of extending his purposes in the earth. 14. The Missionary System Broadened Objective: To develop the truth that the gospel is ours, but we must strive to share it with others. 15. The United Order Begun Objective: To show how the Lord strives always to have his children seek the more perfect social order of living. 16. The Building oi Temples Continues Objective: To show that God provides for the fulfillment of all his promises. In this second series of Church history lessons there will be need for the use of a book on Church history in addition to the Doctrine and Covenants which again is to be the text for the year. The book Essentials in Church History by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, published in 1942 by the Deseret News Press, Salt Lake City, Utah, is recommended. While the lessons, it is hoped, will set the central objective for each month for the reading and discussion period, yet these necessarily short bits of writing covering but briefly the far-reaching episodes of our history, will need additional source material to enrich the story of our Church and its revealed doctrine. Essentials in Church History can provide such an enlargement of the theme. Do not lose track of the place of the Doctrine and Covenants in this study. Here, the words you will read are the words of the Lord which ever illuminate the enduring principles of life. Through all the study let us not forget our repeating phrase from lesson to lesson?we must \"give heed unto his word\" which has been written especially for us in this day. As to the method of class discussion, bear the following in mind: Somehow in too many lessons practically all of the material is given in the written lesson itself. The teacher covers this part fairly well. When, however, she reaches the discussion period, she poses questions that draw a weak response. To this she must then supplement her own contribution. In overcoming such difficulty there is the necessity of putting real content into the discussion period. In the case of the present series, this is done by directing class members to the words of the Lord as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. Once a class, after attempting to answer a simple but searching question, is turned to the clear and convincing facts as phrased by the Master, hearts are warmed; and minds, seeking ready confirmation of truth, recall personal illustrations which press for expression. Testimonies result, and the teacher assumes her rightful role as director, rather than taskmaster of the hour. Text and References Doctrine and Covenants. Price $1.00.

Lesson 9-The Martyrdom of Joseph Smith For Tuesday, October 2, 1945 Objective: To indicate the worth of a great testimony and its supreme value to the onward development of the Church. JOSEPH SMITH, prophet of the * nineteenth century, stood one January day in the year 1844 to address the newly appointed officers of peace for the city of Nauvoo. As mayor of the city he spoke, and within his voice was heard the prophetic tone of impending danger for himself and people. Some thirteen years had passed since the ?little flock\" who first believed this modern seer had gathered at the home of Peter Whitmer that April day in 1830 to organize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And what bright yet bitter years these had been! Half a continent had been spanned in the march of missionary endeavor. Yes, even the Old World, too, had heard the elders sent by express command of a latter-day prophet. Now around him thousands of saints had gathered, and had builded Nauvoo, the most beautiful of cities then to be found on the rich and fertile soil of Illinois. Could it be that the time had truly come when Zion was to rejoice and but hold in memory those trying days of Kirtland and Independence? His words on this January day seemed not to indicate this for he said:... I am exposed to far greater danger from traitors among ourselves than from enemies without, although my life has been sought for many years by the civil and military authorities, priests, and people of Missouri; and if I can escape from the ungrateful treachery of assassins, I can live as Caesar might have lived, were it not for a right-hand Brutus. I have had pretended friends betray me. All the enemies upon the face of the earth may roar and exert all their power to bring about my death, but they can accomplish nothing, unless some who are among us and enjoy our society, have been with us in our councils, participated in our confidence, taken us by the hand, called us brother, saluted us with a kiss, join with our enemies, turn our virtues into faults, and, by falsehood and deceit, stir up their wrath and indignation against us, and. Bring their united vengeance upon our heads. All the hue-and-cry of the chief priests and elders against the Savior, could not bring down the wrath of the Jewish nation upon His head, and thereby cause the crucifixion of the Son of God, until Judas said unto them, \"Whomsoever I shall kiss, he is the man; hold him fast.? Judas was one of the Twelve Apostles, even their treasurer, and dipt with their Master in the dish, and through his treachery, the crucifixion was brought about; and we have a Judas in our midst. (Essentials in Church History, pp. 360-361; D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 152) What group of traitors from within would now essay the role of Judas and, pincer-like, provide the other prong of opposition to join with those mobocrats, from without to encircle and destroy the Prophet and his work? Somehow the storm of hate which ten years before had set the cry in Missouri, \"the Mormons must go,\" now insidiously smoldered within the very councils of the Church. William Law, the Prophet's second counselor, together with his brother Wilson, William Marks, Leonard Soby, Robert Foster and others took offense at their leader's words and pulled away into a council of apostates who were secretly to pledge themselves to destroy Joseph Smith and his party; in fact, it was later discovered that William Law was in league with the Missourians who ever since the escape of the Prophet from their State had vowed to reach across the border line of Illinois and claim their man.\nRealizing the price God had set upon the strength of a testament, (Hebrews 9:16-17), Joseph Smith repeatedly forewarned his followers of his coming death, first by visioning the ultimate need of a land beyond the rim of the great western mountains to which the saints might press for safety; and second, through his frequent words concerning the threats upon his own life. At a conference in October of 1843 he said, \"This generation is as corrupt as the generation of Jews that crucified Christ; and if he were here today, and should preach the same doctrine he did then they would put him to death. I defy all the world to destroy the work of God; and I prophecy they shall never have power to kill me till my work is accomplished, and I am ready to die.\" (Essentials in Church History, p. 365; D.H.C. Vol. VI, page 58.)\nSome eight months following this meeting with the saints, Joseph Smith with his brother Hyrum was martyred in Carthage Jail, having calmly willed to surrender to the Prophet's enemies in the assurance that the true priesthood and spirit of the Lord necessary to establish the Church of Jesus Christ were again on earth. His courageous mission had made this so. Now the work of God was a living reality as evidenced by testimonies of hundreds of faithful and devoted saints. The story of the swift and final days ending with the death of the Prophet will ever live in the hearts of those who love him, for with the unselfish gift of his own life, they may now lay claim upon the force of his testimony.\nLet us briefly follow the steps of the story to see how boldly this modern seer of his own free will made the supreme gift for the Church of Christ he again established. It should be remembered that ever through the struggle to bring again the work of God in the latter days, the powers of evil bored from within as well as without. Men who at first were true, turned false, to join with those who ever hated the truth. With the increase of Church membership and the promise of peace and plenty for the saints mounting, fear and jealousy stole into the hearts of Joseph Smith's enemies. He had now become a figure of national interest. As lieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion, as mayor of Nauvoo, and as candidate for the office of President of the United States, prominent citizens sought him, wondered at his wisdom, and often inwardly feared the divine power of his office as prophet of God. Those who could curry favor of him for their own advantage did so, and those who feared, sought secretly either to work upon the ignorance and hatred of fanatical mobocrats to bring about his overthrow, or, by failure to act in the cause of justice, used their office to wink at infractions of the law. Thus because of the words of weak-willed officers, the saints suffered; their Prophet time and again was arrested, then arraigned before a court of justice to stand trial, only to be set free.\nSo between the cross fire of writs which shuttled back and forth between the Governors of Missouri and Illinois, he threaded his way in and out of the trials where enraged deputies lay in wait to ambush him. Such had been his lot up to that January in the year of 1844.\nDuring the months of February and March which followed, often his thoughts and acts were turned to constructive plans toward the fulfillment of the Rocky Mountain prophecy of August 6, 1842. It was decided to send some twenty-five men to explore all the mountain country, carrying the gospel message wherever they went. Any man who could \"raise $500, a good horse and a mule, a double-barrel gun, one barrel rifle and the other smooth bore, a saddle, and bridle, a pair of revolving pistols, bowie-knife, and a good saber\" might volunteer. Visioning the future of his people, the Prophet predicted that within five years the saints would be out of the power of their enemies, and asked that his\nwords might be written down that none \"need not say they had forgotten the saying.\"\nSpring of the year 1844 was to see events that led up to the fulfillment of Joseph Smith's predictions concerning his own death. Within this season came the dark combinations of apostates. Men who before had been high in the councils of the Church met at the fifth. Chauncey L. Higbee, Robert D. Foster, Joseph H. Jackson and Wilson and William Law together with Austin Cowles, Francis M. Higbee, Charles Ivins and Charles A. Foster were implicated in a conspiracy to kill the Prophet. When exposed, the first five named were excommunicated. Imbithered, they, with others, attempted to organize a church of their own with William Law at its head. Their efforts were doomed to failure. Frustrated, they then sought other means to satisfy their alleged plans, and they hit upon a malicious course of airing their hatred of the Prophet and his cause by means of the press. Their organ, the Nauvoo Expositor, appeared June 7, 1844. It was filled with vile slander aimed at Joseph Smith and many of Nauvoo's leading citizens. Striking at the most vulnerable spot in the body armor of saints, they attacked the Nauvoo Charter, a document of most liberal and far-reaching grants, under which the then thriving commonwealth on the bend of the Mississippi had come into being. The citizens of Nauvoo could not and would not accept this underhand thrust at their very existence. Within three days the city council met and declared the Expositor a public nuisance. The city marshal, John P. Greene, with a few men then proceeded to the printing office where they pied the type and burned the printed papers. The day following, Francis M. Higbee made complaint before Thomas Morrison, a justice at Carthage, for riot and destruction of the press. The warrant required the Prophet to go before Morrison or some other justice of the peace for trial. Here was the explosion the mobs were waiting for. Assemblies of mobocrats, speeches, resolutions, extermination orders for the \"wicked Mormons\" threatened the saints on every hand. Nauvoo was placed under martial law with its Legion mustered for protection.\nIn his effort to comply with the law, Joseph Smith appeared before Daniel H. Wells?a non-Mormon justice, but after hearing the case discharged the matter. Enemies of the Prophet claimed the trial was unlawful. It became necessary for Joseph to appeal to Governor Ford of Illinois for protection. In a letter dated June 16, the Prophet requested the Governor to make a trip to Nauvoo in order to halt the threatening danger of the saints. Ford came, but stopped at Carthage, where he surrounded himself with the worst apostates who, in league with the mobs, drowned any cry for justice. President Smith and all those accused were commanded to come and appear before Thomas Morrison of Carthage for trial, if not peaceably, then to the clank of muskets and force.\nJune 22nd found the Prophet with his brother Hyrum and eight of his close associates at a meeting in an upper room of his office. Shortly after the curfew hour, Hyrum came down from his room to the\nHouse to greet Reynolds Cahoon with these words, \"A company of men are seeking to kill my brother Joseph, and the Lord has warned him to flee to the Rocky Mountains to save his life. Good-bye Brother Cahoon, we shall see you again.\" (D.H.C. Vol. VI, page 547). It had been the decision of that evening to have the Prophet flee.\nThe next morning, the Governor's posse arrived in Nauvoo to find no Prophet. Shortly after noon that day, Emma Smith sent word by Orrin P. Rockwell to have her husband return; he having the night before just crossed the river. The most cutting part of the message bore the news that some of the leading brethren had accused the Prophet of cowardice. Realizing, then, that there would be those who would mistake the true reason for his departure, which was for the safety of his people, Joseph determined to return \"and see the thing out.\" Hyrum stood one with him.\nThe next day found these two brothers with the accused members of the city council and a few friends riding to the town of Carthage. Behind them the green and pleasant city of Nauvoo lay under the warmth of an early morning sun in June. The rattle of hoofs and the stretch of saddle leather talked their recedies. It was a company of about sixty mounted militia, under the command of Captain Dunn, who reined to a stop the little party. Orders were to have the Nauvoo Legion surrender all state arms. Meekness and might again had met. The Prophet spoke:\nI am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's morning. I have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward all men. LESSON DEPARTMENT 433 If they take my life I shall die an innocent man, and my blood shall cry from the ground for vengeance, and it shall be said of me \"He was murdered in cold blood!\" Essentials in Church History, p. 376; D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 555) Defenseless and at the mercy of their enemies, once more the saints found themselves as the hour of midnight saw their Prophet in Carthage ready to stand trial on the false charge of treason against the State of Illinois. The two days that followed are black upon the calendar of eternal justice. A Governor's broken pledge, an illegal summons, the impatient cruelty of a mob that would not wait for the law, all crowded the remaining earthly hours for the Prophet and Hyrum Smith as they sat in the Carthage Jail. It was after five on the afternoon of June 27. Elder John Taylor had just finished singing for the second time, at the Prophet's request, \"A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.\" There was a discharge of arms at the outer door of the jail. Dr. Willard Richards hastened to the window to see about one hundred armed men at the door, many with blackened faces. The guard at the door fired into the air, as a flying wedge of men burst through the door and up a flight of stairs into the room that held the Prophet and his party. Shouts rang out as a shower of bullets poured into the room. Hyrum Smith fell crying, 'l am a dead man.\" Joseph, struck by two balls, lunged for a window?to fall into a circle of murderers, his parting words a testimony, \"O Lord, My God!\" It was done. The testator of the latter day work had sealed his life's mission with blood to give enduring strength to the cause he championed. What greater gift could any prophet bestow upon his friends? Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first answer the question; second read the assigned part in the text to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word.\" The class period for this opening les-soTT can be a very challenging one. There is within the story of the martyrdom much to be felt as well as discussed. The great shock of learning how innocent men were struck down by the very ones who ought to have loved them for the words of life they had taught can but leave the heart hurt and the mind forever wondering. There can be no real end to the brutal story of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Such a lesson as this will bear rereading many times just as the tragic news bore retelling many times during those last days of June in the year 1844. I. What are the personal blessings you now possess which will always put you in the debt of the Prophet Joseph Smith? One or two from each person will provide interesting facts to be discussed.

Read chapters 31 to 35 in Essentials in Church History by Joseph Fielding Smith. & Visiting Teachings? Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Dr. Lowell L. Bennion Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 MESSAGES for visiting teachers this year are based on Paul's masterful and inspiring discourse on charity found in I Corinthians, chapter 13. The subject is appropriate, for charity, as Paul defines it, lies at the heart of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Then, too, the Relief Society was organized, above all other reasons, to cultivate and express the spirit of charity. In this preview we shall consider the meaning of charity and give an overview of the messages which are to follow. What did Paul mean by the word \"charity\"? It is clear that its meaning was not restricted to almsgiving as it sometimes is today. This is evident from Paul's early statement: \"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\" To Paul charity also meant more than generosity and tolerance, attitudes which are implied in the expression?a charitable heart. Paul used charity as we use the word love. Such was the meaning of charity in 1611 when the King James translation of the Bible was made. More modern translations of the Bible use the word love because of the more restricted meaning which has come to be associated with the word charity. Thus \"love\" is a synonym for \"charity,\" although charity seems to have its own distinctive meaning as well (See Moroni 7:47). Love is the greatest principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. For this assertion we have the word of the Master himself. It is interesting to contemplate what a certain lawyer may have anticipated as an answer to the question he put to Jesus, \"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?\" Did he, perhaps, expect Jesus to quote one of the Ten Commandments? If so, he must have been surprised to hear the answer. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets\" (Matthew 22:35-40). The lawyer may well have been surprised, but not because these commandments were new, for they are included in the Mosaic law in Deuteronomy 6:5 and in Leviticus 19:18, respectively. The new thing in Jesus' restatement of these ancient laws was that he brought them together, made the second like unto the first, and made everything else in the Law of Moses and the Prophetic writings depend on these LESSON DEPARTMENT 435 two, on love. Love was to be the matrix, the warp and woof, and the heart and spirit of life. The apostle Paul, recognized for his faith in Christ, also knew that this faith must lead to love and must always be accompanied by love to be of worth, as he declared: \"... And though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.\" (I Cor. 13:2) \"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself (Galatians 5:14). A world ravaged by war and filled with hate is starving for love and charity. Children, parents, neighbors, fellow-Church members, the stranger within our gates, the widow, the orphan, the returning soldier, and our \"enemies\" all need the charity Paul describes. What do we mean by charity? How can we express our charity in daily life? These are questions to discuss through the year. The answers are suggested in this year's topics: 1. Christ's Example Objective: To show that Jesus in his own life exemplified true charity, demonstrating that a life of charity is filled with love and is free from self- pity, intolerance, envy, and hate. 2. \"Charity Suffereth Long and Is Kind\" Objective: To inspire patience and kindness in our human relations. 3. \"Charity Envieth Not\" Objective: To show that the cultivation of the spirit of charity will help rid our lives of envy. 4.\"Charity Vaunteth Not Itself, Is Not Pulled Up? Objective: To show that true charity is self-forgetting. 5. \"Charit}* Doth Not Behave It-self Unseemly\" Objective: To show that charity is tactful and courteous because it is inspired by a reverence for life. 6. \"Charity Rejoiceth In the Truth\" Objective: To show that one who is truly charitable rejoices in the truth. 7. \"Charity Hopeth All Things, Charity Endureth All Things\" Objective: To show that charity meets offense with patience, understanding, and hope. 8. \"Charity Never Faileth\" Objective: To encourage people to put their trust in charity as the unfailing means of improving themselves and influencing others for good. (For excellent suggestions on how these messages are to be taught, see The, pp- 403-404). Suggestion: Every visiting teacher would enjoy and profit by the frequent reading of I Corinthians, chapter 13. SALT FLAT DESERT Thelma Ireland In the valley stretch the salt flats Which the purple mountains hug. And the contrast makes the desert Look just like an ermine rug. Lesson I?Christ's Example For Tuesday, October 2, 1945 Objective: To show that Jesus in his own life exemplified true charity, demonstrating that a life of charity is filled with love and is free from self-pity, intolerance, envy, and hate. JESUS said, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30).\nJesus had seen the yoke upon the oxen, how it aided them in pulling the plow. Thus, he likened himself and his teachings to a yoke which, if taken upon ourselves, would make it easier for us to bear the burden of life. More than anything else this yoke was to be the principle of Christ-like love or charity.\nThe life of the Master was big with love \"as a tree with blossoms in the spring.\" His charity knew no limits, no bounds, neither height nor depth. It was everything which Paul said of charity?patient, kind, free of envy, unselfish, courteous, sincere, enduring, and unfailing.\nJesus did not discriminate in expressing his charity for men. Only the self-righteous hypocrites came under his condemnation (Matthew 23). To the rest of mankind he gave freely of himself. When his disciples rebuked parents for bothering Jesus with their young children, \"he was much displeased.\" Moreover, he used the occasion to teach a great truth (Mark 10:13-16). So aware was he of the needs of people,\nthat he was sensitive to the touch of faith by the woman who dared only to feel his garment (Mark 5:24-34). Here again we may contrast the attitude of his less sensitive disciples who wondered that Jesus should discern a single touch in the midst of a crowd. Pharisees and scribes marveled and murmured because there \"drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him\" (Luke 15:1-2). Out of compassion he fed the weary multitude. (Mark 6) His last prayer to be recorded in full was a petition, not for himself, but for his disciples and all who should believe in him, \"that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. . . .\" (John 17:21). As he hung on the cross his final request in behalf of the Roman soldiers who had carried out the orders to crucify him, was, \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do,\" (Luke 23:24).\nA life full of charity such as that of Jesus has no room in it for selfpity, intolerance, envy, or hate. It will not be overcome by pain, suffering, and sorrow, for it will always know the joy and spiritual renewal that accompanies love. Truly Jesus' yoke of love and charity is easy, and his burden light to those who take them upon themselves. LESSON DEPARTMENT 437 Literature The Bible in Our Literature Dr. Howard R. Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 ONE central purpose motivates this course. Its lessons are intended to help those who make an active study of them to get a clearer, more appreciative understanding of the vital role played by the Bible in the creating of our literature. Each lesson offers an alluring quest with-in this broad and fertile field. Rewards of devoted work will be more intelligent, more recreative reading, with greater skill to select literature really worth reading. From the class viewpoint, these rich returns will come only if the course as an air-pilot might say, is kept \"on the beam.\" Manifestly, in the limited time that can be allotted to the lessons, the main goal must be kept ever clearly in view. Each lesson, it is true, will prove an \"open sesame\" to treasures of literature; yet the natural temptation to linger too long over the gems, must be resisted by teacher and class member if the larger, spiritual end is to be attained. It is hoped, of course, that individuals and groups will be inspired to carry on beyond the classroom in further uplifting enjoyment of precious literature that is found. Both definiteness and flexibility mark the study plan. Every lesson, a unit in itself, helps to carry forward the central theme. It points the way to discovering how the Bible, in different ways, is woven with artistry into the type of literature with which the lesson deals. At the same time, it opens opportunity to draw freely upon not only time-tested literature but promising literature of the living present, for appropriate selections and quotations to add convincing concreteness to the main message to be impressed. Lesson 1. Our Literature Before the Bible Came A study reaching back into the legendary past?when our days were named ? and songs and sagas in vigorous, alternative lines were created. Typical selections from this folklore will be used in portraying the background of primitive thought, feeling, and ideals which were later to be illumined, shaped, and spiritualized through the influence of the Bible. Lesson 2. How the Bible Is Woven Into Our Literature A study of both the outward and inward phases of the shaping of our literature through the influence of the Bible. Such more tangible aspects, as Biblical allusions and expressions, as well as those more spiritual in nature. Biblical themes and ideals, will receive attention in this lesson. Lesson 3. Bible Influence as Revealed in Our Lyric Literature A study of typical songs inspired by stories and living truths of the Bible. Selections to impress the depth and breadth of its influence in the creation of our lyric literature will be made from the classic carols on through the years down to the present. Some precious lyrics will be included in the lesson for special consideration. Lesson 4. Bible Influence on Our Epic or Narrative Poetry This study will center attention on certain outstanding poet story-tellers who were markedly influenced by the Bible in their creative work. Chaucer, Milton, Tennyson, Longfellow are among these. A limited selection of their well-known story poems will be used to make the message of this lesson clear and concrete. Lesson 5. Bible influence in Our Drama This study, beginning with brief attention to the old plays created to impress Bible stories, will specifically deal with other dramas through the years centering around Biblical characters and themes. Attention will also be given to the influence of the Bible in shaping and spiritualizing dramas that grip and hold the hearts of humanity. Lesson 6. Bible Influence on Our Fiction This study naturally, like those preceding, must be severely limited to consideration of a few typical and worthy novels whose themes or central characters are essentially Biblical. Its range will be from tested earlier fiction to present creations which reveal classic qualities. Brief attention will be given to the more general spiritual influence on other worthy fiction. Lesson 7. Bible Influence on Essays and Oratory Again the scope of the lesson will be restricted to the study of a few inspiring types of the essay and to certain outstanding orations that show plainly Bible influence. These will be taken from past and recent literature of these two important kinds of expression. Reliance of great writers and speakers on the Book of Books will be made clear. Lesson 8. Bible Influence in Literature for Children A forward-pointing study to help parents get closer to the book companions of their children and grandchildren. Children's literature, except for Mother Goose and Fairy Tales, is mainly of more recent creation. What of the Bible influence is revealed in most of the books produced for children today? In this lesson, directed opportunity will be given to make some selective research to answer this question, and out of it to bring to our children more well-written, Bible-inspired literature of living appeal for them. Text and References First, the lessons themselves are to be the guiding text. Each of these units should be carefully studied by teacher and members of class. Questions for study should be thoroughly considered before the lesson is given; and the suggested activities carried through, both before and after the lesson. Second, for general references the following will be found most helpful: The Bible?King James Version (also Modern Reader's Bible ?\"by Moulton). General reference books may be added later. Note: Specific references will be given with each lesson. Lesson I?Our Literature Before the Bible Came For Tuesday, October 16, 1945 TN one of Longfellow's Tales of A Wayside Inn, \"The Saga of King Olaf' is a poetic portrayal of the bringing of Christianity to the \"Land of the Long Night.\" This old tale, first told to Longfellow, it is said, by the famed Norwegian violinist, Ole Bull, reveals that the message of our Master was carried into that stern realm not by any meek spirit, but by a hard-hitting viking. LESSON DEPARTMENT 439 Ringing lines from the lyric which opens the Saga, suggest the contest that lay ahead of this champion of the gospel. They sound also a keynote for this course. THE CHALLENGE OF THOR I am the God Thor. I am the War God\". I am the Thunderer, Here in my northland. My fastness and fortress Reign I forever! Jove is my brother; Mine eyes are the lightning; The wheels of my chariot Roll in the thunder, The blows of my hammer Ring in the earthquake! Force rules the world still, Has ruled it, shall rule it; Meekness is weakness, Strength is triumphant. Over the whole earth Still is it Thor's-Day! Thou, art a God, too, O Galilean! And thus single-handed Unto the combat. Gauntlet or Gospel, Here I defy thee! Following this vigorous lyric, in spirit and form suggestive of songs of the long-ago Norseland, comes a stirring ballad, sketching Olaf's adventurous youth, and a spiritual awakening which led to his leadership in carrying the cause of Christ into his homeland. Opening lines of this ballad are: KING OLAF'S RETURN And King Olaf heard the cry. Saw the red light in the sky. Laid his hand upon his sword, As he leaned upon the railing. And his ships went sailing, sailing Northward into Drontheim fjord. There he stood as one who dreamed; And the red light glanced and gleamed On the armor that he wore; And he shouted, as the rifted Streamers o'er him shook and shifted, \"I accept thy challenge, Thor!\" With swiftly moving lines, the ballad goes on to tell how Olaf's mother, Queen Astrid, after her husband, king of Norway, had been slain by a usurper, fled with her son to a haven with \"Hakon old\"; how, still pursued, she again fled, this time to be captured and enslaved. Later, Olaf as a boy was recognized and restored to freedom by an uncle. Then he became a roving viking, and finally converted in Sicily by a hermit, was baptized into Christianity. Fired with the purpose of avenging his father, reclaiming his realm, and spreading the gospel through the reconquered nation, Olaf had come with his ships and fighting followers back to old Norway. He would illumine that region of the 'long night\" with what had enlightened his own life. What the ideals, the inlook and outlook on life, of the rugged Northland folk were before Christianity came is mirrored in literature they created. Fortunately, in the Icelandic Eddas preserved for us, we have a wealth of their myths and legends, expressed in their vigorous, forthright style, to get us closer to their feelings and thoughts?their gods and heroes. And these same gods and heroes were in the main the very ones worshipped by not only the Scandinavian peoples, but by all Teutonic folk. In the Nihdungenlied a main source of the tales portrayed in the Wagnerian operas, are the same basic stories and characters as those in the Norse sagas. Anglo-Saxons, from whom came the English and Lowland Scotch, carried these tales across the Channel when they made their conquest of England. This, so far as we know, was their earliest literature. And it still is actively with us. Indeed, we pay something of tribute, though mainly without thought of it, to certain of the mythical Teutonic gods in our names of the days. Nature worship with something of mysticism seems woven into the conceptions of these deities of the Northland. Baldur, god of the sun, beloved for the light and warmth he brought to the Land of the Long Night, was honored in Sunday, first day of the week. Monday was named for Mani, a beautiful youth, who rode his shining steed, Alswider, across the night sky. Tyr, courageous war god, who gave an arm to assure the binding of the terrible Fenris Wolf, is remembered in Tuesday. Wodan, the all-father, with the ravens. Thought and Memory, on his shoulders, and with valiant heroes slain in battle, and beautiful shield-maidens, the Valkyries, ever about him, is perpetuated in Wednesday. Thor, fighter of frost giants, whose beard flares in the northern lights, whose eyes flash in the lightning, gave his name to Thursday. Freya, goddess of love and beauty, who rides through the sunny skies of spring and summer scattering flowers and fruits and bringing bird songs to cheer the northern realm, is remembered in Friday. Saturday, reserved for the last day of the week, comes from Surtur, fiery leader of the forces of evil, who, the gods ever feared, might break forth with destructive power in the last days upon their nine worlds. Confronted with conceptions such as these descriptions suggest, the bearers of our Savior's message had a difficult mission to implant principles of the everlasting gospel. Olaf, meeting Thor's challenge with blow for blow, succeeded in winning back his kingdom, and in making Christianity the official religion of his realm. Real conversion, as always, was a slower process. It had to come by weaving into the lives of the people the principles and practices of true religion. No small part of this was done through the infusion of the story and the spirit of the Savior into the national holidays. Yuletide, for example, which through untold years had been a time of feasting and drinking and wild revelry in celebration of the annual victory of Thor over the Frost Giants, was now commemorated as Christmas, in honor of Christ who came to bring \"Peace on earth, good will toward men.\" Easter, likewise, was made no longer just a celebration of the advent of spring, with joyous pageantry in honor of the beautiful goddess Oestara. It was a holy day in soulful remembrance of the resurrection of our Savior. Another profoundly significant phase of this spiritualizing development came through the intrinsic changes wrought in our literature. Just as the old gods of Greece and Rome fell in both a material and a spiritual sense as Christianity rose, so did the gods of the Northland rather suddenly disappear. Only in Iceland, separated from the mainland by about eight hundred miles of ocean, did the sagas persist in \noriginal form for some centuries. That is why these stories are best preserved in the Icelandic Eddas.\nLike the classic mythology of the Greeks, these sagas are, from in art viewpoint, great literature. They reflect the culture, the customs, the emotional life and ideals of that long ago. Something of a natural poetic skill was in the ancient skalds who created the strange stories. They had ample time to practice the art of story-telling during the long nights. And, since there was no printing press then, it had to be not story-reading, but story-telling.\nOne of the choice old tales out of the Northland impresses the basic value and the need for more such story-telling in our lives. In this mythical tale we are told that at one time, the gods, to commemorate a decisive victory over the Frost Giants, decided to create a man. It was agreed that, when the new being had been fashioned in his earthly image, each god should endow him with some precious gift. So they came, one after another to fulfill this pledge. One of the gods touched the lips of the newly created man that he might have the gift of speech; another touched his throat that he might sing. A third god touched his eyes that he might see; not only with his outward, but his inward or spiritual eye; still another touched his heart that he might have sympathy for all creatures.\nAnd, lo, when this man spoke, it was as no other had done before. In his words one could hear the song of birds, the whispering of the breezes, the roar of the ocean, the prattle of children. All the music of man and of nature at the same time. In wondrous voice, and he became the first poet.\nBasic truth is in this old tale. The poet does portray in musical lines the life he knows. In consonance with this, one feels through these sagas the courageous struggle with harsh elements?cold and darkness. Winds howl and breakers crash on rocky shores. Then comes ecstasy with the advent of the brief seasons of sunshine and revelry. Heroes of battle are extolled and tragedy accepted with something of a fatalistic attitude. Extravagant exploits are detailed, all to help while away the lengthened hours. In keeping with some of the \"tall tales\" and radio story-acting today, these old sagas were primarily for pastime. They gave entertainment?rather than recreation.\nHad our literary development stopped there, it would have never been completely soul-satisfying; Entertainment is wanted, but not that alone. What was lacking to round out and enrich literature of long ago was just what the Bible brought. It was an infusion of spirituality, new conceptions of life, the message of the Savior. That these stalwart folk of a new life came to bring to minds to new heights.\nDiscussion and Activities\n1. (a) Why may our English literature be said to have its roots in Teutonic lore?

Christensen Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 THIS is to introduce the second year's series of the social science lessons dealing with problems of social ethics. As suggested by the title, our chief concern is with modern applications rather than with historical or philosophical abstractions. The world today is in trouble, and the only way that it can right itself is by a return to virtue. Major principles of morality were outlined last year but, since each of these has such a direct bearing upon the problems we are about to examine, it is suggested that the class leader review the earlier lessons occasionally and use them whenever possible as background material for the discussions ahead. The lessons prepared for 1945-46 are built around certain modern problems to which the application of ethical principles is sorely needed. Titles and lesson aims are as follows: Lesson 8. Patterns of Prejudice and Persecution Lesson aim: To emphasize the prevalence of bigotry in the modern world and to show how its existence stands as a threat to democracy, Christianity, and the good life. Lesson 9. Problems oi Personal Conduct Lesson aim: To stress the importance of personal cleanliness, balanced conduct, and self control to the good life. Lesson 10. Leisure and Morals. Lesson aim: To demonstrate a relationship between modes of recreation and morality, and to suggest ways for improving the morals of society by making better use of leisure time. Lesson 11. Women and Morals Lesson aim: To analyze some of the social and moral problems peculiar to women in this modem world, and to emphasize woman's moral role and responsibility in the field of ethics. Lesson 12. Morals In Marriage and Family Relationships Lesson aim: To analyze our most basic social institution from the standpoint of moral conduct, listing some of the common faults, and pointing out some of the principles necessary for correction. Lesson 13. Some Broader Applications of Social Ethics Lesson aim: To examine some of the inequalities and inhumanities existent in the world today, and to show that justice, when not violated, leads to both peace and happiness. Lesson 14. Morality and the Church Lesson aim: To examine religion as a moral force in life; and to point out some of the pitfalls, as well as principles, in religious ethics. Discussion questions and references at the end of each lesson are given to stimulate and guide in a general way rather than to prescribe or limit the work of the class. The teacher should read as widely as is practicable, using Church literature day Saint viewpoint, eliminating, and library materials freely. But and adapting materials as the needs she will need to be discriminating and interests of the class reveal also; sifting according to the Latter themselves. Lesson 8?Patterns of Prejudice and Persecution For Tuesday, October 23, 1945 Lesson link: Last year's lessons in this department were based upon the belief that much of the world's sorrow and suffering could be alleviated by a quick and complete return to virtue. It has been through deserting the great moral principles of the ages that individuals and nations have got into trouble, and the only way that this trouble can be dissolved and real happiness brought to the earth is by an enriched understanding of moral principles and a genuine willingness to apply them in life. Lesson aim: To emphasize the prevalence of bigotry in the modern world and to show how its existence stands as a threat to democracy, Christianity, and the good life. PREJUDICE means pre-judgment on the basis of bias, or without sufficient examination or understanding of a thing. Persecution refers to the act of annoying, oppressing, or attacking someone else to cause him injury or suffering. Prejudice is a perversion of truth and persecution is a desertion of the brotherhood principle. Both are immoral.\n\"Why persecutest thou me?\"\nThese words of the Lord to Saul might well be applied to many of us in this modern day. Saul, it will be remembered, was prejudiced against the saints and had been persecuting them bitterly for some time. Then, while on the road to Damascus, he was accosted by the Lord who gave him to understand that persecution of the saints was at the same time a persecution of the Saviour. Saul repented, was converted, and later became an apostle in the church (Acts, chapter 9). But just as Saul offended city and worked against his own salvation by harming his fellow men, so do those today who, failing to catch the vision of a Christian world and the spirit of brotherhood which is an essential part of it, remain intolerant and antagonistic toward their fellow men. Selfishness, ingratitude, intolerance, discrimination, oppression?all of these and more are marks of prejudice and persecution. They are offensive to God and are a mockery of morality, and yet the world is full of them and their kind. Unless altruism can push aside selfishness, love outdo hate, and world brotherhood supplant provincialism and the exploitation of peoples, the future will not be bright and mankind will not find the peace and happiness to which it is entitled.\nPersonal Animosity\nWhen people become too self-centered they lose the \"social sense\" discussed in an earlier lesson, and through indifference and hate they neglect and abuse their fellow men. Egoism and arrogance lead to selfishness, antagonism, and oppression. The desirable person is the one who is interested in others; thoughtful of their needs, sympathetic with their sufferings, charitable toward their shortcomings, appreciative of their services, and helpful in all things. LESSON DEPARTMENT 445 Love, fellowship, and fraternity are basic in any system of morality. But many of us during some of the time, and some of us during most of the time, fall far short of this ideal. We verbalize the good life in our worship and then fail to actualize it in life. Practice, unfortunately, too, often lags behind preachment. How many of us, for example, give even when we are not asked to, and give unselfishly with no thought of publicity or personal advantage? It has been said that for some people \"faith, hope, and charity\" means merely having faith in the hope that they won't be asked to give charity. Society is full of handicapped and unfortunate people. How many of us are actively looking for them with the idea of doing something to help relieve their suffering? Or, in contrast, how many of us merely rest on the smug feeling of personal self-righteousness and figure that other people can take care of themselves. If the latter, we would do well to remember that self-righteousness is really not righteousness at all; moral action of the highest order is always oriented toward society. We are our brothers' keepers. The \"good Samaritan\" will always get closer to heaven than the pious but selfish egotist. When social relationships disintegrate farther than selfish indifference and neglect, when they become actively antagonistic and hostile, then all the more be the need for a return to virtue. When individuals become malicious and militant in their abuse of others, resorting to ill-willed gossip, slander, and other forms of attack, to destroy what they don't like, then morals take a holiday. No system of ethics can be built upon animosity and hate. Let us remember the words of Christ when he said, *'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you\" (Matthew 5:44). If we can love our enemies as well as our neighbors, as Christ enjoined us to do, then we will have no enemies?except the enemy of evil itself. And this, of course, is the good life at its best. Partisan Animosity But partisan animosities are just as prevalent and just as serious as personal ones, perhaps even more so. Religious persecutions furnish one of the clearest examples of this prejudice, intolerance, and persecution in the world today. Many pages of the world's history are bloody with accounts of religious persecutions and wars. It is not our purpose to recount these historical details here, but it is our purpose to point out that war and bloodshed are antithetical to the Christian ideal, and the very fact that there has been so much shedding of blood in the name of religion is evidence enough that this ideal has seldom if ever been reached. Jewish persecution, or anti-Semitism as it is called, has reached new peaks in ferocity and brutality during the last decade or so. Coming mainly from Germany, the movement has spread over practically all the world until now no place is entirely free from its vicious influence. Its spirit is one of hysterical bigotry as intense as the world has ever known. Already there are signs that anti-Semitism may be gaining momentum in America. May it never come! Anti-Catholicism is another example of religious bigotry. There are plenty of instances where individuals have been defeated in office or deprived of other opportunities just because they were Catholics. This should never be permitted to happen in America. Latter-day Saints have so long been the recipients of intolerance and persecution from the outside that they ought themselves to be some of the most tolerant people on earth. Knowing what it is like to be on the receiving end of bigotry and mob violence, we ought to be particularly kind and sympathetic toward other groups now. And perhaps we are. But a little critical group introspection wouldn't hurt, and if made honestly it might lead to the discovery that we are sometimes indifferent or even intolerant toward some of the minority groups suffering at the hands of the prejudiced. Tolerant participation is the answer to religious persecution. The solution to religious conflict does not require an acceptance of foreign dogma. But it does require a tolerant understanding of other groups' points of view and a willingness to work together even without complete uniformity or agreement. Conviction concerning one set of dogma should not preclude tolerance toward others. The Crisis in Morality Partisan animosity and bigotry by no means end with religious persecution, but our space is short and perhaps this will suffice to illustrate. The reader may wish to supplement this with additional examples from economics, government, or other fields. But the point that the very moral structure of our society is being threatened, due to bigotry and a tendency toward expediency, must not be lost. Both Christianity and democracy were founded upon the principles of equality and fraternity; their ideas were humanitarian and unitarian in nature rather than exploitive and individualistic. One need only search the scriptures and then compare them with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States to know that this is true. And yet we haven't been living that way; our practices haven't been in line with our professions; our actions haven't conformed to our ideals. Christians in name, we have nevertheless been quick to slander and' to persecute. Democratic in the framework of government we have nevertheless maintained our prejudices, fought for selfish vested interests, and discriminated against unfortunate minorities. All of this is undemocratic. It is also un-American, if we are big-souled enough to identify the American way with the right way. The crisis in morality is also a crisis in Christianity, and in democracy, and in the American way of life. The future of all of these institutions depends upon the victory of love over hate, altruism over selfishness, fraternity over bigotry. LESSON DEPARTMENT 447 Problems for Thought and Action 1. To provide a brief review of last year's lessons, show how happiness, progress, freedom, truth, honesty, and brotherhood all fit into an integrated moral system. Note: The class leader will find it advantageous to reread the last lesson from last year's series; i.e. Lesson 7, \"Brotherhood, the Key to Greatness.\" 2. What do we mean when we say that morality is socially oriented? What did Jesus mean when he said, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\" Discuss. 3. Distinguish between personal and partisan animosity and illustrate each. What should be our attitude toward the handicapped and the unfortunate? Why? Use scripture to support your position. 4. Give examples of anti-Semitism. Of anti-Catholicism. Of anti-Mormonism. Compare. Why should Latter-day Saints be particularly tolerant of other peoples? Are we more tolerant than other people? Give examples on both sides of this question and make suggestions for improvement. What is the solution for religious persecution? Discuss. 5. Do you agree that Christianity and democracy are ethical ideals that have not yet been reached? Make suggestions for reaching these ideals. Do you think that the world would then be any more happy? Any more moral? Why? Selected References Standard Works: Bible: Proverbs 16:16-19; Matthew 5:43-48; 6:14-15; 7:1-5; Mark 12:28-31.

And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER II Synopsis Delsa Marriott receives a letter from her fiance, Hugh Temple, with the army in Australia, asking her to release him from their engagement so that he can marry an Australian girl. Delsa is broken-hearted, and because her family and friends have long looked forward to this marriage, she hesitates to tell them that she has been jilted, and decides to keep this a secret until she can make up her mind whether or not to release Hugh. DELSA took especial pains with her looks the next morning. The little children had such sharp eyes, such inquisitive minds, such uninhibited interest in their teacher. Likely as not Rickey Graham would look at her sharply and say, \"You been cryin', teacher? You tell me what's wrong and I'll fix it!\" Ricky was genuinely fond of her. And there was Jeff Holden, his gray eyes kindly penetrating. She didn't want any questions, even unasked ones. During the night Delsa had made up her mind to one thing: she would not write to Hugh immediately. She would wait a little, think the matter over before she told him he was free. For she had thought of their engagement as he had done?as something as binding as a marriage vow. She had not gone out once, not even to a town dance, with anyone since Hugh left. She hadn't even thought of any other boy. Page 420 Now, by Hugh's own word, she was free to think, to look at others. Maybe she would find that she, too, had been blinded by their childhood friendship; maybe she would find that other men existed in this world. But whether she did or not, she would at least give herself time to think of a way to break the news to her family and friends; and she would give Hugh time to realize what he was doing?to realize that his letter had been a devastating thing to her?not a question to be decided lightly. \"But of course,\" Delsa whispered into her mirror, \"of course, Delsa, you can't keep him if he wants to be free. But maybe he doesn't. Maybe, if I play for time, he'll come back to his senses, his honest, smalltown senses, and to me!\" Careful as she had tried to be, Delsa had evidently not succeeded in making herself look gay and carefree. She knew this by the anxious look her mother gave her when she came into the big kitchen for breakfast?a searching look, followed by bright, casual remarks, with no reference to last night. The oatmeal was bubbling in its kettle on the stove, and her mother served her a bowl full of the steaming goodness. She poured over it the thick, yellow pan cream, saying, \"You're lucky, Delsa. You can eat all the cream and mush you want and not put on an ounce. It's using your brain does it, I always say. If we older women would just use our minds the way we did when we were young?\"\n\"Now, Mom!\" Delsa smiled, \"maybe it isn't that. Maybe it just takes oatmeal and cream a long time to work. These breakfasts will be showing on my hips some day?\"Don't you get to thinking that, Delsa. You need good food, the way you work and struggle with those kids. You eat that mush now.\"\nBut the mush didn't look good any longer. Not that she was worried about getting fat?not any more. What difference would it make? She would still be Miss Delsa, the school teacher, and her pupils wouldn't notice the gradually accumulating heaviness and slowness and dullness.\nShe threw a soft knit scarf over her light curls and went out into the March morning. She didn't look again into the mirror or she would have seen that the robin's egg blue of the scarf had deepened the blue of her eyes?and had deepened, also, the shadows that lay like pale wings below them.\nThe children ran to meet her, shrieking with joy, holding before them the bright paper pinwheels she had let them make yesterday. She laughed back at them, thinking what a pretty picture they made, running along the country road in the March wind with the red and yellow and green bits of paper whirling in front of them. Maybe, if she were an artist or a poet, she could catch this innocent gaiety and keep it, to remember that she, too, had once run free and gay with the wind and yellow pinwheels.\nJEFF HOLDEN was on the hill back of the school building with the eighth grade boys, flying kites. Jeff was principal of the two-roomed school, and teacher of the upper four grades. He was also scoutmaster, crafts instructor and friend of the adolescent boys, who were feeling the hardness of the war, too, since their older brothers and neighbors?their heroes and companions and instructors in normal times?had been called away.\nJeff saw Delsa and, waving at her, shouted, \"Not nine yet!\"\nShe nodded and cried against the wind, \"Nearly!\"\nJeff came running down the hill, lightly and easily in spite of his twenty-six years. His dark hair was rumpled by the wind and he was laughing, but his eyes, amazingly gray in his tanned face, were tired and serious. He looked at Delsa and said, lightly, \"That letter from Hugh?he's all right, I take it?\"\nDelsa smiled, \"Hugh's letters should be posted in the post office for all to read,\" she began, and then caught her words back, remembering what Hugh had written.\n\"All the boys' letters should, I maintain!\" Jeff agreed gaily, apparently not noticing the break in Delsa's sentence. \"In a town this size, where every boy is sort of neighbor-hood property, the letters from all parts of the world sort of belong to us all, don't you think?\"\n\"Well, the town does hear most of them,\" Delsa defended, \"They're read in Church?all that are proper to be read. Even in a town like this, the boys ought to be allowed to write some private news?\"\n\"Jeff laughed. \"Grand!\" He looked at his watch, whistled sharply. Henry Lake ran into the school building and brought out the big, old-fashioned bell and began to ring it with all his might. The children trooped down from the hillside, in from the road. Delsa went inside, sat down at the piano in the \"big room,\" and began to play a march. The pupils filed in, sedate and orderly in contrast to their actions outdoors. Going to her own room, she passed Jeff in the tiny hall that ran between the two classrooms. She paused a moment. ?You look tired, Jeff,\" she said, \"Anything wrong at home?\" He smiled at her. \"Trudy was sick last night,\" he explained. \"I don't know what is wrong with her all the time. Mrs. Reeder seems to know about babies and Davy's okay. But Trudy gets thinner and thinner.\" ?I?ll run over after school,\" Delsa promised. \"I'm no child expert, but maybe I can discover what's wrong. I don't think Mrs. Reeder's too bright, anyway, with babies.\" \"Now I have something else to think of,\" Delsa thought with relief. \"Poor little Trudy!\" And poor Jeff! Struggling as he was with two children and a housekeeper who was neither smart nor very conscientious. It wouldn't have been so bad before the war. If Jeff's wife, Lucy, had died in normal times, there would have been a dozen capable women in the town ready to help him out with his babies and his house. But now they had all gone to work at the phosphate plant in the next valley. A big bus picked them up every morning and brought them home every night ?good wages and clean work, different from the familiar drudgery of housekeeping. You couldn't blame them for taking the jobs, drawing the good pay, especially when they felt that they were helping win the war, too. Jeff's problem was a minor one in their opinion. Only Mrs. Reeder was left to help him, Mrs. Reeder, who had proved too inept for a job at the plant. But Jeff made the best of it, running his household with one hand while he managed the school with the other. Delsa knew that Jeff had been deferred officially on account of his farm, which was large enough and important enough to win him exemption. But he was doing an even more essential work in the school, and for less pay. The woman who had been principal had left to take a job in a war plant at more than twice her teacher's salary. The big boys had been getting obstreperous; the larger girls becoming a problem ?adolescents with the maturity of country children and the freedom and intimacy of a small town and a lack of supervision due to their disrupted home lives. So Jeff had stepped in and taken over the school and the whole town had felt the benefit?and would feel it for a generation or more, Delsa admitted to herself. But few of the townspeople seemed to realize what Jeff was doing. Oh, some of them reached out a friendly hand when they had time, but for the most part he was limping along practically unaided. Delsa decided to take more time from her own problems and her own activities to take a look at Trudy now and then. SHE was shocked when she entered Jeff's little house. Lucy had always kept it so sparkling and bright that Delsa had thought of it as a doll's house. Now the doll's house was in disorder?and dirty. Windows were unwashed, curtains hung limp. In a soiled bed Trudy lay whimpering. Mrs. Reeder was rocking and reading.\n\"Don't do no good to pick her up, Delsa,\" Mrs. Reeder complained. \"She just likes to bawl, seems like.\"\n\"She's wet and cold,\" Delsa said sharply. \"Where's Davy?\"\n\"Outside.\" Mrs. Reeder wasn't bothered by Delsa's implied criticism. \"He won't stay indoors, even if he has a cold.\"\n\"Call him in,\" Delsa ordered. She put a kettle of water on the stove, where the fire was burning brightly enough to keep Mrs. Reeder comfortable, and picked up Trudy. Anger surged through her at sight of the little girl. She was almost a year old?should have been rosy-poly and smiling and rosy, but she was thin and whining. What was the town thinking of to let a lovely baby like this?Jeff's and Lucy's baby?get into this shape? What ails, when Jeff stepped into the had she herself been thinking?\nDelsa shrugged. She had been working on her trousseau. Every afternoon and evening, sewing, crocheting, making things for her's and Hugh's comfort and pleasure. The other women had been at their own personal activities, too. They were all to blame, she, perhaps, more than the rest. Why hadn't Jeff complained? Why hadn't he shaken some sense into her?\nDavy came in, his muddy shoes making tracks across the dirty floor.\nDelsa put Trudy in the big kitchen rocking chair, so that Mrs. Reeder would not have a place to sit, and said, \"You watch her, Davy.\"\nShe set Mrs. Reeder to scrubbing the kitchen floor while she unmade Trudy's bed, hung the blankets and mattress on the line in the clean March wind, and hunted about for clean sheets and pillow case and clothing for the baby.\nWhen Trudy was bathed and warm and cooing with satisfaction, Delsa set her in her crib and started on Davy. He was a sturdy little fellow, evidently able to get the things he needed in spite of Mrs. Reeder's indolence. But he reveled in the attention, so the soapy bath, Delsa had then to curl under her brisk toweling, felt it looked exactly like his father's.\nJeff came in and whistled when he saw the activity. As teacher of the \"big room\" and principal, he hadn't been able to leave as early as Delsa had?he generally was at the building till nearly five?so the floor was scrubbed, Trudy was gurgling and Davey was laughing, rosy and clean in his faded blue coveralls, when Jeff stepped into the room.\nHe smiled at Delsa, and there was more than appreciation in that smile.\n\"Wonder woman!\" he grinned, and went on gaily, \"'And the touch of her deft fingers turned a shack into a home,' unquote.\"\nDelsa smiled back, but a little grimly.\n\"You've got to put your foot down with Mrs. Reeder,\" she said firmly. \"She must just sit here all day long and let these babies take care of themselves. Davy, bless his heart, is a capable little fellow, and hasn't suffered too much. But Trudy is going to be ill, Jeff, really ill, unless she gets proper care.\" \"I've been afraid of it,\" he said wearily, \"but what can I do? I do bathe them and feed them at night, but I just don't have time in the mornings. There are the chores to do-\" \"Aren't there any of the older boys that could help with those?\" Delsa asked. Jeff shook his head. \"They've all got more to do than they can manage. Why, that little romp on the hill this morning?fifteen minutes, all told, will have to be paid for by everyone of us with extra work tonight.\" He walked into the bedroom and picked up Trudy and held her close, rubbing his cheek against the soft down of her hair. \"Daddy's girl!\" he whispered. \"Daddy's girl can take it, even if she shouldn't be asked to. And he'll make it up to her some day, Trudy. That's a promise.\" Delsa felt the tears, sudden and sharp, behind her lashes. \"Jeff,? she said seriously, \"it's all right to promise, but you can't keep that promise, you know. You can't ever make up to a baby for lack of care in its first few years. It's now or never,\" He sighed, \"Then it'll have to be never, Trudy baby, because it simply can't be now. I can't do any more.\" Delsa replied, \"Look, Jeff. If you won't think I'm butting in where I have no right to be, I'll run over here for a half hour before school every morning and drop in again at night. I can tell Mrs. Reeder exactly what to do and see that she does it. If she thinks any one is checking on her, she'll probably work all right. Would you mind?\" \"Would I mind? She asks,\" Jeff said with wonder in his voice. \"It's a deal, then,\" Delsa said briskly. \"Now get your clothes changed and get those chores done. Mrs. Reeder will have your supper ready soon. I'll feed Trudy and then you'll be all right for tonight.\" Jeff handed her the baby and Delsa began to feed her hot oatmeal with whole milk and sugar. Trudy ate it greedily, making little hungry sounds as she mouthed the rich, warm food. Jeff, in his overalls now, came and stood in the doorway, watching them. \"I've never seen her eat like that,\" he said. \"She's a funny little chick,\" Delsa said, holding the warm body closer to her, \"She wants love and cuddling, Jeff, more than most babies do. She just has to have it?\" Delsa stopped, suddenly remembering that Trudy had been robbed of her natural source of comfort and love. And not only Trudy, but Davy and Jeff, too. Delsa glanced up at Jeff, and her heart constricted. Hugh! Hugh! She thought, why can't it be you leaning there in the doorway, watching? Why must I, too, be robbed of my love? She bent her head low over Trudy to hide her tears from Jeff. He turned slowly and went outside, and Delsa held the baby close, close for a moment. \"That is what I've wanted all the {Continued on page 447) LESSON DEPARTMENT Suggestions and Instructions on the Educational program COURSES for the coming educational year 1945-46, October through May, are as follows: Theology ? Church History (Continued). Visiting Teachers' Messages ? Sources of Strength: Charity. Literature ? The Bible in Our Literature. Social Science ? Modern Applications of Moral Principles (Continued). Again, as was the case for the educational year 1944-45, there are no special lessons outlined for use by the missions, since it is felt that all the lessons are suitable for use in the missions either as they are written or with slight adaptations. Moreover, according to present Church procedure in regard to lesson material taught by any auxiliary, all lessons to be taught must be approved by the Church Publications Committee through the General Board. This, therefore, renders it improper for missions or stakes to substitute lessons of their own choosing in place of the theology, visiting teachers' messages, literature or social science lessons which appear in Theand have been approved. The Goal of Relief Society Teaching Depending upon the skill of the teacher, many and varied methods of conducting a class period may be followed. All Relief Society teachers are not equally trained in teaching and many fine teachers have not had professional training. The best teachers, however, are always eager to improve their methods and make more effective their teaching. It is of paramount importance, however highly skilled a teacher may be, that she teach in the spirit of the gospel and give prayerful and conscientious study to her lessons. In addition, however, to the preparation of the lesson by a teacher, she should present it in such a way as to awaken in the members of her class a wish to study and gain knowledge for themselves. This desired end may be obtained by a variety of methods?by class participation either by an informal discussion, questions and answers, or by a more formal presentation such as a round table, panel discussion, etc., or by home study on the part of individual members. Whatever the means employed by the class leader, the result will be good teaching if both she and the Relief Society class members add to and increase their knowledge and strengthen their testimonies. Page  The lessons in the Social Science course for 1945-1946 \"Modern Applications of Moral Principles\" are to be taught in the light of revealed truth, as these principles have been set forth in gospel teachings. Special attention should therefore be given to the use of the references to Church literature found at the end of each lesson. In all Relief Society lessons the material taught must conform strictly to Church doctrine and belief. It is a great responsibility to undertake to teach a group of fellow Relief Society women. It is also a great privilege. From the hours of intensive study spent in preparation for each Relief Society lesson by a class leader come intellectual growth and a greater understanding of the gospel. May each class leader in the coming season do her utmost to impart knowledge to her class members and also awaken in them a desire to study and learn for themselves so that the testimonies of all Relief Society members may be strengthened. While lesson titles and lesson anus for each of the courses of study for the ensuing year are given in the previews, these are subject to change. Correspondence on Lessons Ward class leaders who desire help on any matter pertaining to a lesson should consult their stake leaders. Stake leaders desiring information may address such correspondence to General Board of Relief Society, Salt Lake City 1, Utah. It is not desirable to address communications either to the authors of the lessons or to any other Church office. Textbooks and Special References Textbooks should be supplied for the use of the respective class leaders from the funds of the Society. On the completion of the course the books should be returned to the Society for inclusion in the Relief Society library. If the special references are Church books, it may be desirable to purchase one or two for present and future availability. However, if the books do not hold lasting interest, it will be better to use library copies rather than to purchase books which will have only slight use. Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden (II Nephi 26:28). LESSON DEPARTMENT 427 Theology Church History Dr. H. Wayne Diiggs Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 A preview of the second year's course of study entitled \"Church History\" introduces the lessons for 1945-46. Titles for the next eight lessons and their objectives follow below. It will be remembered that the central theme for the course is to be found in the Savior's words \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" Again we shall look at the fruits of Mormonism and find them good. By way of review we may summarize the three parts of the course once more. Part I for 1944-45 was devoted to the opening dispensation of the fullness of times and had as its objective the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the coming of the \"church out of the wilderness\"; Part I for 1945-46 outlines the story of the saints in their movement to \"the place which God prepared\" in the tops of the everlasting mountains; Part III for 1946-47 pertains to the coming-of-age period of the Church with its broadened activities meeting the swift sweep of our modern times. The main objective of the course is to narrate the more important events of Church history and to consider the revelations in their relation to the historical episodes. We revere the revelations contained in the book of the Doctrine and Covenants as the revealed word of God for our day. The titles of the eight lessons for this year's course follow: 9. The Martyrdom oi Joseph Smith Objective: To indicate the worth of a great testimony and its supreme value to the onward development of the Church. 10. Brigham Young's CaJ] to Leadership Objective: To show the power of leadership under God. 11. The Journey Westward Objective: To trace the march of the saints westward and to show that physical hardships can more easily be endured by those who are supported by the spirit of the Lord than by those who are without his spirit. 12. Building an Empire in the West Objective: To indicate the beginning fulfillment of prophecy concerning the gathering of Israel. 13. Stakes oi Zion Increased Objective: To suggest the firm and sure way the Lord has of extending his purposes in the earth. 14. The Missionary System Broadened Objective: To develop the truth that the gospel is ours, but we must strive to share it with others. 15. The United Order Begun Objective: To show how the Lord strives always to have his children seek the more perfect social order of living. 16. The Building oi Temples Continues Objective: To show that God provides for the fulfillment of all his promises. In this second series of Church history lessons there will be need for the use of a book on Church history in addition to the Doctrine and Covenants which again is to be the text for the year. The book Essentials in Church History by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, published in 1942 by the Deseret News Press, Salt Lake City, Utah, is recommended. While the lessons, it is hoped, will set the central objective for each month for the reading and discussion period, yet these necessarily short bits of writing covering but briefly the far-reaching episodes of our history, will need additional source material to enrich the story of our Church and its revealed doctrine. Essentials in Church History can provide such an enlargement of the theme. Do not lose track of the place of the Doctrine and Covenants in this study. Here, the words you will read are the words of the Lord which ever illuminate the enduring principles of life. Through all the study let us not forget our repeating phrase from lesson to lesson?we must \"give heed unto his word\" which has been written especially for us in this day. As to the method of class discussion, bear the following in mind: Somehow in too many lessons practically all of the material is given in the written lesson itself. The teacher covers this part fairly well. When, however, she reaches the discussion period, she poses questions that draw a weak response. To this she must then supplement her own contribution. In overcoming such difficulty there is the necessity of putting real content into the discussion period. In the case of the present series, this is done by directing class members to the words of the Lord as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. Once a class, after attempting to answer a simple but searching question, is turned to the clear and convincing facts as phrased by the Master, hearts are warmed; and minds, seeking ready confirmation of truth, recall personal illustrations which press for expression. Testimonies result, and the teacher assumes her rightful role as director, rather than taskmaster of the hour. Text and References Doctrine and Covenants. Price $1.00.

He brought his wife and inhim and convey a very important fant son with him. Message, to present him with a copy John Henry Smith grew to man-\n\nPage  hood in Salt Lake City. One month after his eighteenth birthday, he was married to Sarah Farr, daughter of Lorin Farr of Ogden. The first child born to this couple, a son, named John Henry, died in infancy. On April 4th, 1870, a second son arrived who was named George Albert, after his paternal grandfather. Today, George Albert Smith is the honored President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the eighth man to hold that high and important calling since the Church was organized in 1830. President Smith grew to manhood in the Seventeenth Ward, Salt Lake City. In his home, he learned all those beautiful and impressive principles which have animated him throughout his life. His mother bestowed all the love and affection and tender care upon her children that it was possible for a woman to give. His father was a very exceptional and capable man, a true missionary and advocate of the principles of the gospel. When George Albert was ten years of age, his father, John Henry Smith, was chosen to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, following in the footsteps of his worthy and esteemed father. President George Albert Smith obtained his early education in the public schools of Salt Lake City. Later he was enrolled as a student at the Brigham Young Academy in Provo. There he came under the influence of that remarkable teacher, Karl G. Maeser, from whom he learned many valuable and impressive teachings which have remained with him through life. Returning to Salt Lake City, he took courses at the State University and continued his education. In 1892, shortly after his marriage to Lucy Emily Woodruff, daughter of Emily Jane Smith and Wilford Woodruff, Jr., George Albert left Salt Lake City on a mission to the Southern States. In a few months his wife followed him and together they performed their missionary labors, spending most of their time in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Elder Smith acted as secretary of the Southern States Mission. On being released in July 1894, Elder Smith returned to Salt Lake City and was employed by the Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution until February 10th, 1898, when he was appointed receiver of the United States Land Office for Utah by President William McKinley. He held this position until he was chosen a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at the October conference in 1903. Since he became an apostle, nearly forty-two years ago. President Smith has labored unceasingly for the welfare and advancement of the Church. It would require much more space than has been allotted to us here to enumerate his many activities. He has visited all the stakes and most of the missions of the Church. In 1919, shortly after the first World War, he was called to preside over the European Mission and in that capacity he traveled throughout Great Britain and on the Continent where the missions of the Church are located. On July 14, 1921, President Smith was released from his presidency in Europe. He returned at once to Salt Lake City and resumed his activity in the Quorum of the PRESIDENT GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 389 HONEYMOON AT NIAGARA FALLS President George Albert Smith and Lucy Emily Woodruff Twelve Apostles. Two years ago, he became the president of this Quorum following the death of President Rudger Clawson. He held this position until he became President of the Church on May 21st, following the death of President Heber J. Grant. Many honors have come to President Smith during the course of his busy life. AT Calgary, Canada, in 1913, he was elected president of the International Irrigation Congress. Lucy Emily Woodruff Smith, wife of President George Albert Smith, and their daughters: left, Emily Smith Stewart and right, Edith Smith Elliott. The following year at Sacramento he was again re-elected to the same position, and in 1915 at El Paso, Texas, he was named president of that organization. Two years later he was elected president of the International Dry Farming Congress at Peoria, Illinois, and elected president of the Combined Irrigation and Dry Farming Congress at Kansas City in 1918. For many years, President Smith was active in the organization of the Sons of the American Revolution, and was six times elected as vice-president general. In 1918 and 1919 he was president of the Utah Society of S. A. R. He was one of the organizers of the Utah Pioneer Trails and Landmarks Association, and has continued as president of the organization since that time. He has recently been appointed chairman of the \"This Is The Place\" Monument Commission which is directing the preparation of the monument to be unveiled during the Utah Centennial in 1947 at the mouth of Emigration Canyon, where the pioneers first entered Salt Lake Valley. President Smith became a member of the General Board of Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association in 1904, and served until 1921 when he was named as general superintendent. He stood at the head of this great Church auxiliary for fifteen years. This work brought him in touch with scouting, in which he has taken an extremely active interest. He has ranked as the highest scout official in the Church, being given the Silver Buffalo. He has served for years as a member of the national executive board, Boy Scouts of America. To know President George Albert Smith is to love him. He is friendly, kind, considerate, devoted, and does not harbor animosity towards any human being. More than any man we know he has that rare quality of soul which permits him to exemplify the teachings of the Savior when he said: \"Love your enemies; pray for them which despitefully use you. PRESIDENT GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 391 An index to his character may be found in a statement written by himself and published in the Improvement Era in January 1932.  I would be a friend to the friendless and find joy in ministering to the poor. I would visit the sick and afflicted and inspire in them a desire for faith to be healed. I would teach the truth to the understanding and blessing of all mankind. I would seek out the erring one and try to win him back to a righteous and happy life. I would not seek to force people to live up to my ideals, but rather love them into doing the thing that is right. I would live with the masses and help to solve their problems that their earth life may be happy. I would avoid the publicity of high positions and discourage the flattery of thoughtless friends. I would not knowingly wound the feelings of any, not even one who may have wronged me, but would seek to do him good and make him my friend. I would overcome the tendency to selfishness and jealousy and rejoice in the success of all the children of my Heavenly Father. I would not be an enemy to any living soul. Knowing that the Redeemer of mankind has offered to the world the only plan that will fully develop us and make us really happy here and hereafter, I feel it not only a duty, but a blessed privilege to disseminate this truth.\" President Smith's congenial happy home life was saddened, in November 1937, by the death of his dear and loving wife. Lucy Woodruff Smith was an ideal companion for her husband. THREE GENERATIONS, left to right: George Albert Smith V; George Albert Smith, Jr.; President George Albert Smith. (This photograph was taken in 1937) She was a childhood sweetheart, devoted to her family, loyal to her Church, sympathetic and helpful to President Smith in the multifarious duties which he has undertaken during his public career. President Smith has three children, one son and two daughters. They are George Albert Smith Jr., Assistant Dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration at Harvard University; Mrs. Emily Smith Stewart; and Mrs. Edith Smith Elliott of Salt Lake City. There are eight grandchildren. Our good wishes go with President Smith in the great responsibility which has come to him and we pray that his life may be extended for many years and that he may find joy and satisfaction in his labors. President George Albert Smith and four of his grandchildren, left to right: Nancy Lucy Elliott, President Smith, Shauna Lucy Stewart, Martha Re June Stewart and George Thomas Elliott.

            "content": "President J. Reuben Clark, Jr, Elder Albert E. Bowen Member of the Council of the Twelve EIGHTEEN years ago the senior member of a great engineering and contracting firm that had designed and built many of the mammoth works, public and private, over America, called at President Clark's Salt Lake City office. The visiting gentleman was entertained by the writer and informed that President Clark had recently gone to Mexico as special adviser to Ambassador Morrow. He said: \"I congratulate Mr. Morrow. Reuben Clark is a tower of strength to any one fortunate enough to enlist his services.\" Such is the appraisal, by one qualified through personal experience and association, and long accustomed to deal intimately with men of eminence in our own and other lands, of the man whose services have been for the last twelve years freely and unstintingly given to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a member of its First Presidency, and who now enters upon a new period of duty at the same post under the Presidency of George Albert Smith. Nor is the estimate above given a mere isolated instance of the high rating given to his ability and impeccable honor by men of high distinction with whom President Clark has worked. They include Presidents of the United States, Cabinet members representing the Departments of State, War, and Justice; members of the Supreme Court, and high ranking Army officials upon whose recommendation he was given the Distinguished Service Medal for exceptional accomplishments during the first World War. PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. On the flyleaf of the second volume of the second edition of the Selective Service Rules and Regulations coming from the press in 1919 Provost Marshal General Crowder inscribed: \"To Major Reuben Clark In recognition of devoted self giving in an absorbing and difficult task and of as fine loyalty to a cause as I have ever witnessed.\" His numerous influential and powerful friends in the East have found it difficult to understand his abandoning offers of lucrative association and worldly prominence for the relative obscurity of his position in the Church with its absence of all chance for material emoluments. But President Clark does not look upon this as a sacrifice. Page  Neither does he pose as a martyr to the Cause. The reason is simple. While being fully aware of the power of money and its ability to minister to physical comfort, he knows that its acquisition or possession is, in terms of life, of but incidental and trivial consequence. He is not over-awed by it, nor by the assumptions of those who possess it. The sponsor of injustice or wrong though buttressed by the prestige or arrogance of wealth or high station would meet with as short shrift at the hands of President Clark as would the meanest pauper. His powerful mind has a way of brushing aside all the overburden of superficiality or deceptive gilding and laying the basic issue bare at the roots. He knows, too, how ephemeral worldly honor and public plaudits are. He is not seduced by them away from the central purpose of life. He has unwavering faith that there is divinity and immortality in man and that life should be ordered on a plane compatible with these high conceptions. President Clark came direct from the lay field to a place in the First Presidency of the Church. That is to say, he had not been through a period of service in lesser official positions. But to Latter-day Saints, there is nothing incongruous about that. He had been reared in a Latter-day Saint home where the principles and practices of the Church were matters of everyday consideration and observance. He had grown to maturity in intimate participation in the affairs of ward and stake. From childhood he had absorbed the ideals, requirements, and doctrines of the Church. They were in the marrow of his bones. He is a meticulous student of the Bible and particularly the life and teachings of the Savior. He knows the other scriptures. Happily for the great body of the laity of the Church, and for their consolation, God has so provided that official position is not necessary to gaining of experience. Wisdom may ripen in lay service. The Lord seems to have the habit of drawing upon experience suited to the need of any time without regard to where the experience might have been garnered. President Clark's rich and varied experiences, coupled with his humility and fidelity to God and his work, have admirably fitted him to the needs of this time. All his powers and all his experience he lays at the feet of the Church to help guide it amid the scenes where it must do its work in the troubled days of a momentous era. The Lorelei, no longer confined to their native habitat on the banks of the Rhine, still sing their siren songs. Great wisdom and discernment, advantaged by wide experience in the ways of men and of nations are needed. Of the arts of blandishment he knows nothing. If honestly rendered service with whole-souled devotion to duty and unwavering fidelity to those who have honored him with their trust cannot win, he has no other means to employ.

            "content": "President David O. McKay Jeanette Morrell Visiting Teachers' Message Leader, Twelfth Ward, Mount Ogden Stake THE home into which President David O. McKay was born proved the best possible environment to prepare him for the responsibilities that have come into his later life. It was characterized by regular family prayers, harmony, love, and hospitality which was enjoyed by many Church and civic leaders. His parents directed his youthful development with faith and with sympathetic understanding. As a boy, he had his dog, a pony, pigeons, rabbits, and other pets. There was the old swimming pool which was a gathering place for the boys of the town during the hot summer days, and, later, his interests were centered in the baseball nine and in an orchestra in which he was pianist. With all these activities, incident to pleasant life in the country, there was still plenty of well-organized work which he shared with his father and brothers. There was also an unswerving rule that all attend sacrament, priesthood quorum, and auxiliary organization meetings, and that the Sabbath be respected as a day of rest. Thus, proper and lasting habits were formed in his early life and they have proved to be valuable ones. When he was twelve years old, he received a blessing from Patriarch John Smith, then on one of his regular visits at the Huntsville home. PRESIDENT DAVID O. MCKAY Among many other promises, the blessing said,  The eye of the Lord is upon thee. It shall be thy lot to sit in council with thy brethren and to preside among the people and exhort the saints to faithfulness. And thou shalt go forth wherever thou art sent by the Priesthood, like a roaring lion in the forest, none to stay thee, for the power of God shall rest upon thee and give thee strength, wisdom and understanding.\" At the close of the blessing, Brother Smith placed his hand on David O's head and said, \"My boy, you have much to do besides play marbles.\" Page  Thinking the Patriarch was suggesting that he give up the game entirely, he was quite perturbed and so expressed himself to some members of his family; for playing marbles was one of his favorite games and he was an expert in it. Only after his mother explained what Elder Smith really meant did he understand the meaningful remark. He was president of the class graduated from the University of Utah in June 1897, and, in August of that same year, left for the British Mission. Upon his return from a successful missionary experience, he commenced his career as a teacher first as an instructor in English and later as principal of Weber Stake Academy. In this latter position, he was not only an excellent teacher, but was father-confessor and spiritual adviser to hundreds of young people who still refer to him as the greatest influence in their educational and spiritual development. While directing the affairs of Weber Academy, he was called to the superintendency of the Weber Stake Sunday School Board. Under his supervision, a new era in religious teaching came into existence. The system of teacher-training, outlining lessons, and intelligent, organized presentation aroused new interest on the part of teacher and pupil, and brought deserved commendation from other churches and religious organizations. In 1895, \"\" became second assistant to President Joseph F. Smith who was then General Superintendent of Sunday Schools. In 1918, he was appointed General Superintendent, which position he held for years. Elder Bryant S. Hinckley said of him: \"He brought to the Sunday School work not only an undivided heart, but the strength and devotion of all his splendid powers. Through the Sunday School, he has fostered two major objectives of the Church  the development of faith, and the building of character.\" From these duties, he was made a member of the Council of Twelve Apostles on April 8, 1906. His years as president of the European Mission and his world tour of Latter-day Saint missions, in company with Brother Hugh J. Cannon, are replete with faith-promoting experiences, and were paralleled only by recorded history of similar trips made by the ancient apostles. Many bishops, presidents of stakes, and a large membership of the Priesthood remember his strong advocacy of a Church Welfare organization long before it became a church-wide movement. In this, as in his stake and general Sabbath school and missionary work, were manifest an earnestness and vision that always result in progress. His everyday life has been consistent with his teaching and preaching, and has earned for him the love and confidence of all who really know him. He stands for what he thinks is right regardless of opposition or criticism, but he is tolerant and charitable toward all whether or not they believe as he does. He loves deeply and tenderly, as his family and friends can testify. President McKay's wide experi-(Concluded on page 448)"

            "content": "President George F. Richards Elder Joseph Fielding Smith Member of the Council of the Twelve IT can be said of President George F. Richards, the newly appointed President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, what the Lord said of Nathanael, \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.\" There are, without doubt, many others who have given service to the Church and who are now giving service, just as true, just as loyal as President George F. Richards, but there are none, we may confidently say, who surpass him in the principle of loyalty, devotion and faithfulness to the cause of eternal truth. He was born February 23, 1861, in Farmington, Davis County, Utah. His early years were spent, as are the years of the average boy, on a farm, but he was also most active in the offices of the Aaronic Priesthood, and at an early age received the office of Elder and served as clerk of the Elder's quorum, ward teacher, in the presidency of the local M. I. A. And as stake missionary. March 9, 1882, he married Alice A. Robinson, and shortly afterwards moved to a farm in Plymouth, Boxelder County. In 1888 he moved to Tooele where he was ordained, January 29, 1890, to the office of High Priest and set apart as second counselor to President Hugh S. Cowans in the presidency of the Tooele Stake. Three years later, while serving in the stake presidency, he was ordained a Patriarch by Elder Francis M. Lyman, and in addition to the many duties in the stake presidency, he traveled through the scattered settlements of Tooele Stake giving blessings to all who sought them. In 1899, he was elected to the Legislature and represented Tooele County in the session of 1899-1900. PRESIDENT GEORGE F. RICHARDS He was also prominent in the civic affairs of Tooele County, on the district school board, as trustee and chairman of the Tooele Irrigation Company and the Tooele City Water Company. In December 1905, with his wife and son, Oliver, then a babe in arms, he accompanied President Joseph F. Smith and party to Sharon, Vermont, where the monument was dedicated to the honor of the Prophet Joseph Smith at the site of his birth, by President Joseph F. Smith just one hundred years after the birth of the Prophet. Page  The following year, April 8, 1906, he, with Elders Orson F. Whitney and David O. McKay, was called into the Council of the Twelve Apostles and was ordained by President Joseph F. Smith the following day. From that day until the present his life has been one of great activity, visiting the stakes of Zion, assisting in setting them in order, with the many special appointments and duties which his calling required of him. In the year 1916, he was called to preside over the European Missions, succeeding Elder Hyrum M. Smith. As the great war was on, his wife,4id not accompany him at that time because of the perils upon the water due to the activity of German submarines. He remained in Europe under the difficulties which arose due to the great world struggle, until he was succeeded by Elder George Albert Smith in June 1919. After the death of President An-thon H. Lund, in 1921, he was appointed to preside in the Salt Lake Temple which position he held until 1937, when he was released, because of numerous other responsibilities and because he had been appointed by President Heber J. Grant to act as Patriarch in the interregnum following the death of Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith. In his present calling as President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, he follows in the footsteps of his father, Franklin D. Richards, who also served as the president of the Council following the death of President Wilford Woodruff, when Lorenzo Snow was sustained as President of the Church, in September 1898. President Richards enters upon his duties as the President of the Council with the love, the faith and the prayers of all the members of the Church, well prepared by long and faithful service."

            "content": "Blanche Black Stoddard Gwendolyn H. Rosell First Counselor Bonneville Stake Primary Board CHARACTERIZED by Dr. Lynn Bennion while she was Bonneville Stake Superintendent of Junior Seminary as a \"radiant leader/' Blanche Black Stoddard, newly appointed Relief Society general secretary - treasurer, brings to her new assignment a great number of outstanding assets. She is an inveterate reader, a constant student of the gospel, and is blessed with a most charming personality, unusual executive and organizing ability, a delightful sense of humor and most valuable of all an understanding heart. Her fervent testimony and unwavering love of the gospel thrill young people and old alike. With her buoyant spirit, her talent as a speaker, and an unusual ability to remember names and faces, she has surrounded herself with a host of friends and is loved by all who contact her. Her list of friends includes both sweet-faced old folks and lively adolescents, for she has worked in every auxiliary in the Church. Sister Stoddard, born in St. Anthony, Idaho, the\" oldest of seven children, comes from hardy pioneer stock and was reared in a home where love for and devotion to the gospel and service in the Church were taught from babyhood. Her early life was spent in La Grande, Oregon, where she received a fine education in business and banking and where, when only nineteen years of age, she was called upon to act as president of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association. BLANCHE BLACK STODDARD She served for twenty years as ward and stake organist in La Grande and was also at various times Gleaner teacher, M. I. A. Stake representative, and counselor in the stake Relief Society. Her father, Charles J. Black, was a bishop in Oregon for some fourteen years and was then made a counselor to the stake president. Her widowed mother, Mary Ann Steers Black, who still resides in Oregon, has been an ardent worker in the Church throughout her life. She has known many trials and heartaches, but her loyalty to the gospel and her firm faith in the goodness of our Heavenly Father have always been beacon lights of inspiration to her daughter. Page 403 Blanche Black was married January 22, 1921, in the Salt Lake Temple to A. Lester Stoddard, a former South African missionary. He was a bishop in Oregon for six years prior to the family's move to Salt Lake City. He has always been a lumberman and at present is conducting his own business. He, also, is a zealous Church worker and his co-operation and backing are in a large measure responsible for his maverick's success. Both Brother and Sister Stoddard have always willingly accepted the calls to serve which have come to them in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints never seeking office, but always filling their appointments humbly, prayerfully, and well. They are the parents of four lovely children: Ann, the wife of Captain L. C. Reese, is now stationed at Phoenix, Arizona, with her husband and tiny daughter, Linda; Philip is a corporal with the United States Infantry in Germany; Sue will graduate in June from the East High School where she has been student body secretary; and Judith is a student at the Roosevelt Junior High School.\nA visit to the Stoddard home is a really pleasant experience, for there one finds a spirit of love, devotion, and co-operation home in the true sense of the word. The friends of the children as well as of the parents love to gather and always find a sincere welcome, a warm friendly feeling, and a wholesome homey time.\nSince coming to Salt Lake City thirteen years ago, Sister Stoddard has served on the Wells Stake Sunday School Board, the Bonneville Stake Primary Board, and taught Seminary in the Wells and Le-Grand Wards before becoming superintendent of the Junior Seminary in Bonneville Stake. During the past few months she has been invited to speak at numbers of Fire-side Groups and Gleaner classes on \"Temple Marriage,\" and has succeeded in implanting in the hearts of the young people she has addressed a desire for celestial marriage and its blessings.\nAlthough she has been outstandingly successful in each position as she has filled it, her heart for a number of years has been in Relief Society work. This is evidenced by her record as theology teacher in the Relief Society of the Seventeenth Ward where, for nine years, regardless of other appointments, she did not miss a single theology day. The Relief Society sisters know and love her as a brilliant teacher whose gospel background and pleasing lesson presentation afforded them hours of spiritual enjoyment and uplift.\nFour years ago she was called to preside over the Relief Society in LeGrand Ward and did her work so creditably that two years later when Park Stake was organized she was the sister selected by the stake presidency to preside over the Relief Society. Under her capable guidance Park Stake Relief Society has taken its place near the top in achievement.\nAll who know her ability and background are looking forward to outstanding work from her, and praying for our Heavenly Father's choicest blessings upon her in her new calling.\nSister Stoddard's thorough business training and extensive business experience will be of great value in her new calling. GENERAL BOARD OF RELIEF SOCIETY REORGANIZED 405In La Grande, Oregon, she gained her first business practice under the capable direction of her father in his real estate and insurance office. For three years she worked as bookkeeper in the United States National Bank of La Grande. Later she worked as paying and receiving teller. Recently, in Salt Lake City, Sister Stoddard has worked in the postal cashier department of the Federal Post Office, first as assistant to the time clerk and later as remittance clerk, in which position she was under heavy bond, being responsible for handling many thousands of dollars daily. Eager and untiring in her capacity for work, Sister Stoddard is a natural leader, capable of organizing and directing large groups of women. Her enthusiasm is contagious. Evon Waspe Peterson Leone G. Lavton Member of Relief Society General Board THE appointment of Evon Waspe Peterson to the General Board of Relief Society by the First Presidency will be welcomed by all who have associated with her. She brings to the service of the women of the Church a wealth of religious and business training. Always giving freely of herself, she has been a strength to the Church auxiliaries.

Smith Waspe, was born in Barham Green, England, and their father, William Waspe, in Ipswich. In response to the call of the missionaries to 'gather to Zion,\" they had completed preparations to leave England when Francis M.

Their desire, with hers, is that she may \"serve the women of the Church.\""

Steinicke President Ensign Stake Relief Society STRENGTH lies not in might, but in righteousness, and righteousness is one of the outstanding qualities of Leone Openshaw Jacobs. A capable and experienced Relief Society worker, she has charm and poise, seasoned with humility, a gracious dignity, sound judgment. And she lives the Golden Rule. Leone was born in Kaysville, Utah, a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth Raymond Openshaw, staunch Latter-day Saints. Her grandparents on both sides were pioneers for the gospel's sake. Leone attended school in Kaysville and graduated from Davis High School. It was while attending the University of Utah, majoring in education, that she met her future husband, Joseph Jacobs. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple, August 30, 1923. Due to her own inclinations and the fact that her husband is a high school teacher, Leone has continued her interests along educational lines. She and her husband have given generously of their time and talents in the various organizations of the Church wherever they have resided. A wonderful missionary experience came to Leone in July of 1938, when her husband was called to preside over the Palestine-Syrian Mission with headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. GENERAL BOARD OF RELIEF SOCIETY REORGANIZED 407 They took their children, Geraldine and Lamont, then eleven and seven years of age, and assumed missionary labors in the Holy Land. Here Sister Jacobs was mission mother and received great joy and inspiration from her work with the devoted saints and missionaries. The privilege of living amid the sacred surroundings of the Holy Land instilled in her a lasting appreciation of the gospel and the mission of the Savior. The latter part of 1939, they were called home because of the war, being among the last missionaries to arrive in the United States. Soon after coming home, Leone acted as assistant literature teacher in the South Eighteenth Ward Relief Society. In September 1941, she was called to the Ensign Stake Relief Society Board, under President Lucena R. Card, later becoming second counselor to Sister Card, and still later first counselor to Alice B. Steinicke, president of Ensign Stake Relief Society at the present time. In these positions Leone has proved her love for Relief Society by her devoted service. LEONE OPENSHAW JACOBS Quoting Sister Jacobs' words, \"Activity in Relief Society has brought me much joy, a greater testimony of the gospel, and many cherished friendships.\""

VELMA NEBEKER SIMONSEN Velma's virtues are as fixed and true as the four points of a compass. The magnetic north is her faith in God, her strong testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel, her orthodox religious life, and her missionary spirit. At right angles to her religious side is her willingness to serve. Another cardinal point of her compass is her genuine friendliness and optimism. Velma likes people and work. Page 408 As steady as the prevailing winds from the west are Velma's energy and enthusiasm. Her new assignment is the culmination of a long list of Church activities. For the past year Velma has been the energetic and lovable president of Yale Ward Relief Society. Previously she served as counselor in the same organization. As theology teacher in both Yale and Wasatch Wards she gave an eloquent interpretation of gospel doctrine. There are few positions in the auxiliary organizations in which Velma has not served. She has filled two missions in the Northwest, the first one in 1920. It was while teaching the Indian mission school in Montana that she met her husband, also a missionary. Velma Simonsen was born in Annabella, Utah, a daughter of Adelmon and May H. Nebeker, both of pioneer stock. She attended school in Sevier County and later at Brigham Young University. She also had \"le experience of teaching school in Sevier County. Her husband, John O. Simonsen, at present a high councilman in Bonneville Stake, served five years in the Yale Ward bishopric.

It shall blossom abundantly, And rejoice even with joy and singing (Isaiah 35:1-2), THE State of Utah, on her Centennial eve, should be ready to blossom, yes, to blossom abundantly. Let there be trees and lawns, shrubs and flowers. Let the whole State blossom as our planting dictates, as the rose, as the lilac, as the peony, as the lilies and poppies of the field. Remember this, however, unless we plant, there can be no blossoming. To this end, each person who loves his State should show that love by planting something to clothe her in beauty. Before blossoming can come, there must first be plowing and planting, hoeing and watering. Even before a sod is turned, there must be the mind's vision of what is to come. There must be patience, too oh, the long years of waiting before some flowers bloom! Our pioneer forebears showed us the way, with patience, with vision, with labor. The standards set by them are worthy ones for us today. They were fired by the injunction of their Prophet given in the stress and suffering of Jackson County, Missouri: \"Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness. Yea, verily, I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.\" Through all the hardships of the pioneers, there crystallized one yearning, a home again, in security, where they could worship as they pleased. In Nauvoo, they showed how they could make even a swamp blossom with real homes. But for many of the pioneers, as they trudged the weary miles to Salt Lake Valley, or waited at Winter Quarters, or in a foreign land, there was only patience and work and looking forward to the blossoming that was to come when they reached the Valley. And many of them went down into Death's Valley, instead of on to Zion. They died holding fast to a dream of homes, safe from enemies, and, in due time, the peace of shade trees and the joy of roses. But those dreams were not buried on the plains. Those who were permitted to come to the Valley worked with an added zeal, because of the true souls who had given their all, and it was not long before real homes began to blossom 'in the valleys. Stubborn soil was cultivated and made to produce food and clothing were urgent necessities. But not by bread alone did they live. Their homes held safe the treasures of the spirit. Beauty, as well as utility, was in their gardens. In those covered wagons were carried not only fruit trees and corn for the planting, but also rose bushes and geranium slips. With their own hands the pioneer built homes and filled them with handiwork and, seeing the State must be organized. Plans their work was good, then came the must be made. Page  UTAH STATE CAPITOL them with handiwork and, seeing their work was good, then came the joy and the singing. Now is the time for us to show that we appreciate our heritage and our desire to pass it on. As war conditions improve, cities, counties, and the State must be organized. Plans must be made. Work must proceed. As individuals we should not say,  I wish I could hire someone to make me a beautiful garden.  Do it with your own hands and there will be the joy and the singing. JULY Courtney E.

Wells, written by Augusta Winters [Grant]: We had a pleasant trip from Salt Lake to New York stopped at various points of interest along the way, not forgetting one lovely day at Niagara Falls.... Since our arrival we have been visiting most of the time in the vicinity of Bethel, and other small villages, situated on the Androscoggin in Maine I like this part of the country very much for summer. I never get tired of walking through the woods, where so many pretty wild flowers, ferns and mosses can be found, and the grandest trees, rocks and waterfalls..... both mother's health and mine is very good, and we have found many kind friends here. Notes and News: Sixteen women graduated this year from the medical department of the Iowa State University A California lady has discovered a process for pre serving the juices of citrus fruits with their natural flavor and without fermentation The bill requiring temperance, physiology and hygiene to be taught in the public schools was passed in the Massachusetts House of Representatives last Thursday. As from fairest fields of Eden, Floateth echoes of a song, Like the rainbow arch at even Bringing gladness after storm. So we clasp love's priceless token, Mark the summer passing by; Flowers bloom, and fruitage golden. Singing o'er \"sweet bye and bye.\",  L. M. Hewlings, Editorial: In childhood's days the very mention of \"Independence Day\" sent the blood tingling through our veins, and no exertion was too much to celebrate the memorable occasion. Have we forgotten these early impressions, and the patriotism we drank in with the very air we breathed? No, we have not; they are with us still, and the same love of liberty and consciousness of freedom to worship God, that we inherited as our birthright, still remains strong and dominant in our nature In America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, a land blest above all other lands, with a Constitution greater and grander than any upon the face of the earth, the Lord raised up in this age of the world a prophet, and gave him a message of life and salvation and a warning unto all people Too many of the forefathers of this people bled and died for that independence of which the stars and stripes are significant, and they know what the feeling of genuine love of country is, and feel it too deeply to make light of any of its symbols. Silent Communings by Hannah T. King: My other self and I have had a long colloquy this evening upon many deep and important subjects, upon which it is good to ruminate. I believe the meditations were caused by attending, a few days before.

Cannon Many Utah women worked untiringly for the passage of State Senate Bill 120, allowing school districts to increase taxation for schools variously from two to six mills. With more children to educate per thousand population than any other state in the Union, it is surprising that Utah stands among the foremast states in educational achievement. This is all the more remarkable when we realize that Utah's expenditure per pupil last year was $89, as against California's $166 and New York's $178. Mr. R. H. Manning, Executive Secretary of the Utah State Educational Association, was asked to explain this phenomenon before the meeting of the National Education Association. He attributed the situation largely to the teachings of the Latter-day Saints, which particularly stress service, and to the love of learning that dominates Latter-day Saint philosophy. FANNY HURST has been honored by receiving a scroll of merit from Frederick M. Thrasher, chairman of the Conference on Coordination for Youth Service, in commendation of her books, which present sympathetically modern young people, and which offer wise solutions to their problems.

ONE million American Girl Scouts have done more than twenty-three million hours' work to aid the war effort by serving as nurses' aids and farm aides, tending children, and assisting in hospitals by folding dressings and counting laundry. DR. ERNEST A. HOOTON, anthropologist of Harvard University, hopes that a woman will some day be president of the United States. He feels that women's innate honesty makes them better statesmen than men are. In 1884, and again in 1888, a woman (Belva Lockwood), was nominated for the presidency of the country.

            "content": "The New First Presidency THE women of Relief Society, along with tens of thousands of other Latter-day Saints, rejoice that even though a great and beloved leader, President Heber J. Grant, has been taken from our midst, another has been raised up to guide and direct the affairs of the Church. It is comforting to know that in these days of anxiety and sorrow the earth is not without a prophet, seer, and revelator, one appointed to receive and make known the will of the Father for his children on earth. It is not by chance nor by the whims of God or man that one is called to hold so exalted a position upon earth. The Lord has told us that he rules in the heavens above and in the earth beneath in all wisdom and prudence. He showed unto Abraham \"... The intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; Arid God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast bom\" (Abraham 3:22-23). Even though these great and noble spirits were chosen for their earth work before the world was, this is not enough. Page 414 They must prove themselves here; they must continue in righteousness as they live from day to day upon the earth. Thus President George Albert Smith comes to his position as head of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A great and noble spirit, born of goodly parents, he has devoted his life to the service of his fellow men and to the work of the Master. He has labored diligently in building the kingdom of God upon the earth. He has traveled far and wide carrying the gospel message by precept and example. He has sat in the highest councils of the Church, being ordained an apostle by President Joseph F. Smith when only thirty-three years of age. For the past two years he has been President of the Council of the Twelve. President Smith comes to the position of highest authority in the Church beloved by members everywhere. His tender nature, his kindly ministrations, his thoughtful considerations, not confined to the prominent alone, but extended to the least of God's children, often at the expense of great personal inconvenience, have won him a host of friends within and outside the Church. Blessed are the Latter-day Saints to have such a president in this day of tribulation.\nHis two counselors, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and President David O.

At the touch of his hand, she stood up and fitted into the curve of his arm while her hand slipped slowly up the shoulder of his dark coat. Their bodies moved together with the effortless grace of water.\nThe sky, through the high gymnasium window, was lighted by a full moon over which clouds moved like wind-blown thistle. A trumpet trio had stepped to the front of the stage and was harmonizing an old waltz. The lights were dim and these young people who had never learned to waltz, moved slowly, shuffling their feet, stardust in their eyes.\nBoys in uniforms with girls clinging to their arms stepped through the side doors into the night. But Felice and Chad continued dancing silently, easily, as if there were no time, no future, only the rhythmic moments.\nBut when the tune was ended they moved to join several other boys and girls. One of the boys said, \"Say, maybe we're lucky to be in engineering. For the time, at least, tonight is just another night to us. But to these other kids it's the last for a long time. They're trying to cram a lifetime into a few hours.\"\n\"How right,\" Chad agreed, easily, gaily, though Felice thought she saw the flesh darken above his white collar. He turned to her rather quickly and his arm tensed. \"Are we five?\"\nShe nodded, smiling into his brown eyes, and they moved toward the open door.\nONCE outside, their feet seemed automatically to go toward the south lawn of the campus where the maples in their riotous colors formed a parasol of lace over their heads, where the oaks and the silver birch stood quivering against the sky. They walked slowly, unhurried ly as they had done on many nights before, their hands clasped lightly together, a silence?deep and understanding?between them.\nFinally, she said, \"The boys look cute in their uniforms, don't they Chad?\"\n\"Fine,\" he agreed, then clearing his throat, \"It will seem strange around here with so many of them gone.\"\nAs they walked they saw couples in various places, a boy and a girl sitting close, talking in fast, incoherent sentences, trying to say things that would bridge the time until they met again.\nFelice repeated, \"Trying to cram a lifetime into a few hours. How can they know which are the important things to say? How could one choose?\"\n\"Yes, how?\" he repeated, steering her to the left until he brought her to a birch tree where they paused. \"Remember?\" he asked quietly, running his hand over the bark that had been cut with a sharp knife to form their initials. \"Weren't we silly? Page  Each trying to out-talk the other, both afraid we would never have another chance to say the things we felt.\" \"I suppose that's how it is with them tonight. They are afraid... And well they might be.\" \"Would you be afraid?\" he asked, leaning his tall length against the tree, looking down at her, a quizzical smile upon his lean features. \"Perhaps. I don't really know.\" \"What was it you said that first night, \"Love isn't a part of time.' \" \"Oh, that. I said, 'Love has nothing to do with time or space or age.' I must have read it someplace. And sophomores are so wise.\" He laughed shortly, \"And not wise at all when we are seniors. Who was it said that when he graduated from high school he knew it all but when he finished college he realized how much there was that he didn't know.\" \"I wonder if anyone ever feels that he knows a whole lot?\" she asked, her narrow forehead wrinkled becomingly. \"I'm sure I don't. And I doubt if anyone does in these times. But let's talk about us.\" \"There'll be plenty of time for that. In fact, there has been some little time spent on the subject... Or don't you remember?\" \"Sure do, lady,\" he assured her. \"But I'm just checking to be sure I remember rightly. Are you still taking good care of that frat pin I gave you? Does it mean as much as it did before?\" She looked surprised, \"Why, of course, Chad.\" He took her hands in his, \"Does it still make you dizzy when you think about me?\" \"But, sir, spare my blushes. Don't hold everything I say against me.\" There was laughter in the brown eyes she lifted to his and her wide, young mouth was parted softly. Suddenly, he pulled her to him and kissed her slowly, gently, then harder, hungrily, as though to solace a deep hurt or a dark fear. She drew back, \"Now, what good would thinking about you do, after that.\" He tweaked her ear, laughing gently, \"Come on, Twerp, if we hurry we can see Orion.\" \"Really. Isn't it funny you've been saying that every week for over two years and it still gives me the same thrill. Seeing those stars sort of puts us in our place.\" LATER, when they came out of the observatory building, they paused to let the wind brush cooling fingers through their hair. They looked down over the sleeping college town, the beloved campus, the blue hills to the west. She sighed, \"Another Friday night... Just like the others, yet somehow different. And now home.\" \"Just one more thing,\" he whispered, huskily, laying his hand on her silken hair, \"I love you.\" \"And I love you, Chad. Lots.\" \"I've got to tell you,\" he began swiftly, \"I'm going, too. I'm going with the others tomorrow. I enlisted. I should have told you but I wanted tonight to be just as the other nights had been. As long as you didn't know, it was okay. But... But, if you had known I would have been tempted to ask you to run away from the crowd tonight, to ask you to marry me . . . or something.\"\nHis words had followed on one another so quickly that her choked, \"Oh, Chad,\" had been lost in the web of them. Now, he stopped, holding her by the shoulders with his hands, looking intently into her eyes.\nHer voice caught in her throat as she asked, \"Could you have treasured anything more . . . than . . . tonight?\"\nHe lifted her chin in his hand, shook his head. \"No, Twerp. I'm sure of one thing, lifetimes can't be lived in that. It's like running backwards . . . you never quite catch\nup with yourself. I'll know you are here, waiting. That's enough.\"\n\"And I'll know, I'll know every minute, Chad, that you'll be coming back. Tonight will be doubly precious because it was just like other nights.\"\nThey looked long at one another, kissed. When he let her go, she said, \"There's just one more thing, Chad, . . . Your sister told me this morning that you were leaving.\"\nHe gave a short laugh before he whispered, \"You did joke!\"\nThen his fingers curled hard about hers, they started down the hill, a silence?deep and understanding?between them."

            "content": "The Martyrdom of Joseph Smith For Tuesday, October 2, 1945 Objective: To indicate the worth of a great testimony and its supreme value to the onward development of the Church. JOSEPH SMITH, prophet of the * nineteenth century, stood one January day in the year 1844 to address the newly appointed officers of peace for the city of Nauvoo. As mayor of the city he spoke, and within his voice was heard the prophetic tone of impending danger for himself and people. Some thirteen years had passed since the ?little flock\" who first believed this modern seer had gathered at the home of Peter Whitmer that April day in 1830 to organize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And what bright yet bitter years these had been! Half a continent had been spanned in the march of missionary endeavor. Yes, even the Old World, too, had heard the elders sent by express command of a latter-day prophet. Now around him thousands of saints had gathered, and had builded Nauvoo, the most beautiful of cities then to be found on the rich and fertile soil of Illinois. Could it be that the time had truly come when Zion was to rejoice and but hold in memory those trying days of Kirtland and Independence? His words on this January day seemed not to indicate this for he said:... I am exposed to far greater danger from traitors among ourselves than from enemies without, although my life has been sought for many years by the civil and military authorities, priests, and people of Missouri; and if I can escape from the ungrateful treachery of assassins, I can live as Caesar might have lived, were it not for a right-hand Brutus. I have had pretended friends betray me. All the enemies upon the face of the earth may roar and exert all their power to bring about my death, but they can accomplish nothing, unless some who are among us and enjoy our society, have been with us in our councils, participated in our confidence, taken us by the hand, called us brother, saluted us with a kiss, join with our enemies, turn our virtues into faults, and, by falsehood and deceit, stir up their wrath and indignation against us, and. Bring their united vengeance upon our heads. All the hue-and-cry of the chief priests and elders against the Savior, could not bring down the wrath of the Jewish nation upon His head, and thereby cause the crucifixion of the Son of God, until Judas said unto them, \"Whomsoever I shall kiss, he is the man; hold him fast.? Judas was one of the Twelve Apostles, even their treasurer, and dipt with their Master in the dish, and through his treachery, the crucifixion was brought about; and we have a Judas in our midst. (Essentials in Church History, pp. 360-361; D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 152) What group of traitors from within would now essay the role of Judas and, pincer-like, provide the other prong of opposition to join with those mobocrats, from without to encircle and destroy the Prophet and his work? Somehow the storm of hate which ten years before had set the cry in Missouri, \"the Mormons must go,\" now insidiously smoldered within the very councils of the Church. William Law, the Prophet's second counselor, together with his brother Wilson, William Marks, Leonard Soby, Robert Foster and others took offense at their leader's words and pulled away into a council of apostates who were secretly to pledge themselves to destroy Joseph Smith and his party; in fact, it was later discovered that William Law was in league with the Missourians who ever since the escape of the Prophet from their State had vowed to reach across the border line of Illinois and claim their man.\nRealizing the price God had set upon the strength of a testament, (Hebrews 9:16-17), Joseph Smith repeatedly forewarned his followers of his coming death, first by visioning the ultimate need of a land beyond the rim of the great western mountains to which the saints might press for safety; and second, through his frequent words concerning the threats upon his own life. At a conference in October of 1843 he said, \"This generation is as corrupt as the generation of Jews that crucified Christ; and if he were here today, and should preach the same doctrine he did then they would put him to death. I defy all the world to destroy the work of God; and I prophecy they shall never have power to kill me till my work is accomplished, and I am ready to die.\" (Essentials in Church History, p. 365; D.H.C. Vol. VI, page 58.)\nSome eight months following this meeting with the saints, Joseph Smith with his brother Hyrum was martyred in Carthage Jail, having calmly willed to surrender to the Prophet's enemies in the assurance that the true priesthood and spirit of the Lord necessary to establish the Church of Jesus Christ were again on earth. His courageous mission had made this so. Now the work of God was a living reality as evidenced by testimonies of hundreds of faithful and devoted saints. The story of the swift and final days ending with the death of the Prophet will ever live in the hearts of those who love him, for with the unselfish gift of his own life, they may now lay claim upon the force of his testimony.\nLet us briefly follow the steps of the story to see how boldly this modern seer of his own free will made the supreme gift for the Church of Christ he again established. It should be remembered that ever through the struggle to bring again the work of God in the latter days, the powers of evil bored from within as well as without. Men who at first were true, turned false, to join with those who ever hated the truth. With the increase of Church membership and the promise of peace and plenty for the saints mounting, fear and jealousy stole into the hearts of Joseph Smith's enemies. He had now become a figure of national interest. As lieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion, as mayor of Nauvoo, and as candidate for the office of President of the United States, prominent citizens sought him, wondered at his wisdom, and often inwardly feared the divine power of his office as prophet of God. Those who could curry favor of him for their own advantage did so, and those who feared, sought secretly either to work upon the ignorance and hatred of fanatical mobocrats to bring about his overthrow, or, by failure to act in the cause of justice, used their office to wink at infractions of the law. Thus because of the words of weak-willed officers, the saints suffered; their Prophet time and again was arrested, then arraigned before a court of justice to stand trial, only to be set free.\nSo between the cross fire of writs which shuttled back and forth between the Governors of Missouri and Illinois, he threaded his way in and out of the trials where enraged deputies lay in wait to ambush him. Such had been his lot up to that January in the year of 1844.\nDuring the months of February and March which followed, often his thoughts and acts were turned to constructive plans toward the fulfillment of the Rocky Mountain prophecy of August 6, 1842. It was decided to send some twenty-five men to explore all the mountain country, carrying the gospel message wherever they went. Any man who could \"raise $500, a good horse and a mule, a double-barrel gun, one barrel rifle and the other smooth bore, a saddle, and bridle, a pair of revolving pistols, bowie-knife, and a good saber\" might volunteer. Visioning the future of his people, the Prophet predicted that within five years the saints would be out of the power of their enemies, and asked that his\nwords might be written down that none \"need not say they had forgotten the saying.\"\nSpring of the year 1844 was to see events that led up to the fulfillment of Joseph Smith's predictions concerning his own death. Within this season came the dark combinations of apostates. Men who before had been high in the councils of the Church met at the fifth. Chauncey L. Higbee, Robert D. Foster, Joseph H. Jackson and Wilson and William Law together with Austin Cowles, Francis M. Higbee, Charles Ivins and Charles A. Foster were implicated in a conspiracy to kill the Prophet. When exposed, the first five named were excommunicated. Imbithered, they, with others, attempted to organize a church of their own with William Law at its head. Their efforts were doomed to failure. Frustrated, they then sought other means to satisfy their alleged plans, and they hit upon a malicious course of airing their hatred of the Prophet and his cause by means of the press. Their organ, the Nauvoo Expositor, appeared June 7, 1844. It was filled with vile slander aimed at Joseph Smith and many of Nauvoo's leading citizens. Striking at the most vulnerable spot in the body armor of saints, they attacked the Nauvoo Charter, a document of most liberal and far-reaching grants, under which the then thriving commonwealth on the bend of the Mississippi had come into being. The citizens of Nauvoo could not and would not accept this underhand thrust at their very existence. Within three days the city council met and declared the Expositor a public nuisance. The city marshal, John P. Greene, with a few men then proceeded to the printing office where they pied the type and burned the printed papers. The day following, Francis M. Higbee made complaint before Thomas Morrison, a justice at Carthage, for riot and destruction of the press. The warrant required the Prophet to go before Morrison or some other justice of the peace for trial. Here was the explosion the mobs were waiting for. Assemblies of mobocrats, speeches, resolutions, extermination orders for the \"wicked Mormons\" threatened the saints on every hand. Nauvoo was placed under martial law with its Legion mustered for protection.\nIn his effort to comply with the law, Joseph Smith appeared before Daniel H. Wells?a non-Mormon justice, but after hearing the case discharged the matter. Enemies of the Prophet claimed the trial was unlawful. It became necessary for Joseph to appeal to Governor Ford of Illinois for protection. In a letter dated June 16, the Prophet requested the Governor to make a trip to Nauvoo in order to halt the threatening danger of the saints. Ford came, but stopped at Carthage, where he surrounded himself with the worst apostates who, in league with the mobs, drowned any cry for justice. President Smith and all those accused were commanded to come and appear before Thomas Morrison of Carthage for trial, if not peaceably, then to the clank of muskets and force.\nJune 22nd found the Prophet with his brother Hyrum and eight of his close associates at a meeting in an upper room of his office. Shortly after the curfew hour, Hyrum came down from his room to the\nHouse to greet Reynolds Cahoon with these words, \"A company of men are seeking to kill my brother Joseph, and the Lord has warned him to flee to the Rocky Mountains to save his life. Good-bye Brother Cahoon, we shall see you again.\" (D.H.C. Vol. VI, page 547). It had been the decision of that evening to have the Prophet flee.\nThe next morning, the Governor's posse arrived in Nauvoo to find no Prophet. Shortly after noon that day, Emma Smith sent word by Orrin P. Rockwell to have her husband return; he having the night before just crossed the river. The most cutting part of the message bore the news that some of the leading brethren had accused the Prophet of cowardice. Realizing, then, that there would be those who would mistake the true reason for his departure, which was for the safety of his people, Joseph determined to return \"and see the thing out.\" Hyrum stood one with him.\nThe next day found these two brothers with the accused members of the city council and a few friends riding to the town of Carthage. Behind them the green and pleasant city of Nauvoo lay under the warmth of an early morning sun in June. The rattle of hoofs and the stretch of saddle leather talked their recedies. It was a company of about sixty mounted militia, under the command of Captain Dunn, who reined to a stop the little party. Orders were to have the Nauvoo Legion surrender all state arms. Meekness and might again had met. The Prophet spoke:\nI am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's morning. I have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward all men. LESSON DEPARTMENT 433 If they take my life I shall die an innocent man, and my blood shall cry from the ground for vengeance, and it shall be said of me \"He was murdered in cold blood!\" Essentials in Church History, p. 376; D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 555) Defenseless and at the mercy of their enemies, once more the saints found themselves as the hour of midnight saw their Prophet in Carthage ready to stand trial on the false charge of treason against the State of Illinois. The two days that followed are black upon the calendar of eternal justice. A Governor's broken pledge, an illegal summons, the impatient cruelty of a mob that would not wait for the law, all crowded the remaining earthly hours for the Prophet and Hyrum Smith as they sat in the Carthage Jail. It was after five on the afternoon of June 27. Elder John Taylor had just finished singing for the second time, at the Prophet's request, \"A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.\" There was a discharge of arms at the outer door of the jail. Dr. Willard Richards hastened to the window to see about one hundred armed men at the door, many with blackened faces. The guard at the door fired into the air, as a flying wedge of men burst through the door and up a flight of stairs into the room that held the Prophet and his party. Shouts rang out as a shower of bullets poured into the room. Hyrum Smith fell crying, 'l am a dead man.\" Joseph, struck by two balls, lunged for a window?to fall into a circle of murderers, his parting words a testimony, \"O Lord, My God!\" It was done. The testator of the latter day work had sealed his life's mission with blood to give enduring strength to the cause he championed. What greater gift could any prophet bestow upon his friends? Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first answer the question; second read the assigned part in the text to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word.\" The class period for this opening les-soTT can be a very challenging one. There is within the story of the martyrdom much to be felt as well as discussed. The great shock of learning how innocent men were struck down by the very ones who ought to have loved them for the words of life they had taught can but leave the heart hurt and the mind forever wondering. There can be no real end to the brutal story of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Such a lesson as this will bear rereading many times just as the tragic news bore retelling many times during those last days of June in the year 1844. I.

Bennion Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 MESSAGES for visiting teachers this year are based on Paul's masterful and inspiring discourse on charity found in I Corinthians, chapter 13. The subject is appropriate, for charity, as Paul defines it, lies at the heart of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Then, too, the Relief Society was organized, above all other reasons, to cultivate and express the spirit of charity. In this preview we shall consider the meaning of charity and give an overview of the messages which are to follow. What did Paul mean by the word \"charity\"? It is clear that its meaning was not restricted to almsgiving as it sometimes is today. This is evident from Paul's early statement: \"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\" To Paul charity also meant more than generosity and tolerance, attitudes which are implied in the expression?a charitable heart. Paul used charity as we use the word love. Such was the meaning of charity in 1611 when the King James translation of the Bible was made. More modern translations of the Bible use the word love because of the more restricted meaning which has come to be associated with the word charity. Thus \"love\" is a synonym for \"charity,\" although charity seems to have its own distinctive meaning as well (See Moroni 7:47). Love is the greatest principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. For this assertion we have the word of the Master himself. It is interesting to contemplate what a certain lawyer may have anticipated as an answer to the question he put to Jesus, \"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?\" Did he, perhaps, expect Jesus to quote one of the Ten Commandments? If so, he must have been surprised to hear the answer. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets\" (Matthew 22:35-40). The lawyer may well have been surprised, but not because these commandments were new, for they are included in the Mosaic law in Deuteronomy 6:5 and in Leviticus 19:18, respectively. The new thing in Jesus' restatement of these ancient laws was that he brought them together, made the second like unto the first, and made everything else in the Law of Moses and the Prophetic writings depend on these LESSON DEPARTMENT 435 two, on love. Love was to be the matrix, the warp and woof, and the heart and spirit of life. The apostle Paul, recognized for his faith in Christ, also knew that this faith must lead to love and must always be accompanied by love to be of worth, as he declared: \"... And though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.\" (I Cor. 13:2) \"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself (Galatians 5:14). A world ravaged by war and filled with hate is starving for love and charity. Children, parents, neighbors, fellow-Church members, the stranger within our gates, the widow, the orphan, the returning soldier, and our \"enemies\" all need the charity Paul describes. What do we mean by charity? How can we express our charity in daily life? These are questions to discuss through the year. The answers are suggested in this year's topics: 1."

JESUS said, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\" (Matthew 11:28-30).\nJesus had seen the yoke upon the oxen, how it aided them in pulling the plow. Thus, he likened himself and his teachings to a yoke which, if taken upon ourselves, would make it easier for us to bear the burden of life. More than anything else this yoke was to be the principle of Christ-like love or charity.\nThe life of the Master was big with love \"as a tree with blossoms in the spring.\" His charity knew no limits, no bounds, neither height nor depth. It was everything which Paul said of charity?patient, kind, free of envy, unselfish, courteous, sincere, enduring, and unfailing.\nJesus did not discriminate in expressing his charity for men. Only the self-righteous hypocrites came under his condemnation (Matthew 23). To the rest of mankind he gave freely of himself. When his disciples rebuked parents for bothering Jesus with their young children, \"he was much displeased.\" Moreover, he used the occasion to teach a great truth (Mark 10:13-16). So aware was he of the needs of people,\nthat he was sensitive to the touch of faith by the woman who dared only to feel his garment (Mark 5:24-34). Here again we may contrast the attitude of his less sensitive disciples who wondered that Jesus should discern a single touch in the midst of a crowd. Pharisees and scribes marveled and murmured because there \"drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him\" (Luke 15:1-2). Out of compassion he fed the weary multitude. (Mark 6) His last prayer to be recorded in full was a petition, not for himself, but for his disciples and all who should believe in him, \"that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. . . .\" (John 17:21). As he hung on the cross his final request in behalf of the Roman soldiers who had carried out the orders to crucify him, was, \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do,\" (Luke 23:24).\nA life full of charity such as that of Jesus has no room in it for selfpity, intolerance, envy, or hate. It will not be overcome by pain, suffering, and sorrow, for it will always know the joy and spiritual renewal that accompanies love. Truly Jesus' yoke of love and charity is easy, and his burden light to those who take them upon themselves. LESSON DEPARTMENT 437 Literature The Bible in Our Literature Dr. Howard R. Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 ONE central purpose motivates this course. Its lessons are intended to help those who make an active study of them to get a clearer, more appreciative understanding of the vital role played by the Bible in the creating of our literature. Each lesson offers an alluring quest with-in this broad and fertile field. Rewards of devoted work will be more intelligent, more recreative reading, with greater skill to select literature really worth reading. From the class viewpoint, these rich returns will come only if the course as an air-pilot might say, is kept \"on the beam.\" Manifestly, in the limited time that can be allotted to the lessons, the main goal must be kept ever clearly in view. Each lesson, it is true, will prove an \"open sesame\" to treasures of literature; yet the natural temptation to linger too long over the gems, must be resisted by teacher and class member if the larger, spiritual end is to be attained. It is hoped, of course, that individuals and groups will be inspired to carry on beyond the classroom in further uplifting enjoyment of precious literature that is found. Both definiteness and flexibility mark the study plan. Every lesson, a unit in itself, helps to carry forward the central theme. It points the way to discovering how the Bible, in different ways, is woven with artistry into the type of literature with which the lesson deals. At the same time, it opens opportunity to draw freely upon not only time-tested literature but promising literature of the living present, for appropriate selections and quotations to add convincing concreteness to the main message to be impressed.

            "content": "Our Literature Before the Bible Came A study reaching back into the legendary past?when our days were named ? and songs and sagas in vigorous, alternative lines were created. Typical selections from this folklore will be used in portraying the background of primitive thought, feeling, and ideals which were later to be illumined, shaped, and spiritualized through the influence of the Bible. Lesson 2. How the Bible Is Woven Into Our Literature A study of both the outward and inward phases of the shaping of our literature through the influence of the Bible. Such more tangible aspects, as Biblical allusions and expressions, as well as those more spiritual in nature. Biblical themes and ideals, will receive attention in this lesson. Lesson 3. Bible Influence as Revealed in Our Lyric Literature A study of typical songs inspired by stories and living truths of the Bible. Selections to impress the depth and breadth of its influence in the creation of our lyric literature will be made from the classic carols on through the years down to the present. Some precious lyrics will be included in the lesson for special consideration. Lesson 4. Bible Influence on Our Epic or Narrative Poetry This study will center attention on certain outstanding poet story-tellers who were markedly influenced by the Bible in their creative work. Chaucer, Milton, Tennyson, Longfellow are among these. A limited selection of their well-known story poems will be used to make the message of this lesson clear and concrete. Lesson 5. Bible influence in Our Drama This study, beginning with brief attention to the old plays created to impress Bible stories, will specifically deal with other dramas through the years centering around Biblical characters and themes. Attention will also be given to the influence of the Bible in shaping and spiritualizing dramas that grip and hold the hearts of humanity. Lesson 6. Bible Influence on Our Fiction This study naturally, like those preceding, must be severely limited to consideration of a few typical and worthy novels whose themes or central characters are essentially Biblical. Its range will be from tested earlier fiction to present creations which reveal classic qualities. Brief attention will be given to the more general spiritual influence on other worthy fiction. Lesson 7. Bible Influence on Essays and Oratory Again the scope of the lesson will be restricted to the study of a few inspiring types of the essay and to certain outstanding orations that show plainly Bible influence. These will be taken from past and recent literature of these two important kinds of expression. Reliance of great writers and speakers on the Book of Books will be made clear. Lesson 8. Bible Influence in Literature for Children A forward-pointing study to help parents get closer to the book companions of their children and grandchildren. Children's literature, except for Mother Goose and Fairy Tales, is mainly of more recent creation. What of the Bible influence is revealed in most of the books produced for children today? In this lesson, directed opportunity will be given to make some selective research to answer this question, and out of it to bring to our children more well-written, Bible-inspired literature of living appeal for them. Text and References First, the lessons themselves are to be the guiding text. Each of these units should be carefully studied by teacher and members of class. Questions for study should be thoroughly considered before the lesson is given; and the suggested activities carried through, both before and after the lesson. Second, for general references the following will be found most helpful: The Bible?King James Version (also Modern Reader's Bible ?\"by Moulton). General reference books may be added later. Note: Specific references will be given with each lesson. Lesson I?Our Literature Before the Bible Came For Tuesday, October 16, 1945 TN one of Longfellow's Tales of A Wayside Inn, \"The Saga of King Olaf' is a poetic portrayal of the bringing of Christianity to the \"Land of the Long Night.\" This old tale, first told to Longfellow, it is said, by the famed Norwegian violinist, Ole Bull, reveals that the message of our Master was carried into that stern realm not by any meek spirit, but by a hard-hitting viking. LESSON DEPARTMENT 439 Ringing lines from the lyric which opens the Saga, suggest the contest that lay ahead of this champion of the gospel. They sound also a keynote for this course. THE CHALLENGE OF THOR I am the God Thor. I am the War God\". I am the Thunderer, Here in my northland. My fastness and fortress Reign I forever! Jove is my brother; Mine eyes are the lightning; The wheels of my chariot Roll in the thunder, The blows of my hammer Ring in the earthquake! Force rules the world still, Has ruled it, shall rule it; Meekness is weakness, Strength is triumphant. Over the whole earth Still is it Thor's-Day! Thou, art a God, too, O Galilean! And thus single-handed Unto the combat. Gauntlet or Gospel, Here I defy thee! Following this vigorous lyric, in spirit and form suggestive of songs of the long-ago Norseland, comes a stirring ballad, sketching Olaf's adventurous youth, and a spiritual awakening which led to his leadership in carrying the cause of Christ into his homeland. Opening lines of this ballad are: KING OLAF'S RETURN And King Olaf heard the cry. Saw the red light in the sky. Laid his hand upon his sword, As he leaned upon the railing. And his ships went sailing, sailing Northward into Drontheim fjord. There he stood as one who dreamed; And the red light glanced and gleamed On the armor that he wore; And he shouted, as the rifted Streamers o'er him shook and shifted, \"I accept thy challenge, Thor!\" With swiftly moving lines, the ballad goes on to tell how Olaf's mother, Queen Astrid, after her husband, king of Norway, had been slain by a usurper, fled with her son to a haven with \"Hakon old\"; how, still pursued, she again fled, this time to be captured and enslaved. Later, Olaf as a boy was recognized and restored to freedom by an uncle. Then he became a roving viking, and finally converted in Sicily by a hermit, was baptized into Christianity. Fired with the purpose of avenging his father, reclaiming his realm, and spreading the gospel through the reconquered nation, Olaf had come with his ships and fighting followers back to old Norway. He would illumine that region of the 'long night\" with what had enlightened his own life. What the ideals, the inlook and outlook on life, of the rugged Northland folk were before Christianity came is mirrored in literature they created. Fortunately, in the Icelandic Eddas preserved for us, we have a wealth of their myths and legends, expressed in their vigorous, forthright style, to get us closer to their feelings and thoughts?their gods and heroes. And these same gods and heroes were in the main the very ones worshipped by not only the Scandinavian peoples, but by all Teutonic folk. In the Nihdungenlied a main source of the tales portrayed in the Wagnerian operas, are the same basic stories and characters as those in the Norse sagas. Anglo-Saxons, from whom came the English and Lowland Scotch, carried these tales across the Channel when they made their conquest of England. This, so far as we know, was their earliest literature. And it still is actively with us. Indeed, we pay something of tribute, though mainly without thought of it, to certain of the mythical Teutonic gods in our names of the days. Nature worship with something of mysticism seems woven into the conceptions of these deities of the Northland. Baldur, god of the sun, beloved for the light and warmth he brought to the Land of the Long Night, was honored in Sunday, first day of the week. Monday was named for Mani, a beautiful youth, who rode his shining steed, Alswider, across the night sky. Tyr, courageous war god, who gave an arm to assure the binding of the terrible Fenris Wolf, is remembered in Tuesday. Wodan, the all-father, with the ravens. Thought and Memory, on his shoulders, and with valiant heroes slain in battle, and beautiful shield-maidens, the Valkyries, ever about him, is perpetuated in Wednesday. Thor, fighter of frost giants, whose beard flares in the northern lights, whose eyes flash in the lightning, gave his name to Thursday. Freya, goddess of love and beauty, who rides through the sunny skies of spring and summer scattering flowers and fruits and bringing bird songs to cheer the northern realm, is remembered in Friday. Saturday, reserved for the last day of the week, comes from Surtur, fiery leader of the forces of evil, who, the gods ever feared, might break forth with destructive power in the last days upon their nine worlds. Confronted with conceptions such as these descriptions suggest, the bearers of our Savior's message had a difficult mission to implant principles of the everlasting gospel. Olaf, meeting Thor's challenge with blow for blow, succeeded in winning back his kingdom, and in making Christianity the official religion of his realm. Real conversion, as always, was a slower process. It had to come by weaving into the lives of the people the principles and practices of true religion. No small part of this was done through the infusion of the story and the spirit of the Savior into the national holidays. Yuletide, for example, which through untold years had been a time of feasting and drinking and wild revelry in celebration of the annual victory of Thor over the Frost Giants, was now commemorated as Christmas, in honor of Christ who came to bring \"Peace on earth, good will toward men.\" Easter, likewise, was made no longer just a celebration of the advent of spring, with joyous pageantry in honor of the beautiful goddess Oestara. It was a holy day in soulful remembrance of the resurrection of our Savior. Another profoundly significant phase of this spiritualizing development came through the intrinsic changes wrought in our literature. Just as the old gods of Greece and Rome fell in both a material and a spiritual sense as Christianity rose, so did the gods of the Northland rather suddenly disappear. Only in Iceland, separated from the mainland by about eight hundred miles of ocean, did the sagas persist in \noriginal form for some centuries. That is why these stories are best preserved in the Icelandic Eddas.\nLike the classic mythology of the Greeks, these sagas are, from in art viewpoint, great literature. They reflect the culture, the customs, the emotional life and ideals of that long ago. Something of a natural poetic skill was in the ancient skalds who created the strange stories. They had ample time to practice the art of story-telling during the long nights. And, since there was no printing press then, it had to be not story-reading, but story-telling.\nOne of the choice old tales out of the Northland impresses the basic value and the need for more such story-telling in our lives. In this mythical tale we are told that at one time, the gods, to commemorate a decisive victory over the Frost Giants, decided to create a man. It was agreed that, when the new being had been fashioned in his earthly image, each god should endow him with some precious gift. So they came, one after another to fulfill this pledge. One of the gods touched the lips of the newly created man that he might have the gift of speech; another touched his throat that he might sing. A third god touched his eyes that he might see; not only with his outward, but his inward or spiritual eye; still another touched his heart that he might have sympathy for all creatures.\nAnd, lo, when this man spoke, it was as no other had done before. In his words one could hear the song of birds, the whispering of the breezes, the roar of the ocean, the prattle of children. All the music of man and of nature at the same time. In wondrous voice, and he became the first poet.\nBasic truth is in this old tale. The poet does portray in musical lines the life he knows. In consonance with this, one feels through these sagas the courageous struggle with harsh elements?cold and darkness. Winds howl and breakers crash on rocky shores. Then comes ecstasy with the advent of the brief seasons of sunshine and revelry. Heroes of battle are extolled and tragedy accepted with something of a fatalistic attitude. Extravagant exploits are detailed, all to help while away the lengthened hours. In keeping with some of the \"tall tales\" and radio story-acting today, these old sagas were primarily for pastime. They gave entertainment?rather than recreation.\nHad our literary development stopped there, it would have never been completely soul-satisfying; Entertainment is wanted, but not that alone. What was lacking to round out and enrich literature of long ago was just what the Bible brought. It was an infusion of spirituality, new conceptions of life, the message of the Savior. That these stalwart folk of a new life came to bring to minds to new heights.\nDiscussion and Activities\n1. (a) Why may our English literature be said to have its roots in Teutonic lore? (b) In what ways are the mythological gods and heroes of the Icelandic Eddas and the Nibelungenlied kept in daily remembrance by English-speaking folk? Illustrate.\n2. (a) What essential message is given by these mythical gods? Illustrate. (b) Which of the Commandments does this story emphasize? What are the aims it turning folk from the worship of such deities? 3. Which lines in \"The Challenge of Thor\" suggest a basic cause for much of the conflict that has raged in the world from long ago until now? 4. What battle line in Europe was named for a Teutonic hero round whom an epic was created in legendary times? Tell briefly something of the story. 5. Olaf, as a fighting viking, opened the way for Christianity into his realm. What more was needed to bring the followers of Thor to accept and practice the gospel principles in their lives? Tell, for illustration, how their holidays were changed to help implant the story of the Savior, 6. (a) What is the basic difference between literature that merely entertains and that which brings real recreation? (b) To which type did the old Norse tales in the main belong? (c) What helpful guidance is greatly needed in our literature-reading practices of today? Suggested Activities 1. Read aloud the ballad \"King Olaf's Return\" in Longfellow's Tales oi A Wayside Inn, observing the viking spirit, the story, and musically descriptive lines. 2. Find some tale from the Northland and read it. In any of the following books, or some school reader, such stories may be found: Myths from Northern Lands, Guerber, American Book Co. Old Norse Stones, Mabie, Rand Mc-Nally Co. Age of Fable, Bullfinch, E. P. Button (Everyman's Library). Story of Siegfried, Baldwin, Scribners."

Christensen Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 THIS is to introduce the second year's series of the social science lessons dealing with problems of social ethics. As suggested by the title, our chief concern is with modern applications rather than with historical or philosophical abstractions. The world today is in trouble, and the only way that it can right itself is by a return to virtue. Major principles of morality were outlined last year but, since each of these has such a direct bearing upon the problems we are about to examine, it is suggested that the class leader review the earlier lessons occasionally and use them whenever possible as background material for the discussions ahead. The lessons prepared for 1945-46 are built around certain modern problems to which the application of ethical principles is sorely needed. Titles and lesson aims are as follows: Lesson 8."

Lesson 9. Problems oi Personal Conduct Lesson aim: To stress the importance of personal cleanliness, balanced conduct, and self control to the good life. Lesson 10. Leisure and Morals. Lesson aim: To demonstrate a relationship between modes of recreation and morality, and to suggest ways for improving the morals of society by making better use of leisure time. Lesson 11. Women and Morals Lesson aim: To analyze some of the social and moral problems peculiar to women in this modem world, and to emphasize woman's moral role and responsibility in the field of ethics. Lesson 12. Morals In Marriage and Family Relationships Lesson aim: To analyze our most basic social institution from the standpoint of moral conduct, listing some of the common faults, and pointing out some of the principles necessary for correction. Lesson 13. Some Broader Applications of Social Ethics Lesson aim: To examine some of the inequalities and inhumanities existent in the world today, and to show that justice, when not violated, leads to both peace and happiness. Lesson 14. Morality and the Church Lesson aim: To examine religion as a moral force in life; and to point out some of the pitfalls, as well as principles, in religious ethics. Discussion questions and references at the end of each lesson are given to stimulate and guide in a general way rather than to prescribe or limit the work of the class. The teacher should read as widely as is practicable, using Church literature day Saint viewpoint, eliminating, and library materials freely. But and adapting materials as the needs she will need to be discriminating and interests of the class reveal also; sifting according to the Latter themselves. Lesson 8?Patterns of Prejudice and Persecution For Tuesday, October 23, 1945 Lesson link: Last year's lessons in this department were based upon the belief that much of the world's sorrow and suffering could be alleviated by a quick and complete return to virtue. It has been through deserting the great moral principles of the ages that individuals and nations have got into trouble, and the only way that this trouble can be dissolved and real happiness brought to the earth is by an enriched understanding of moral principles and a genuine willingness to apply them in life. Lesson aim: To emphasize the prevalence of bigotry in the modern world and to show how its existence stands as a threat to democracy, Christianity, and the good life. PREJUDICE means pre-judgment on the basis of bias, or without sufficient examination or understanding of a thing. Persecution refers to the act of annoying, oppressing, or attacking someone else to cause him injury or suffering. Prejudice is a perversion of truth and persecution is a desertion of the brotherhood principle. Both are immoral.\n\"Why persecutest thou me?\"\nThese words of the Lord to Saul might well be applied to many of us in this modern day. Saul, it will be remembered, was prejudiced against the saints and had been persecuting them bitterly for some time. Then, while on the road to Damascus, he was accosted by the Lord who gave him to understand that persecution of the saints was at the same time a persecution of the Saviour. Saul repented, was converted, and later became an apostle in the church (Acts, chapter 9). But just as Saul offended city and worked against his own salvation by harming his fellow men, so do those today who, failing to catch the vision of a Christian world and the spirit of brotherhood which is an essential part of it, remain intolerant and antagonistic toward their fellow men. Selfishness, ingratitude, intolerance, discrimination, oppression?all of these and more are marks of prejudice and persecution. They are offensive to God and are a mockery of morality, and yet the world is full of them and their kind. Unless altruism can push aside selfishness, love outdo hate, and world brotherhood supplant provincialism and the exploitation of peoples, the future will not be bright and mankind will not find the peace and happiness to which it is entitled.\nPersonal Animosity\nWhen people become too self-centered they lose the \"social sense\" discussed in an earlier lesson, and through indifference and hate they neglect and abuse their fellow men. Egoism and arrogance lead to selfishness, antagonism, and oppression. The desirable person is the one who is interested in others; thoughtful of their needs, sympathetic with their sufferings, charitable toward their shortcomings, appreciative of their services, and helpful in all things. LESSON DEPARTMENT 445 Love, fellowship, and fraternity are basic in any system of morality. But many of us during some of the time, and some of us during most of the time, fall far short of this ideal. We verbalize the good life in our worship and then fail to actualize it in life. Practice, unfortunately, too, often lags behind preachment. How many of us, for example, give even when we are not asked to, and give unselfishly with no thought of publicity or personal advantage? It has been said that for some people \"faith, hope, and charity\" means merely having faith in the hope that they won't be asked to give charity. Society is full of handicapped and unfortunate people. How many of us are actively looking for them with the idea of doing something to help relieve their suffering? Or, in contrast, how many of us merely rest on the smug feeling of personal self-righteousness and figure that other people can take care of themselves. If the latter, we would do well to remember that self-righteousness is really not righteousness at all; moral action of the highest order is always oriented toward society. We are our brothers' keepers. The \"good Samaritan\" will always get closer to heaven than the pious but selfish egotist. When social relationships disintegrate farther than selfish indifference and neglect, when they become actively antagonistic and hostile, then all the more be the need for a return to virtue. When individuals become malicious and militant in their abuse of others, resorting to ill-willed gossip, slander, and other forms of attack, to destroy what they don't like, then morals take a holiday. No system of ethics can be built upon animosity and hate. Let us remember the words of Christ when he said, *'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you\" (Matthew 5:44). If we can love our enemies as well as our neighbors, as Christ enjoined us to do, then we will have no enemies?except the enemy of evil itself. And this, of course, is the good life at its best. Partisan Animosity But partisan animosities are just as prevalent and just as serious as personal ones, perhaps even more so. Religious persecutions furnish one of the clearest examples of this prejudice, intolerance, and persecution in the world today. Many pages of the world's history are bloody with accounts of religious persecutions and wars. It is not our purpose to recount these historical details here, but it is our purpose to point out that war and bloodshed are antithetical to the Christian ideal, and the very fact that there has been so much shedding of blood in the name of religion is evidence enough that this ideal has seldom if ever been reached. Jewish persecution, or anti-Semitism as it is called, has reached new peaks in ferocity and brutality during the last decade or so. Coming mainly from Germany, the movement has spread over practically all the world until now no place is entirely free from its vicious influence. Its spirit is one of hysterical bigotry as intense as the world has ever known. Already there are signs that anti-Semitism may be gaining momentum in America. May it never come! Anti-Catholicism is another example of religious bigotry. There are plenty of instances where individuals have been defeated in office or deprived of other opportunities just because they were Catholics. This should never be permitted to happen in America. Latter-day Saints have so long been the recipients of intolerance and persecution from the outside that they ought themselves to be some of the most tolerant people on earth. Knowing what it is like to be on the receiving end of bigotry and mob violence, we ought to be particularly kind and sympathetic toward other groups now. And perhaps we are. But a little critical group introspection wouldn't hurt, and if made honestly it might lead to the discovery that we are sometimes indifferent or even intolerant toward some of the minority groups suffering at the hands of the prejudiced. Tolerant participation is the answer to religious persecution. The solution to religious conflict does not require an acceptance of foreign dogma. But it does require a tolerant understanding of other groups' points of view and a willingness to work together even without complete uniformity or agreement. Conviction concerning one set of dogma should not preclude tolerance toward others. The Crisis in Morality Partisan animosity and bigotry by no means end with religious persecution, but our space is short and perhaps this will suffice to illustrate. The reader may wish to supplement this with additional examples from economics, government, or other fields. But the point that the very moral structure of our society is being threatened, due to bigotry and a tendency toward expediency, must not be lost. Both Christianity and democracy were founded upon the principles of equality and fraternity; their ideas were humanitarian and unitarian in nature rather than exploitive and individualistic. One need only search the scriptures and then compare them with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States to know that this is true. And yet we haven't been living that way; our practices haven't been in line with our professions; our actions haven't conformed to our ideals. Christians in name, we have nevertheless been quick to slander and' to persecute. Democratic in the framework of government we have nevertheless maintained our prejudices, fought for selfish vested interests, and discriminated against unfortunate minorities. All of this is undemocratic. It is also un-American, if we are big-souled enough to identify the American way with the right way. The crisis in morality is also a crisis in Christianity, and in democracy, and in the American way of life. The future of all of these institutions depends upon the victory of love over hate, altruism over selfishness, fraternity over bigotry. LESSON DEPARTMENT 447 Problems for Thought and Action 1. To provide a brief review of last year's lessons, show how happiness, progress, freedom, truth, honesty, and brotherhood all fit into an integrated moral system. Note: The class leader will find it advantageous to reread the last lesson from last year's series; i.e. Lesson 7, \"Brotherhood, the Key to Greatness.\" 2. What do we mean when we say that morality is socially oriented? What did Jesus mean when he said, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\" Discuss. 3. Distinguish between personal and partisan animosity and illustrate each. What should be our attitude toward the handicapped and the unfortunate? Why? Use scripture to support your position. 4. Give examples of anti-Semitism. Of anti-Catholicism. Of anti-Mormonism. Compare. Why should Latter-day Saints be particularly tolerant of other peoples? Are we more tolerant than other people? Give examples on both sides of this question and make suggestions for improvement. What is the solution for religious persecution? Discuss. 5. Do you agree that Christianity and democracy are ethical ideals that have not yet been reached? Make suggestions for reaching these ideals. Do you think that the world would then be any more happy? Any more moral? Why? Selected References Standard Works: Bible: Proverbs 16:16-19; Matthew 5:43-48; 6:14-15; 7:1-5; Mark 12:28-31.

            "content": "Missions to the Indians Elder A. William Lund Assistant Church Historian \n\nCorrected OCR Transcription\nTHE translation and publication of the Book of Mormon, a record of a part of Israel on this continent (now known as the American Indians), created a great desire on the part of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the early elders of the Church to visit some of the remnants of the Lamanites (as designated in the Book of Mormon) and preach the gospel to them and give them copies of the Book of Mormon. Upon making inquiry of the Lord respecting this matter, the Prophet, in October 1829, received the following:\nAnd now, concerning my servant Parley P. Pratt, behold, I say . . . I have appointed unto him that he shall go with my servants Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among the Lamanites. And Ziba Peterson also shall go with them yea, even as I have said, so it shall be. (D. & C. 32:1)\nMaking immediate preparations for their mission, these four elders visited some encampments of Indians near the city of Buffalo, New York, where they spent some time instructing them in the knowledge of their forefathers. These Indians were of the Cattaraugus tribe, and they received the brethren kindly. As some of their number could read English, two copies of the Book of Mormon were left with them. These elders continued their journey westward, preaching in the different villages through which they passed. At Kirtland, Ohio, they tarried some time, where quite a number in that vicinity believed their testimony and came forward and obeyed the gospel. Among these were Sidney Rigdon and a large portion of the church over which he presided. These missionaries were very successful in their labors and organized a small branch of the Church in Kirtland. One of these converts, Dr. Frederick G. Williams, accompanied the missionaries to Missouri.\nAfter leaving Kirtland, on their journey westward, they visited the Wyandot tribe of Indians near Sandusky, Ohio, with whom they spent several days. \"We were well received,\" writes Elder Parley P. Pratt, \"and had an opportunity laying before them the record of their forefathers, which we did. They rejoiced in the tidings, bid us godspeed and desired us to write to them in relation to our success among the tribes farther west, who had already removed to the Indian territory, where these expected to go.\"\nOn arriving at Independence, two of the company secured employment, while the other three crossed the frontier and began their labors among the Indians. They visited the Shawnees, spending one night with them, and the next day crossed the Kansas River and began their labors among the Delawares. They sought an interview with the chiefog the Delawares, known among the whites as Chief Anderson. Page  He was the ruler of ten nations or tribes, and consequently possessed great influence among the Indians. He had always opposed the introduction of missionaries among his people, and therefore did not at first extend a very hearty welcome to the brethern. Through an interpreter the brethren made known their errand and explained to him the Book of Mormon and the information it contained for his people. They asked to be heard before a full council of his nation, a proposition which the chief took under consideration until the next day. Next morning the conversation with the chief was renewed, but he was not inclined at first to call the council. As he began to understand better the nature 'of the Book of Mormon, he changed his mind and asked the brethren to suspend their conversation until the council could be assembled. A runner was dispatched to the tribes and in about an hour forty leading men were assembled and seated in grave silence to hear the message concerning the book of their forefathers. Oliver Cowdery, at the request of the chief, addressed the assembly. He told them that a history of their people had been faithfully kept by their prophets and wise men, Which was buried in the earth. This record had been brought forth and translated and published and the missionaries had brought some copies of the book, one of which he wished to present to the great chief. The chief replied that they would build a house and have the missionaries come and read the book to them. The missionaries spent several days with the people and considerable excitement prevailed when the news reached the frontier settlements in Missouri. The jealousy and envy of the Indian agents and sectarian missionaries were excited to such a degree that the missionaries were ordered out of the Indian country as disturbers of the peace and even threatened with military action in case of noncompliance. They left the Indian country and commenced laboring in Jackson County, Missouri, among the whites. Here they made several converts who were baptized and added to the Church. Thus ended the first Indian mission, in which the brethren had preached the gospel in its fulness and distributed the record of their forefathers among three tribes: the Catteraugus Indians, near Buffalo, New York, the Wyandots, of Ohio, and the Delawares, west of Missouri. The Prophet Joseph Smith later met with delegations of Sac and Fox and Potawatomi tribes, but there is very little recorded of these labors. During the troublesome times that the Church Went through, including the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother. Patriarch Hyrum Smith, there was not much work among the Indians. However, President Brigham Young established friendship among the Indians by his policy \"that it was better to feed the Indians than to fight them.\" Courtesy John Galbraith In 1854, Jacob Hamblin, with Ira Hatch, Samuel Knight, Thales Haskell and A. P. Hardy, were called to go to Santa Clara and there open a ' mission among the Indians. This mission reached into Arizona among the Moquis, Pimas and Navajos. No more thrilling tales of adventure can be found than in the life of Jacob Hamblin among the Indians. His honesty, fairness and friendly treatment of the Lamanites made them feel that he was their great friend. Jacob Hamblin spent most of his time from 1854 to 1877 in helping the Indians to a better life. AT the April Conference in 1855, forty-one missionaries, under the direction of Alfred N. Billings, were called by President Young to establish a mission among the Ute Indians, who resided in the vicinity of Elk Mountain, near Moab, Grand County, Utah. It is recorded that they were accompanied by Arrapeen, a converted ehief. The company consisted of forty-one men, fifteen wagons, sixty-five cows, thirteen horses, two bulls, one calf, two pigs, four dogs, twelve chickens and a splendid supply of provisions. Upon their arrival at their destination, they found about ten acres of land planted in corn, melons, squash and pumpkins. The seed had been secured by the Indians from an exploring party under the direction of W. D. Huntington, who had visited with the   Indians the year before. It had been planted in Indian fashion and the yield was fairly good considering the preparation of the soil. These missionaries built a fort, then started to clear the land for planting, and sought a location for a dam, which they knew they must have to bring water on the land. Soon they met St. John, Chief of the Elk Mountain Indians. The missionaries tried to show and teach the Indians the white man's way of working and living, as well as interesting them in the principles of the gospel. It was not long before the friendly Indians applied for baptism and on the 23rd* of July, fourteen men and women were baptized. Through the good work of Arrapeen, the neighboring Navajos visited the fort and asked to make peace with the Utes. As time went on more Indians were baptized and the brethren thought that all was going to be well with them. But as the crops began to mature, the Indians destroyed the potatoes and gardens of the pioneers. Then they started to steal the cattle belonging to the mission. The elders decided to change the location of the herd grounds so they could more carefully watch their animals. This angered the Indians and a skirmish followed, in which one of the Indians was killed. Chief St. John was their friend, but his son Charles led in the depredations and he and his followers threatened to kill every white settler. So the missionaries decided to return to Manti. Some of the friendly Indians accompanied them part way and expressed their desire for the white missionaries to live among them. Also in 1855, a site having been selected in the upper valley of the MISSIONS TO THE INDIANS 455 Salmon River Basin (now in Idaho) among the Bannock and Shoshone Indians, a company of twenty brethren, mostly from Salt Lake County, Utah, was organized with Thomas S. Smith as president. Traveling to Bear River, they continued through Malad Valley to Snake River until they reached the Salmon River Pass. On the 14th of June they selected a site on what is now known as Lemhi River. They immediately commenced to make improvements and soon had a blacksmith shop in working order, burned coal, and built a corral for the stock. Soon they had built seven houses besides breaking and planting several acres of land and doing considerable fencing. They called their location Fort Lemhi, in honor of Limhi, a Nephite king mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Assisted by the Indians, the settlement proved a success and the Indians, who were anxious to learn the white man's ways of agriculture, were assisted by the brethren. The families of the first settlers and others from Utah soon arrived. President Brig-ham Young visited the settlement in 1857. A second fort was built that year, north of the original fort, and a considerable amount of grain and vegetables was raised. In February 1858, while several of the brethren were busily engaged in mowing hay and hauling timber, a large party of Bannock and Shoshone Indians, many of whom lived around the fort and had previously been very friendly, made a sudden break upon the herd of the settlers, drove off most of the stock belonging to the fort, killed George McBride and James Miller and wounded President Thomas S. Smith and other brethren. This uprising of the Indians led to the abandonment of Fort Lemhi by Latter-day Saints later in 1858, the settlers returning to Utah. On the journey, Bailey Lake, one of the party, was killed by Indians on Bannock Creek. It is believed that this sudden Indian outbreak was caused by the fact that United States soldiers, under General Albert S. Johnston, were encamped near Fort Bridger in the winter of 1857-1858, engaged in a punitive expedition against the people of Utah, who were falsely charged with disloyalty to the United States. Misinformed in regard to this matter, the soldiers are said to have influenced the Indians to make trouble. Space will not permit of an article giving full details of the very great work accomplished among the Indians by the Church. Suffice it to mention that missionaries were sent among the Poncas in Nebraska and South Dakota, the Pueblo Indians in New Mexico, the Mohaves in Nevada and California, the Maricopas and Papagos in Arizona, the Zunis in Arizona and New Mexico, the Creeks in the Indian Territory, and the Utes and Shoshones in Utah and Idaho. TWO incidents are worthy of mention, showing the power of God that accompanied the missionaries in their labors. In 1857, Ira Hatch and Dudley Leavitt were among the Mohaves. These Indians showed a great dislike and distrust of the missionaries and planned their destruction. However, the humble prayers of these two brethren changed the Indians' attitude of hate to one of love and the missionaries did much good among that tribe. In 1878, Brother Llewellyn Harris was laboring among the Zunis. Smallpox broke out among the Indians, causing many deaths. Brother Harris administered to a very sick boy, who was healed. The Indians made known to Brother Harris their desire that he administer to all of their sick. He commenced to do this but found he could not reach them all so the sick were brought to a large house where Brother Harris administered to more than four hundred Indians. Through the mercy and blessings of God, following these administrations, most of the sick were made well. Successful wards of Indians have been established at Washakie, Utah, Indianola, Utah, and Papa-go, Arizona. Through the patient and loving help given by kind, good and faithful men and women, such as Bishop Hicks and his wife at Papago, the Indians have been made to realize the great blessings that the gospel has brought to them. May the day speedily come when more of these Lamanites may be brought to see the gospel truths and become as they once were \"a white and delightsome people.\" Indian membership of the Church in 1945 is estimated from 1,500 to 2,000.

            "content": "NAVAJO HEADDRESS William Luce 1. One of the distinguishing features of the Navajo is his headdress, This same headdress is worn by both the men and women and is especially striking because of its simplicity. Many now use the modern comb but a few still use a bundle of tied together instead. The hair, comb, and strands of yarn are only requisites for milady's hair-do, The two women are the wife and daughter of Jack Frank who sometimes reside at Blanding, Utah. 2. After a thorough combing, the hair is gathered together. 3. Then the center of the yarn is twisted around the hair close to the head. 4. The two ends of the yarn are held by the younger squaw while her mother rolls the hair by lapping it over and over. 5. The rest of the yarn is now twisted around the knot of hair and tied. 6. And the finished coiffure! More songs were sung, and as the fire began to die and children slept, the violin and all present sang \"The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning\" and truly it was! Dawn brought a gorgeous, shimmering Sabbath atop the mountains. There were bacon and eggs salted with sand and flavored with smoke. There was the clang of sheep bells, and the cook at the neighboring camp calling \"Come and get it.\" And then All gathered in a circle in a grove of shining, silver-coated aspens. What a temple! Carpeted with tall spreading ferns, embroidered with pink, gold and purple flowers, it was topped with a turquoise sky! The purple, red, yellow, and orange blouses and shirts of the participants stood out in gay relief against the green above and beneath. What a picture I beheld as I looked up the sloping stage where Brother Ralph Evans, President of the Navajo-Zuni Mission, stood, with hand raised in welcome, and waiting beside him was the violinist, Clarence (Joe) Hunt, with bow ready for action. The latter was a friend of President Evans, from Blanding, whom he had not seen since \"swimming hole\" days. Instantly I pictured them as boys holding their noses and going down into the water in a splash of boyish ecstasy. Now they stood before me, clean, tall men fired with divine enthusiasm, ready to \"feed my sheep.\" A grove of aspens has always suggested the Sacred Grove to me, and that thought raced through my mind just as the violin softly played \"Oh How Lovely Was the Morning\" and Mary Jumbo and her two girls sang the words beautifully. Then George Bloomfield told the story of Joseph Smith's first vision; of his receiving and translating the plates; of Christ's coming to the American continent; of Moroni's promise; and then he very forcefully urged these people to appreciate their book, and closed with his testimony. There was a brief pause after Clyde, the interpreter, finished. Then little, quiet, shining-eyed, immaculately dressed Sister Polacca stood up and told of a manifestation which brought her into the Church. I had heard this related several times before, and it was now told exactly as it had been told on every occasion before, but the setting, the aspen filled grove, and her big, brown eyes looking deeply into my soul as she spoke, gave me the impulse to take her into my arms and crush her to me and bathe her with my grateful tears. Thus I did at the close of the meeting. People wept unashamed, and everyone knew that she had spoken the truth and that she was a choice spirit touched by the divine and raised up to lead her people in the path of righteousness. Then the white people were asked to move back, and every Navajo sat at her feet while she told of this manifestation all over again in her native language.\nThe meeting was closed, and as I gathered the children and trudged up the hill to its lunch, a feeling of resentment filled me at the thought of breaking so fine and perfect a spiritual thread to perform the earthly task of eating.\nThe afternoon meeting was rich with testimonies of both white and Navajo missionaries. Children of both races sang and spoke. We had been together a long time, and the white people were showing signs of fatigue. President Evans said, \"The sun is getting low, and you are tired. I'll leave it to you shall I talk to you or shall we go home?\" An old, white-haired Navajo man slowly uncrossed his legs and said, \"When the sun goes down, the moon will come up, so let us have the talk.\" What philosophy, and how we whites need it in this rushing world! After the talk, the natives still wanted more and the war news was given them.\nThe long-looked-for conference was over; farewells were said, and we were the last to leave. It had all been perfect. As we reached the summit, there came, almost as a grand finale, the form of a huge, shaggy brown bear and her cub crossing the red-gold path of the setting sun."

            "content": "Not to the Swift Olive M. Nicholes ELSA WAYNE sat huddled beside her husband in the high wagon seat, cradling her sleeping baby in the curved shelter of her weary body. The wagon tossed and rolled like a ship in a heavy sea as it toiled over boulders or floundered through the engulfing sand. Dust rolled up from the wheels ahead of them, from the wheels behind them,  an inescapable red cloud, the length of the wagon train. It mingled with the yell of teamsters, the crack of whips and the patient plod of many hoofs.\nShe glanced up at the man beside her. All the familiar contours of his features were hidden in a wilderness of beard. He turned gentle eyes upward and reached out a comforting hand.\n\"We're almost theyah, honey. You'll nevah regret comin', once you see the land. Theyah's no end to it. It's like Alabamy an' Cal'liny good cotton country. It'll be home, honey, the Dixie of Deseret.\"\n\"Not my home!\" she muttered with stiff lips.\nOh, no; not her home! She glared about at the unfamiliar landscape as the dust rolled away and the wheels bit into the solid black lava of the ancient flow winding its tortuous way from the sleeping volcanoes to the northwest. Far to the northeast gigantic blocks and pinnacles were tumbled together in a gorgeous welter of color. Vermillion, bright ochre, orange, mauve and purple glowed and shifted in the sunlight.\nShe clung with terror to the man whose rapturous gaze shut her away, out of his new life.\n\"Jim,\" she choked, \"what is it? Let me see, too!\"\nHe turned and took her in his arms, \"Theyah now, honey, ain't no call fo' you all to be afeared. It'll all look different in fifty yeahs. Homes an' farms an' cattle fillin' up the valleys. I reckon they'll be churches an' schools an' a temple, too.\"\nFifty years! Her weary eyes searched for a glimpse of familiar substance. The mountains where were her mountains?\nMountains lay at the core of her being. Born and reared in Switzerland, she had become a part of their permanence and beauty. They embodied the undeniable triumph of righteousness. It had been the vision of mountains that had swept her into the new religion among a peculiar people in a faraway land.\nThe Valleys of the Mountains! That had been her acolyte. It had lifted her up through privation, hunger and despair, from Missouri to Nauvoo, from Winter Quarters to the West.\nShe had met Jim at Winter Quarters, a convert just from the South. She had been drawn to him as to a magnet, big, dark, and handsome, with a swift, rare smile and a voice at once slow and decisive. He had been attracted by her vibrancy and fair, shy beauty. Her eyes had been a corn-flower blue, her red hair with promise. Her sunny hair had hung in a flaxen rope, as big as his wrist, almost to her knees. Page 461 She had been full of hope, then. She had been the one to encourage and sustain. Her unquenchable laughter and sweet singing had captivated everyone on that April morning when they joined the caravan. She, who had faced incredible suffering with fortitude, cringed, now, in abject fear. CHE rolled back the curtain of the years and plodded again behind the handcart. The brazen sunlight beat down from a bow! Of blue glass. The baked earth held it and threw it back, intensified, against their aching bodies. Jim, already sick and faint with hunger, staggered and dropped in the trail. The cart behind turned out and rejoined the one ahead. The last of the few wagons, carrying the sick and dying, rolled by, the driver leaning to her with a comforting word. She had not begged for a place for Jim. She knew without asking there would be no room. So many sick, so many dying, and now Jim! There had been a tangled clump of bushes, a heap of broken rocks, where a persistent trickle of water bubbled up to be swallowed, instantly, by the thirsty sand. She pulled Jim into the meager shade and rolled the handcart alongside the embankment to shield him from the merciless sun. Then, piling the bedding and sacks of clothing on the hard ground, she eased him tenderly to the makeshift bed. The driver of the \"sick-wagon\" limped back and propped a shovel against the cart. He bent over the sick man, felt his pulse, then straightened up and started across the shimmering prairie. He had loved Jim as a brother. They had come up from the south together, poling their way on a flat-boat, crawling on hands and knees through thicket and swamp. Now he turned and staggered away with a hopeless sag to his shoulders. The living must go on! She had watched him top the rise and disappear. She had turned, then, searching the vast sweep of prairie with anguished eyes. Not a moving thing in sight., \"O God, spare my Jim,\" she begged, kneeling beside the sick man and clasping his hot fingers in her own. She gathered a few dead twigs and leaves and set a tin cup of water over the blaze she had kindled from tinder and flint. She would scald some scorched crusts and perhaps the tang of the hot liquid would staunch the ebbing tide of strength. If there were only a piece of beef to make a nourishing broth! They had seen no meat in weeks. They dared not go in search of game; lone huntsmen fell easy prey to skulking Indians. Indians! The thought crashed into her consciousness . She heard no sound, but they slid up around her, thirty or more, hideous with war paint, filthy with grease and grime. All thought of self was swallowed up in her misery for Jim. Now she could die with him. She rose and faced them in dazed expectancy. A big buck stalked to her side, his one good eye focused on the man on the ground. He pointed to Jim. \"Heap sick,\" he grunted, squatting down beside the cart, and squinting into the dying face. She nodded, stupefied with wonder that she could be alive at all. His black eye swept over the cart with beady interrogation. From an exposed corner of the box a torn pillowcase displayed the bright embroidered folds of her great-grandmother's table cloth.\n\"Gimme,\" he demanded, snatching the gorgeous linen from its wrappings. He shook out the gay fringed length of it and watched it dip and ripple about his feet.\nShe felt instinctively that he understood English better than he would admit. He seemed familiar with the skillet, the pots and pans, the canister of salt and sugar. Somewhere, sometime, his contact with the white man had been merciful and kind.\nHe unfastened a buckskin pouch at his belt and sifted a fine trickle of dried leaves into the water, simmering on the dying embers. A pungent aroma billowed up with the steam as he tilted the cup back and forth to mix the darkening liquid. Satisfied, at last, he raised it to his lips and blew a gale of breath into the scalding brew. He gulped a swallow and squinted up at her.\n\"Heap big medicine,\" he grunted, stooping over Jim. He poured the stimulating draught between the parched lips. The liquid bubbled and welled out. The Indian clamped Jim's lips together in the vise of his cupped palm until the overflow seeped slowly back. He poured in more and more until only the gray leaves fringed the cup.\nThe dying eyelids flickered and drew apart. Recognition broke through the glazed film of death. The stiff jaws worked and the broken mouthful of soundless words\nShe flung herself down beside him and gathered him into her hungry arms while the circle of impatient eyes darted from the heap of bright embroidery to the buckskin pouch and back again.\n\"Gimme,\" the Indian demanded, snatching up the cloth and depositing the pouch in her lap.\n\"Yes, yes!\" she choked, nodding her head in vigorous affirmation, so that her sunbonnet fell back and dropped to the ground. The flaxen web of her hair escaped and flowed over her shoulders and billowed around her feet.\nThirty pairs of gimlet eyes bored into her scalp. An excited clamor arose. The big chief snarled a command and they shrank back against the hill as motionless as the rocks.\nThe chief stooped and clutched handfuls of the silken skeins and pressed them against his face.\n\"Gimme! Gimme!\" he shouted, his one eye alight with greedy anticipation.\nShe laid Jim's head tenderly on the pillows and drew the blanket over his relaxed and sleeping body. Was it not enough that God had taken him back to her, that he would reach the mountains? Should she risk their lives and lose all with exclaim! demands? Her people were starving, dying on their scanty rations. They must have meat for their wasted bodies if they were to reach the Valley and work for the redemption of Zion. How much dare she ask? Her thoughts flew wildly about like startled birds, beating their wings against the cage of her exhausted brain.\nThe old chief spoke to his braves who stripped themselves of ornaments and laid them at his feet. He pressed them into her arms until beads and shells and feathered finery spilled over her knees in a rainbow flood of color. \"No want,  she cried, springing up and crowding the barter into his reluctant hands. \"Meat meat plenty meat!\" Her arms swept a wide arc of abundance. He slammed the trinkets at her feet and jerked a knife from its beaded scabbard. \"No meat/\" he snarled, \"no can find meat.\" Across the prairie a cloud of dust spurted up from an arroyo as a thousand buffalo hoofs scrambled to the plains above. A shaggy, black mass, scarcely discernible in the distant haze, rumbled slowly out of sight behind a low hill. \"See! See!\" she shrieked, gesticulating madly. \"Meat plenty meat!\" The disgruntled savages turned in wonderment, stiffened and sprang to life. The old chief barked commands as they scrambled for their possessions and disappeared behind the hill. \"No kill! No take!\" she demanded of the waiting chief as she gathered her hair together and divided it into strands. Her knees turned to jelly and her legs threatened to crumble under them when Jim muttered in his sleep. She stiffend to his need and then began to plait the strands of her hair toether, her sensitive finger-tips guiding the intricate pattern until she could pull the thick rope of it over her shoulder and braid it to its tapering end. Drawing a buckskin thong from her pocket, she knotted it securely at the nape of her neck and motioned for the Indian's knife. At her signal he leaped forward and grasped the completed braid, slipping the knife between her hair prickling scalp. She felt the cold steel pressed against her flesh, heard the squeal of the blade slicing through the resisting strands. He stepped back with a satisfied grunt and held up the severed prize. He fastened it to his scalp-lock, swung the embroidered cloth over his shoulders, and strutted away to retrieve his pony from the broken rocks. She watched the old savage ride off in the wake of his diminishing braves, her great-grandmother's tablecloth billowing out beneath her flaxen braid that whipped out frantically in the wind. She turned and rekindled the fire and made fresh brew from the strange herb. She repacked their possessions, concealing the shovel from Jim's questioning eyes. Please, God, let it dig no more graves in the lonely trail! At last the long day wore itself out. Cool breezes whispered through the sunburned prairie grass. Jim awakened from his healing sleep. \"The Indians! Elsa was it a dream? I can't recall \" \"No, mine Jim,\" she whispered, tears splattering down on the thin hands that stroked her cheek. She jerked off her sunbonnet to confirm the wild tale. \"Oh, my brave Elsa, my ,\" he had staggered giddily to his feet and held her close in his wasted arms. He had been proud of her then. He had boasted of her courage to the terrified band hiding in the willows by the river when she and Jim had staggered into camp with the incredulous news. The company had seen the In-(Continued on page 496)"

            "content": "The Vacant Lot Something Must Be Done About It Randall L. Jones Special Representative to the General Manager, South-Central District, Union Pacific Railroad\n\nCorrected OCR Transcription\nTWO years from now Utah will celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of the arrival of the pioneers in Salt Lake Valley.\nJuly 24, 1847, a small, but determined group of men, women and children, the vanguard of the Mormon pioneers, paused as they emerged from Emigration Canyon for a brief survey of Salt Lake Valley. Led by Brigham Young, they had traveled a thousand miles in search of a new home. After a few minutes study of the Valley, Brigham Young said, \"THIS IS THE PLACE, DRIVE ON.\"\nThat night, around a camp fire, a tired, thankful, happy band of pioneers sang songs of praise, offered prayers of gratitude, and made a promise \"We will make the desert blossom as the rose.\"\nJust what we can do to honor the memory of that brave vanguard centennial cannot at present be determined, but the love trek of tens of thousands of people traveling under the conditions they faced, the conquering of an unconquerable desert, and the building of an empire far from the fringes of civilization, all add up to an event that had a profound bearing on this nation's history, and the hundredth anniversary of such an event cannot by any measure being recorded the finest celebration that conditions will permit.\nWe would like to invite the world to join in a great celebration. This 1937 legislature proposed a plan for a World's Fair, that Utah might put her national parks, and other scenic attractions on display, and bring people from the far corners of the earth to behold the natural wonders of which we are so justly proud. Before such a plan can be carried out, the war now being waged must end, and travel restrictions lifted. Then, like the careful and proud housewife who is expecting company, we will give the State a thorough house cleaning.\nThe most serious problem we face in this house-cleaning and rose-blossoming job is the vacant lot. All of us always a night-mare to every community. It is in charge of cleanup campaigns, and the citizen who is proud of his home town.\nEvery home owner has some pride in his property, and will occasionally clean up the place, even though it takes a lively beautifying campaign to awaken that pride, but there is no one living on the vacant lot, and none of the care of the property washes his hands or the vacant lot, he is merely regarding its appearance. Page  BEFORE AND AFTER Rubbish accumulates rapidly, soon it becomes an ugly spot growing more unattractive daily. The vacant lot is a dumping ground for everything the neighbors want to get rid of. It becomes a breeding place for rats, mice, flies, and other pests; weeds grow, ripen, and the fall winds scatter seeds in every direction. The vacant lot is the sore thumb of the neighborhood, holding down the value, and increasing the upkeep of surrounding property. Experience has taught us the futility of trying to awaken enough civic pride in the soul of the vacant-lot owner to arouse him to the point of keeping his property clean and attractive. I am convinced that the best solution of the vacant-lot problem is to place a law on the statute books that will give authority to cities and towns to compel the owners to keep their property free from weeds, rubbish, or any unsightly material. The owner would then either keep his property in presentable condition, or he would lease it to his neighbors to be put to practical use as a garden, a supervised playground for the neighborhood children, a parking lot, or some other useful purpose, with the understanding that the lessee keep the premises at all times attractive. If the lot cannot be put to practical use, all accumulated rubbish should be removed and shrubs or tall flowers planted across the front parallel to the street.\nTHE good housekeeper is ready to receive and entertain visitors at any time, her house is always clean and in order. Only by following her example will our towns and cities be made attractive and ready for company at the time we celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of the pioneers' arrival.\nWe can make our State attractive, even including the vacant lot. We can complete the fulfillment of the promise. We can make the \"desert blossom as the rose,\" by adopting the same co-operation that was preached and practiced by our pioneers.\nWe all have a share in the beauty, We all have a part in the plan, What does it matter what duty Falls to the lot of man? Someone has blended the plaster, And someone has carried the stone; Neither the man nor the master, Ever has builded alone. Making a roof for the weather, Or building a house for the King, Only by working together Have men accomplished a thing. Author Unknown"

General U. S. Grant, a great military hero of the late civil war, and ex-President of the United States died at Mount MacGregor, on the morning of the 23rd of July last... The General died surrounded by his loved ones, and in the full enjoyment of the greatness he had himself achieved. He had the unusual honor of being twice elected to the highest position in the gift of the people of this nation.... Memorial services in his honor will be held in all parts of the United States. The Fair Silk Department: Here were worms eating away their green leaves, some spinning, fresh cocoons from this year; seven pounds of silk, some reeled, some spun and colored... Six different kinds of silk cloth... One lovely piece of changeable crimson and blue dress goods... Thirteen yards of purple and white, twelve yards of pink and white. All of the above is entirely Christena and Eliza Forsgren's own work, from the green mulberry leaf to the last stitch in making it up. Miscellaneous: Live near to God, and so all things will appear to you little in comparison with eternal realities. Good temper, like a sunny day, sheds a brightness over everything. It is the sweetener of toil and the soother of disquietude. ASPIRATIONS OF THE SOUL Teach me to know the mystic art Of drawing near to Thee! Teach me to know eternal life. By being one with Thee! Savior, I bring my soul to Thee, Disrobed from things of time; Teach me but with Thine holy touch And seal me ever Thine.  Hannah T. King Editorial Notes: The circular of the Brigham Young Academy... Has been received, and glancing through it we find everything is taught there that is desirable for the young people to learn. Arts and sciences, music, and needlework are included. There is also a Theological Department conducted with the utmost care.... Professor Karl G. Maeser is principal of the institution. He has had a long and wide experience as a teacher and is profoundly thoughtful as well as educationally proficient on all subjects mental, moral and spiritual. Note: The first women's hospital in China has been opened at Shanghai. It is called the Margaret Wilson Memorial Hospital. Editorial: If we cannot acknowledge the hand of an all-wise Parent in the discoveries of science today, I fear that darkness will overwhelm us again; and if it does it will be because of our stupidity in not acknowledging the hand of God in all things.... I would advise those who wish to treat the subject indifferently, to read the thirteenth chapter of St. Matthew, beginning at the thirty-eighth verse, and reflect. Page 468"

To date, only seven Spanish-American countries have given women suffrage. Miss Katherine Lenroot, former head of the Children's Bureau at Washington, National Congresswoman Edith N. Rogers, and Senora Castillo Ledon of Mexico worked on a women's and children's charter. A resolution was passed that women should henceforth be represented at all international conferences. The Inter-American Commission of Women is now an integral part of the Pan-American Union. AT the Chapultepec Conference, Utah's Mrs. Burton W. Musser was chairman of the People's Mandate Committee, which consists of intelligent, public-spirited women of all Pan-American nations. Mrs. Musser has been an official United States delegate to two Pan-American conferences, and was a member of the delegation which flew to nearly every South and Central American country to urge ratification of the treaties. She herself was author of one treaty. She feels that the Chapultepec conference was highly successful in renewing disturbed Pan-American solidarity, in gaining greater world recognition of Sanish-American countries, and in insisting upon peace instead of force as a means of settling international disputes. MRS. GROVER S. RICH, Mrs. Emily S. Stewart, Judge Reva Beck Bosone, and Mrs. Burton W. Musser attended the San Francisco Conference. Mrs. Rich, National President of the Order of Women Legislators, was appointed chairman of all the observer organizations of the nation. The other three represented the People's Mandate Committee and other national and international organizations. Mrs. Bosone, who went to the conference heavy-hearted over world conditions, came away feeling that this co-operative effort was a real beginning toward world peace. FROM the contributions of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, Mrs. Kate B. Carter has compiled another invaluable book on early Utah life  Sayings, /ingles. Mottoes, Sermonettes oi The Pioneers.

            "content": "Gratitude Should Be Expressed Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it (Proverbs 3:27). MANY of the tools for building happiness lie so close at hand that their worth is often unrecognized. Among these tools, easy to use and free for the taking, is gratitude. Its possibilities for assuring personal contentment and spreading joy to others have perhaps not been fully discovered by any of us. Gratitude has many facets, but fundamentally it is the recognition of the good and the beautiful and thankfulness for them. \"Count your many blessings\" has been good advice since the world began. This philosophy is still a comfort and a compensation, an ideal to be cultivated, for it is still a paradox of human nature that the largeness of gratitude does not always correspond to the extent of the blessings received. Appreciation is an attribute of the generous mind and the open heart.\nWhen the spirit of thankfulness attains its full stature, it goes beyond gratefulness for that which we personally possess and gains joy from blessings which others own.\nWhatever type of gratitude may permeate our thoughts, its value is only half effective if we do not express our sense of gratefulness. Gratitude unexpressed is idle treasure. The thoughtful word of sincerity, the simple \"Thank you,\" the note of appreciation, are all answers for favors received. The alert willingness to offer service to those who have given freely of their time and substance is gratitude expressed.\nGratitude to God is the leaven of religion. Gratitude for country becomes the vital force of patriotism. Gratitude for one's heritage forms the basis for that continuity of life which expresses itself in record keeping and ordinances for the dead. Today more than ever before, we realize an abiding gratitude to that courageous ancestor of the family who first listened to the gospel and believed.\nToo often children, even sons and daughters who have attained adult status, fail to give credit to their parents for years of sacrifice and care. Too often the rush of daily life obscures the duties of gratitude. Parents, too, as they grow older and their thoughts turn inward, may be guilty of ingratitude. Through lack of forbearance and understanding, they may demand more of their children than can be given or should be expected.\nThe Lord has said (Doc. & Cov. 59:21) \"And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled save those who confess not his hand in all thing, and obey his commandments.\"?V.P.C."

            "content": "Notes TO THE FIELD\nRelief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\"RELIEF SOCIETY of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\" was voted the official name of the Society by action of the General Board of Relief Society at the Board meeting held June 27, 1945. This name replaces \"National Woman's Relief Society\" by which name the Society has been known since 1892.\nWhen Relief Society was organized in Nauvoo, Illinois, March 17, 1842, by the Prophet Joseph Smith, the name chosen was \"Female Relief Society of Nauvoo.\" Later when ward organizations were effected after the arrival of the saints in Salt Lake Valley, the designation \"of Nauvoo\" was dropped and, in 1872, by vote of the members, the word \"Female\" was also dropped from the title. \"Relief Society\" was used as the official name of the organization from that time until 1892 when the Society was incorporated for a period of fifty years under the name \"National Woman's Relief Society.\" Since Relief Society is an auxiliary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose message is to all the world, the name \"Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" is felt to be the proper one.\nStake Planning Meeting Recommended During September\nTHE General Board, with the approval of the General Authorities, again recommends that a stake planning meeting be held during the month of September, preliminary to the beginning of regular weekly meetings in October, for all stake board members, ward officers, and class leaders. It is recommended that, wherever feasible, this meeting be arranged in connection with a stake priesthood meeting or a local board conference in order to keep transportation at a minimum. The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate all phases of Relief Society work at the beginning of the 1945-46 season, to preview lesson work and other activities planned for the coming year, and to give whatever instructions and help are deemed necessary by the stake board. Stake Relief Society presidents will please acquaint their respective stake presidents with the recommendation that special meeting be held, and arrange with them as to the\nmost favorable time for calling the meeting. Stake Relief Society presidents are requested to send complete details of this meeting to all ward presidents as soon as possible so that good ward representation may be assured. The General Board feels sure that stake board members will make every effort to take full advantage of this special meeting, and that they will be well prepared to conduct their respective departments for ward workers at this meeting.\nRed Cross Classes in Nutrition Now Available\nTHE American Red Cross is now offering throughout seven Western and Pacific States; namely, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, California, Oregon, and Washington, courses in nutrition designed to aid homemakers with the problem of substitute foods for rationed items and also with the proper preservation of food and food values. These courses are particularly valuable at the present time because of food restrictions and the possibility of future food shortages.\nTwo courses are available?one is a twelve-hour course; the other is a twenty-hour course. Classes are conducted once a week or at more frequent intervals according to the desires of those participating in the activity.\nRelief Society groups wishing to take advantage of these courses are advised to get in touch with the nutrition chairman of the Red Cross in their local communities. Instructors will be provided free of charge and the necessary equipment will be supplied by the Red Cross.\nRelief Society War Bonds to Be Deposited with General Board\nDURING 1944, the General Board arranged for the pooling and safekeeping of war bonds purchased by Relief Society, so that none would be lost track of during the reorganizations of Societies which end of 1944, many bonds had been deposited with the General Board for safekeeping only, however, many Societies have not taken advantage of this service.\nAll stake and ward Relief Societies whose bonds have not been posted are urged to take advantage of the free safekeeping service offered by the General Board. No charge will be made for this service. Bonds mailed to the General Board for safekeeping be sent by registered mail. A receipt will be issued for each bond received, showing the name of the stake or ward Relief Society to which it was issued, the date of issue, the series, the bond serial number, the face value of the bond, and date of maturity. As the bonds mature, they will be returned by registered mail (Continued on page 477)"

            "content": "And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER III Synopsis Delsa Marriott, trying to hide from her family and friends the fact that her fiance, Hugh Temple, serving in Australia, wants to break off their engagement, becomes interested in helping Jeff Holden, widower principal of the two-room school where Delsa teaches, take care of his motherless children. THE extra work at Jeffs every morning and afternoon crowded the days for Delsa so full that she had little time to think of Hugh and of what he wanted to do to her life. \"I won't release him yet/' she told herself. \"I owe it to us both to think this out clearly before I let go. If I decide that I cannot live without Hugh?and oh, how can I? ?and I hold on, maybe he will see that this is his life, right here in our own home town with our own home folks?the way we have always planned it. Maybe he will write again and tell me it was all a bad dream?a dream born of loneliness and distance and lost hope.\" So Delsa wasn't counting the days; she was just living and doing; picking up each task as it presented itself, laying it down when it was done. She was surprised, therefore, one afternoon to meet Millie Lewis on her way home from school?Millie Lewis with shining eyes and the breath of excitement about her. \"Delsa,\" Millie cried, \"it's club tonight. Have you forgotten?\" Delsa stopped. She was on her way to Jeff's to take care of Trudy as she had been doing each day after school. And she had forgotten that tonight was club night. She smiled, excusing her forgetful ness. \"I guess it did slip my mind, Millie,\" she said. \"Where do we meet?\" Millie looked at her in frank astonishment. \"Why, at your place silly!\" she cried. \"You don't mean you really forgot that, do you?\" Delsa nodded, embarrassed. \"I've been extra busy this past week,\" she defended herself. The bright, eager look died in Millie's eyes and something cold and shadowy looked out at Delsa. \"So I've noticed.\" she said shortly. \"What do you mean, Millie?\" Delsa asked. Millie stood there for a moment, silent, and then she raised her eyes and looked frankly at her friend. \"Don't you think you're spending a good deal of time at Jeff Holden's?\" she asked. Then she went on quickly, before Delsa could answer, \"Oh, I know he needs help?who doesn't? But Hugh's mother doesn't like it?she's been saying things, Delsa. Why don't you let those older women step in and help Jeff out? They Page  can take on an extra job as well as you can, and no one would talk.\" \"They didn't take it on, Millie,? Delsa said slowly. \"Little Trudy was half sick.\" SHE stood looking at the road for a moment and then she said, I?ve been working with Jeff all winter?in the same building with him all day. No one ever said anything?\" \"Of course not! But they might have, if you hadn't been so very, very proper all the time. But now to add an extra hour every morning and every afternoon?and right in his house, too?\" Delsa sighed. \"People make me sick!\" she said. \"Let's forget it, Millie. That wasn't what made you come running down the road to meet me?as if you had wings on your feet!\" Millie laughed. \"No it wasn't. Listen, Delsa! Jim's home! He got in on the afternoon bus? has a whole month's leave. He's going to marry Lina, Monday?and spend his honeymoon right here at home. Says there's no place he'd rather spend it!\" She paused to draw her breath. \"Oh, Millie, how happy your folks must be! How does Jim look? Is he well? And how glad Lina will be, too!\" Tears came to Delsa's eyes as she thought of Jim Lewis, her playmate since childhood, back from danger, safe at home. It meant a lot to her?to the whole town? that one of the boys could come back, out of the torment of war, to be himself again. It meant that the war hadn't yet destroyed the old life utterly. \"But that isn't all, Delsa. That isn't all! Jim's brought a buddy home?Alec Windsor?to spend the whole thirty days here. Just think, Delsa?a beautiful man in uniform to dance with and talk to and look at! Oh, I'm so excited!\" Delsa laughed, then. \"You, excited, Millie over a strange man? And with that diamond on your finger?and your heart snugly tucked under a certain ensign's jacket?\" \"Yes, I am excited, Delsa Marriott, and I'll bet a dime you are, too. How can the boys blame us? If what the papers and pictures and stories say is true, the boys get excited when they see a girl after they've been in the jungles for months!\" DELSA waved \"her hand, indicating the bare fields about her, now showing the black earth through the snow which was fast melting under the spring sunshine. \"This isn't exactly a jungle, Millie,\" she said. \"But t see your point. And what is this Alec Windsor like?\" \"He's like Hugh Temple, Delsa,\" Millie said quietly. \"It really gave me quite a start when Jim brought him in?the same long, thin darkness that Hugh has?the same intent brown eyes. Oh, Miss Delsa,\" she mocked, \"you'll be excited too, when you. See him, but it won't do you any good? nor any of us. He's spoken for.\" The mention of Hugh's name had caused Delsa's heart to jerk, feeling a hurt, empty place at its core. But she assured a gusty she couldn't feel as she asked, \"And by whom, please tell me?\"\n\"I don't know who she is, Delsa. It's quite sad, in a way. Alec got leave to come to the U. S. to marry his sweetheart. She's a WAC. But when he and Jim got to San Francisco, his WAC had been shipped out?he doesn't even know where. So he had no place to go and nothing to do. He was all for going right back to the South Pacific, but Jim persuaded him to come on here and take the rest he needed. Gosh, if it weren't for Louis I'd certainly undertake to comfort him, poor guy!\"\nDelsa smiled at her chum. \"We'll all undertake to cheer him up,\" she promised. \"There's safety in numbers?for him as well as for us?so we can do a good job of it, without any of us running into danger.\"\n\"And guess what?\" Millie went on irelandly. \"I told Jim to bring him to club tonight, when he came to pick Lina up. Then I'll introduce him to the crowd. Won't that be a honey of a surprise?\"\n\"O-oh?\" Delsa exclaimed. \"The club! I'll have to dash, Millie, if I get Trudy cared for and get home in time to get anything ready. And I must. I don't want the girls to know I forgot?\"\nShe gave Millie a quick hug and hurried on down the street, Millie calling after her, \"Your Mother and Aunt Martha are getting things ready. I came past there.\"\nDelsa hurried on.\nOf course her mother and Aunt Martha would be getting things ready. They always helped her when it was her turn to entertain the War Widows.\nDELSA smiled to herself, thinking of their club name. Of course they were none of them widows?they were none of them even married. But they had felt so bereft when the boys all left that they had taken this somber name for their little group that met every few weeks to work on things for the homes they would have \"some day.\" The truly married women had a club of their own and they met to comfort each other and to make baby things. Lina, Delsa thought suddenly, Lina would soon join that other club?the fist one of her crowd to break away.\nShe looked about her quickly, critically, as she entered Jeff's house, and she smiled with satisfaction. Mrs. Reeder wasn't half bad when she knew someone was watching her. She was really doing a creditable job now, caring for Trudy and Davy and cooking the foods Delsa told her to cook. The house was neat and clean, and the Trudy, laughing and happy, didn't look much like the dirty, crying child Delsa had found there only a week before.\nThe baby saw Delsa and laughed holding up her arms to the girl. Delsa picked her up and cuddled her for a moment, and then set to work checking what had been done and what was to be done.\n\"I can't stay to bathe Trudy tonight, Mrs. Reeder,\" she explained. \"I have company coming this evening and I've got to rush on home. But you know how to do it.\" Davy came running into the house and flung his arms about Delsa's knees. She stooped and hugged him, and said, \"You be a good boy, Davy, and mind Mrs. Reeder. Delsa's got to hurry home tonight.\" BUT in spite of her haste, the March twilight was falling before she could get away, and as she went swiftly up the walk to the house she could see, through the lighted windows, her mother and Hugh's mother, moving about the rooms. She opened the kitchen door and went into the big room, feeling the warmth from the stove upon her cool cheeks, smelling the fragrance of the cooking supper, feeling happy that this was her home. These good feelings made her forget her slight embarrassment at being late and at forgetting about the party. But she had no sooner closed the door behind her than she remembered and her happiness shriveled up. For her mother, busy at the stove, did not greet her with her usual cheerful, \"Hello, Delsa!\" and Hugh's mother's silence was like a cold wind across her. She tried to shake it off. \"Hello, folks!\" she cried gaily, and went and put her arms about her mother, giving her a squeeze. \"You're a darling to get things ready. Mom. I hurried?\" There was no answer, no yielding in the stiffness with which her mother's body answered her caress. Delsa turned to Hugh's mother, trying to ignore the rebuff. \"How are you. Aunt Martha?\" She couldn't for the life of her, make her voice sound light and casual. When Hugh's mother didn't answer, going about her work with stiff-lipped silence, Delsa turned to them and said quietly, \"You are both angry with me. Why?\" \"I guess you have a hint,\" her mother said and Delsa felt almost like smiling, noticing how her mother couldn't bear to maintain the angry silence between them. \"I know I shouldn't have forgotten the club meeting,\" Delsa said contritely, She thought, I can't stand it to have them angry. Then, determined to ignore their disapproval she went on, knowing her news would distract them, \"Jim Lewis is home?but it's supposed to be a secret till tonight. Millie's going to have him call for Lina ? and guess what! He's brought his buddy home with him!\" That caught their attention, and with the slight encouragement of lifted eyebrows and stopped movements, Delsa told about Alec Windsor and how he had come to return home with Jim, and of Jim's plans to get married. Hugh's mother sniffed audibly at this. \"Jim's smart to grab Lina while he can,\" she said, \"not that Lina ever would look at any one else. She's a mighty loyal little soul, is Lina.\" Delsa knew what Hugh's mother meant?she wondered, shall I drag her suspicions out into the open? Shall I try to clear them up? Or will that only confirm them? Deciding on ignoring the silent accusations, she went briskly about eating her supper, clearing up and preparing for the club.\nBut she was acutely aware that Hugh's mother was displeased with her?that something dear and intimate had gone out of their relationship, and she thought bitterly how easy it was for distrust to tear down in one week what years of love and trust had built up.\nAnd she thought determinedly, I won't stop helping Jeff! That's silly?that would be admitting to myself that they are right. But I will do something, something to show them that a small, neighborly gesture doesn't mean anything. I'll have to do something?but it won't be leaving Trudy and Davy to the mercy of Mrs. Reeder's unsupervised laziness.\nAnd the thought of Trudy brought the thought of Hugh and the aching knowledge that giving him up would mean giving up the hope of some day holding his baby and hers against her heart.\n(To be continued) Notes to the Field (Continued from page 472)\nto the respective Relief Societies which own them. A Relief Society wishing to call a bond before maturity may procure its bond at any time upon request, accompanied by the receipt of deposit issued by this office.\nBulletin 24 issued February 19, 1942, to all stake, ward, and mission Relief Society presidents, pointed out, on page 13, that Series E bonds are for issue only to individuals, that any bonds purchased from Relief Society funds should be either of series F or G, and should be in the name of the Society. Not the name of an individual."

Annual Report?1944 Vera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer 1940-1945 \nRELIEF Society activities were carried forward during 1944 very much as in 1943, and the outstanding accomplishments were in the same fields; namely (1) sewing service including an extensive assignment for the Church Welfare Plan; (2) continuation of special war services; (3) a further substantial increase insubscriptions; and (4) continuation of the Society's educational program with a slight but heartening increase in attendance despite wartime restrictions and conditions.\nThese and other services and activities were carried forward by Relief Society women with their characteristic devotion, efficiency, and humility, despite their intense anxiety over the absence of sons and daughters and other loved ones due to the exigencies of war, despite the increased demands on their own time because of labor shortages in their homes and communities, and despite the great grief of the loss of gallant young sons.\nTo all these, the sisterhood of Relief Society has been an anchor and a blessing, a source of sympathetic understanding and deep spiritual support, a means of easing anxiety and sorrow in the blessed-ness of serving others, of gaining uplift and hope for the future, and of strengthening their faith in the divine plan of eternal life and progression.\nThe growth in Relief Magazine subscriptions was reported in detail in the issue for May 1945, pages 292 to 313, indicating that the exceptional gains resulting from the special effort of 1943 were not only maintained but further increased during 1944 by nearly 5,000 additional subscriptions. Attention is also directed to \"Notes From the Field\" appearing monthly in the Magazine and recounting various Relief Society activities as reported by stakes, missions, and local Relief Societies. These continuing reports serve to high light and delineate Relief Society activities which, in an annual report, can be treated only in summary. Pertinent figures from the 1944 report are compared with those of 1943 in summary tables appearing on pages 494-495.\nRELIEF SOCIETY SEWING SERVICE\nSewing service at Relief Society work meetings in 1944 was the most extensive yet reported, aggregating a total of 716,760 hours' service and 254,004 units completed. Classified according to kinds, the 254,004 completed articles consisted of 14,019 quilts, 21,866 pieces of other bedding, 39,725 articles of children's clothing, 18,578 articles of women's clothing, 12,195 pieces of men's\nclothing, and 147,650 miscellaneous items such as dish towels, rugs, and other unclassified articles.\nHowever, the number of women doing this increased sewing declined slightly from 1943 to 32,676. It therefore seems advisable to repeat the following exhortation from the 1944 Annual Report: \"... this group of sewing women represents less than one-third of the total membership of the Society, and it would seem that a larger percentage might be brought into the sewing program, even though some of the members are unavailable for this service because of war work or other employment. Suggestions for emphasizing and extending the Society's sewing program throughout the Church, and for enlisting the interest and participation of more women in the work meeting through promotion of sewing skills, appear on pages 378-389, this issue [July 1944] of the Magazine.\"\nSewing for Red Cross\nApproximately one-fourth of the women sewing at Relief Society work meetings during 1944 worked on articles for the Red Cross. These women, numbering 7,874, gave 193,338 hours and completed 103,744 articles. Although fewer hours of service were given, the articles completed were more than double the number reported in 1943, indicating the making of a greater number of small articles requiring less time than articles previously assigned by the Red Cross.\nSewing for Church Welfare\nThe next largest number of articles was completed for the Church Welfare Plan and totaled 83,414 pieces. This is more than three times the number of articles completed for the Church Welfare Plan in 1943, but in that year the assignment consisted principally of quilts, whereas the 1944 assignment consisted principally of clothing for men, women and children and supplementary bedding and household supplies such as sheets, pillowcases and dish towels. There is no segregated record of the amount of time spent at Relief Society meetings on Church Welfare sewing.\nMany stakes held impressive displays of the sewing accomplished for the Church Welfare Plan during 1944. (See \"Notes From the Field,\" June 1945.) As in 1943, the General Board authorized the purchase of materials for this assignment from funds of the Society, and disbursements for this purpose doubtless accounted largely for the increase of $4,268.19, or 30 per cent over 1943 disbursements. Permission to use Relief Society funds for this purpose was not continued beyond 1944, when collection of funds by Relief Society visiting teachers was discontinued and when the General Board and the General Church Welfare Committee agreed to rely on the provision of the Church Welfare Plan which charges regional or stake welfare committees with responsibility for financing assignments which they receive. The following comments from a few stakes reflect the spirit with which Relief Society women accepted this assignment and the pride which they took in its fulfillment: From Rexburg Stake (Idaho): This assignment was almost equally divided among the fifteen wards and at a special meeting was given to the ward presidents for acceptance. It was with a great deal of trepidation that the assignments were given to the wards, but not a single word of protest was made. Each president accepted her list and went home to work out ways and means of fulfilling it. Cotton goods of any kind and white materials especially were almost off the market, but this did not daunt the sisters. With a will that finds a way, the assignments were completed before the close of the year?many of them, before six months had passed. Some of the wards used their charity or their general funds, or part of both, for the purchase of materials. Others gathered donations from the teachers' districts. For example, a certain district would be assigned the twenty-one dish towels, and the teachers on that district would either collect the goods or their equivalent in money. Most of the layettes were gathered at a baby shower at one of the work meetings. At the meeting beforehand, slips of paper with the names of articles required were drawn by the sisters, and on the day of the shower, they came with the article nicely wrapped. The occasion was made into a lovely party, with refreshments, programs, and games, after which the layette was displayed by the presidency. One ward made most of their assignment from poultry feed bags, which they collected from the poultry men in their area, washed and bleached and then made into slips and panties, pillowcases and dish towels. Some of the bags were dyed in pastel colors and made into dainty slips for the children. When completed, the assignments were pressed and beautifully packed and turned into the welfare center. Not a single article from any ward was lacking. We feel that neither mere words nor cold figures can tell the sacrifice, loyalty and devotion which the sisters put into the achievement of this huge task. Many of them bought their limit or two sheets, giving them to the Society and doing without themselves. Hours of sewing in the homes were required for the completion of this project. But we are sure that every Relief Society woman in the stake is gratified with her accomplishment. From Phoenix Stake (Arizona): During January 1944, representatives from each ward met and cut all the articles for our welfare sewing; 50 hours of cutting was done. The articles were then distributed to the wards for sewing. Our 1944 assignments were completed early in the year. From Cottonwood Stake (Utah): The women of the eight wards met the requirements of the welfare assignment in the most co-operative spirit, finishing the entire assignment long before it was due. Great pride was taken in making the layettes, fine handwork making them very dainty and attractive. Every organization displayed in its oven ward the finished articles before sending them to the regional storehouse. From San Francisco Stake (California): The stake and ward Relief Societies exhibited their welfare sewing in the amusement hall at the October stake conference. This exhibit consisted of ten large tables laden with handmade quilts, clothing, et cetera. This display helped to stimulate interest in welfare work and an appreciation for the industry of the Relief Society women. The following comment from Uintah Stake is a reminder of the timeliness of the bedding project recommended by the Church Welfare Committee and the General Board of Relief Society in 1941 and 1942 for the purpose of encouraging and assisting families to restock their bedding supplies: From Uintah Stake (Utah): - During 1944 our bedding project was still being carried forward in some wards with interest and beneficial results. One ward with an enrollment of forty-one members ANNUAL REPORT 481 completed forty-three quilts, almost an average of four quilts for each work day of the year. At the close of this year we all know that materials for quilt making are practically off the market. The president of this ward tells us they are very thankful this bedding project was assigned for now every family in their ward is more adequately supplied with bedding than ever before, and in working out the project they have had very happy times together, have increased the average attendance at meetings, and have grown spiritually. Other wards have also done splendid work in the line of bedding. Sewing for Other Purposes Articles made for Relief Society purposes, usually to replenish the Societies treasuries through bazaars and custom sewing, chiefly quilting, also increased over 1943 and amounted to 54,434 articles. In addition, 116,171 articles were made for other purposes, such as sewing for hospitals and other worthy community purposes, but a slight decrease of nearly 7,000 articles was recorded in this section during the year, doubtless due to decreased need for this service from community agencies. Here are some additional comments which relate to other Relief Society sewing activities and to the efforts made to increase participation in Relief Society work meetings with a view to teaching and benefiting the members themselves with their home sewing as well as to give sewing service for others: From Uintah Stake (Utah): Also on work days we sponsored a project of made-over clothing. To make this more interesting and beneficial some of our ward leaders participated in a three-day school conducted by an extension specialist from the Agricultural College. These leaders then demonstrated in die different wards the work they had received, and soon many little girls were thrilled with a new skirt made from daddy's old coat, or a slip or even a dress made from his old shirt. To finish off this project we had a display of \"made-overs\" at our stake conference in November. From Rexburg Stake (Idaho): Our board added four women's and four men's suits to our baptismal clothing cupboard; also some towels and a heavy rug. This project has proved a great blessing to the children and adults who come to the Tabernacle for baptism. A member of the board is in attendance each month. A small fee is charged for the use of the clothing?enough to pay for the laundry. Our aim is to supply enough clothing someday to have every one wearing uniform outfits. From Phoenix Stake (Arizona): Thirty-two baptismal suits were cut and made and donated to the Arizona Temple. From Pasadena Stake (California): A project on which our Relief Societies are really putting forth some excellent effort is the remodeling of used clothing. We are obtaining old clothes which are in good condition and making the hard-to-get children's clothing, and the materials are far superior to any new ones which can be purchased at this time. From Ogden Stake (Utah): The wards seem much enthused over the new procedure on work day, and we are happy to note a general pickup, and that the attendance is improving. From Snowflake Stake (Arizona): Several bazaars were held during the year. One ward working for a new rug for their room put pep into their work by choosing sides. Each group was given $20 to buy material with; the bazaar netted them over $300. From Highland Stake (Utah): At a planning meeting on September 19, we presented a display of new and remodeled clothing and other articles in an effort to stimulate an interest among the ward workers in introducing similar activities into their work meetings. One of the wards held a successful apron sale and one helped with a ward fair. In several of the wards cooking demonstrations have been held on their work days. A fairly large amount of quilting has been done in most of the wards. We feel that the new work-day program has been carried out very successfully in our stake. OTHER CHURCH WELFARE SERVICE In addition to sewing at Relief Society meetings on articles to be turned in to bishops' storehouses, Relief Society women have done sewing at some of the storehouses, have assisted at storehouses with the canning of a tremendous amount of fruits and vegetables, and have stimulated interest and activity in their various communities in increased canning for home use in order to conserve food supplies and to relieve commercial supplies for war use. Although reports of the number of hours given by Relief Society women on Church Welfare projects (other than sewing at Relief Society meetings) are still incomplete, a total of 524,915 hours' service by Relief Society women on such projects was reported last year, almost double the number of hours reported the previous year, an increase of 237,105 hours, or eighty-two per cent. Only a small fraction (five per cent) of this service is given by women whose families are being aided by the bishops, ninety-five per cent of this service being given by women whose families were not being assisted. In fact, the hours' service by women whose families were receiving aid from the storehouses decreased during 1944 by twenty-five per cent while service by other Relief Society women increased ninety-six per cent. Of this storehouse service and other activities in the interest of the Church Welfare Plan, a few stakes and one mission reported as follows: From San Diego Stake (California): Our women have spent many hours at the canning plant as well as at the sewing center. A laundry room has been built very recently and the board, with the ward organizations, donated equal amounts earned from the sale of used clothing and equipped it with a fifty-gallon tank and laundry tubs. From the Canadian Mission (Canada): The sisters in several of our larger branches have assisted in canning about 2,000 cans of fruits and vegetables, and are at present working on welfare assignments?making quilts, layettes and maternity bundle\" for use in their own organizations, and, of course, preparing more \"Bundles for Britain.\" From Uintah Stake (Utah): In all wards, classes sponsored by Relief Society were held by the home demonstration agent for instruction in pressure cooking testing. Many cookers were tested during these demonstrations. Instructions were also given on drying of vegetables and fruits and sulphuring of fruits. Three classes of Relief Society women were also given instruction in home gardening. From Cottonwood Stake (Utah): Early in the summer all of the women possessing pressure cookers were given the opportunity to test them. ANNUAL REPORT 483 Although no accurate count was taken of the amount of canning done, we feel sure that enough fruits, vegetables, and meats have been canned to top any previous year. From North Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho): We have co-operated with the county home demonstrator of the Department of Agriculture in the testing of pressure cookers, meal preparation, growing of vegetable gardens, and demonstration in canning, bread making, use of patterns, et cetera. All these were done with the hope of making our Relief Society members more efficient in these war times. From Snowflake Stake (Arizona): Another activity that has interested our women resulted from our aim to get a first-class recipe for canning our most productive Arizona crop?pinto beans. The stake welfare launched the project throughout the Relief Society. The results brought sixteen samples of canned or bottled beans, from which first and second choices will be made. From Mount Ogden Stake (Utah): The canning for the storehouse was participated in by each ward as the season's produce came in. CONTINUED WAR SERVICES Relief Society women continued their wholehearted support of wartime agencies during 1944, as more extensively described in annual reports for 1942 and 1943, and in \"Notes From the Field\" for October and November 1943, and August, October, and November 1944. In addition to sewing for the Red Cross, already discussed, Relief Society women have served extensively at Red Cross sewing and bandage-rolling centers, but time spent for this purpose is not included in the count of hours devoted to Red Cross work at Relief Society meetings. The ward first-aid kits, first recommended by the General Board in 1942, were still being maintained by ward Relief Societies at the end of 1944, in the number of 780 kits, and, in addition, 529 home-nursing supply chests were being maintained; 544 wards were also keeping current lists of nurses available in the community as had been recommended by the General Board. The value of these kits to a community in case of accident or disaster was demonstrated March 14, 1945, when twelve men were badly burned in a Kenilworth mine explosion. This ward, in Carbon Stake (Utah) reported: \"Of greatest value were the ten woolen quilts and the two woolen blankets. Most of the men, wearing nothing but charred bits of clothing, needed warm covering immediately. The bedding was lifted from the chest standing in the entrance way of the hospital, the quilts doubled and placed over the sufferers as they lay about waiting further medical aid. Later, several of the quilts protected the men in ambulances speeding to Price. Medical attendants expressed gratitude for the quick availability of these coverings whose warmth helped to stave off shock. Because a mine hospital is well stocked with emergency materials, other supplies were untouched. However, the nurse said, \"Just one more man and everything would have been used,\" adding, \"it is a lesson to all Relief Societies that there is a definite purpose in having these kits in every ward.\" A member of the Society remarked, \"I thought after the war we might sell those quilts, but now I see their use extends beyond a wartime precaution.\" Narrative reports from some of the stakes refer to their war service as follows: From Phoenix Stake (Arizona): On the fourth Monday of each month our ward Relief Societies have taken turns serving at the U. S. O. They furnish and prepare the food. Sandwiches, cakes, pies, and homemade cookies seem to please the boys most. On Christmas day the Second Ward officers served over 400 boys. They felt a great satisfaction in making Christmas more pleasant for servicemen. From San Diego Stake (California): Our members have spent many hours at the Red Cross, donated blood, kept children that others might work, opened their homes to out-of-town servicemen, fed and cheered them, mothered them and sent them on their way wih a prayer in their hearts for their safe return. Our Latter-day Saint women are more than anxious to do all they can to assist the war effort. From South Los Angeles Stake (California): At the beginning of this year we were aware that our mothers were anxious to help, as an organization, the work of the Red Cross. We, therefore, arranged with our local chapter to become a separate unit, The Sea Gull Unit, and during the year our sisters have completed 1,216 articles of clothing and spent 3,990 hours working to help this splendid organization to help their boys and girls who are a part of our armed forces. From Mount Ogden Stake (Utah): The Red Cross has received extensive aid, as will be noted through reports. The canteen has received several hundred dozens of cookies, as well as many women giving service there. The surgical dressing department of Red Cross received many hours' assistance from Relief Society women. From South Ogden Stake (Utah): Six of our wards furnished 495 dozen cookies for the Red Cross canteen during the year. From North Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho): Our first counselor acted as chairman of the Red Cross activities. She arranged with the county Red Cross officials for regular working hours for the wards and nearly all of our Societies have helped to fill the county quotas. From Canadian Mission (Canada): We have sent about 300 pounds of clothing, soap, safety pins, et cetera, to the Relief Society in Britain for distribution there. We recently received a letter from the Relief Society officers of the British Mission, in which they tell us that some of our clothing has been sent on to France to help relieve conditions there. This was made possible through the help of one of our officers who, although he is in the battle area, finds time to do this work of mercy for the children who suffer there. Some of our branches have done exceptional work. A recent bundle came in from the Hamilton Branch in which were many children's sweaters made from ends of new material purchased from a knitwear factory by one of the employees who is an enthusiastic Relief Society worker. These ends were made into lovely sweaters, suits, garter waists, and even underclothes. It was a beautiful bundle. The letter from Britain tells of the need \"over there\" for children's clothing, ages one to fourteen, and clothing for elderly people, also bedding. We have promised to help as long as there is need. During 1944, stake and ward Relief Societies purchased additional war bonds in the amount of $37,889.46. Purchases for the two previous years amounted to $44,623.08 bringing the total by the end of 1944 to $82,492.54. During 1944, the General Board arranged for the pooling and safekeeping of these bonds, so that none would be lost track of during the reorganizations which will occur prior to maturity. By the end of 1944, bonds to the value of $41,335.00 had been deposited with the General Board. All stakes and war Relief Societies whose bonds are not so deposited are urged to take advantage of the free safekeeping service offered by the General Board.\nMEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE\nRelief Society meetings of all types during 1944 numbered 89,629, an increase of 7,317 or 9.58 per cent from the previous year. All types of stake and ward meetings shared in this increase but local meetings for members claimed sixty-four per cent of these additional gatherings. Further analysis indicates that 77.91 per cent of the increase in meetings for members occurred in mission branches which conducted 5,585 more meetings in 1944 than in 1943, whereas wards conducted 1,670 more meetings. These several meetings with extent of increase are listed in the table on page 494.\nTraining-Report Meetings and Ward Preparation Meetings\nIt is heartening to note that a slight increase of 3.42, or four per cent, also occurred in the number of visiting teachers' training meetings, and that an even more substantial increase was felt in number of ward preparation meetings which advanced from 7,018 in 1943 to 8,515 in 1944, an increase of 497 or 7.08 per cent. The increases in these two types of meetings were doubtless due to the emphasis placed on them by the General Board to help bulletins to officers, through the pages of the Magazine, and through the discussion meetings conducted by representatives of the General Board during the latter part of 1943 and 1944.\nThe combination of the training and the report meetings for visiting teachers (recommended in the Magazine for September 1944), and the stress laid on the purpose and importance of this meeting, doubtless stimulated this increase which it is hoped will be even more evident as the new plan is carried through 1945. The increase in the vitally important ward preparation meeting for officers and class leaders was further stimulated by a detailed outline of procedure which was published in the Magazine for September 1944. Nevertheless, the number of such ward preparation meetings should nearly double in order to represent a monthly meeting of this kind for all local Relief Societies during the eightmonth period, September through April, and during the summer period as required. In furthering these two types of meetings and also in held demonstrations during 1944 which were attended by local officers. Here is what three stakes have to say regarding the ward preparation meeting: From Phoenix Stake (Arizona): At the opening of the fall season each board member was assigned a certain ward to visit once a month (preferably ward preparation meeting) and to bring to the board problems and accomplishments of this particular ward. At the next board meeting these problems are discussed and any suggestions from the entire board are then taken back to the ward. We feel that follow-up visits by the same board member will result in more helpful suggestions. From Highland Stake (Utah): We have worked hard during the past year to get all of our wards to hold regular monthly preparation meetings, as we are fully convinced that such meetings present an opportunity to the ward workers to become more familiar with the Relief Society program, and with the problems and interests of their individual organizations. At the beginning of the 1944-45 season, we, as a stake presidency, visited the monthly preparation meetings of each ward to see how they were conducted and to attempt to stimulate more interest in such meetings. All of our wards realize the necessity of getting their officers and workers together in such meetings and they are now being held regularly. We feel that the visiting teachers' training report meeting and the method of making reports have been more successful and more interesting than the former procedure. From Uintah Stake (Utah): Another thing we think is resulting in good to our wards was a demonstration, at union meeting, of an executive officers' meeting, and of a ward preparation meeting. Ward Conferences An increase was also recorded in the number of annual ward Relief Society conferences held, but the Sunday evening meeting in March, also for the ward membership in general, may have been included erroneously in some instances. A substantial increase of twenty-one per cent was noted in the number of officers' meetings held in connection with the annual ward Relief Society conference, the number increasing from 1184 in 1943 to 1424 in 1944. South Ogden Stake(Utah) comments on these meetings as follows: We succeeded in holding preliminary officers' meetings before each of our ward Relief Society conference sessions. A questionnaire was presented by the visiting board member, at each preliminary meeting, checking on each department of ward work. In connection with the ward conferences, we wish to report that our stake presidency was very considerate of us, appointing high councilmen to attend both the preliminary officers' meeting and the general session in each of the wards, as well as furnishing transportation to the outlying wards. We feel deeply appreciative for this courtesy, and we know that it added much to the success of our conference to have one of the stake presidency or one of our high councilmen in each of our conferences.\" Increased Attendance of Members A small but encouraging increase in attendance at Relief Society meetings was noted during 1944. On the average, there were 475 more women in the weekly meetings than in 1943, bringing average attendance to 29,171, representing 28.6 per cent of Relief Society members. The downward trend of the two preceding years, directly due to war conditions, has been greatly slackened in some areas and entirely blocked in others. Nevertheless, efforts to improve attendance records should not be relaxed as ANNUAL REPORT attendance at local Relief Societies in stakes actually declined from 1943, whereas better attendance at local Relief Societies in missions accounted for the general increase. This is doubtless due in part to population shifts from home wards in stakes to temporary locations near war plants and military centers located within mission boundaries. War conditions, including employment of women, are still reflected in Relief Society attendance records. For example, Rexburg Stake (Idaho) reports: ? More and more of our women are working in the seed houses, stores, and in the fields. Snowflake Stake (Arizona) reported the following efforts to increase attendance: Three wards started nurseries during Relief Society to care for young children. Three wards had contests in attendance and preparation of lessons. One of these wards put their score card where the Sunday School children could read their mothers' records. Several wards made friendly visits to delinquent members, to encourage attendance. ' The accompanying table, when compared with similar figures for previous years, indicates some shift in the popularity of the subject matter treated at the weekly meetings. AVERAGE ATTENDANCE AT LOCAL RELIEF SOCIETY MEETINGS Theology and Work Meetings: Wards in Stakes 26,463, Mission Branches 5,325, All Relief Societies 31,518. Literature Meetings: Wards in Stakes 23,269, Mission Branches 4,030, All Relief Societies 28,199. Social Science Meetings: Wards in Stakes 23,509, Mission Branches 4,732, All Relief Societies 28,241. All Meetings: Wards in Stakes 23,692, Mission Branches 4,736, All Relief Societies 28,428. Wards in Stakes 24,233, Mission Branches 4,038, All Relief Societies 29,171. The theology meeting on the first Tuesday of the month continues to lead, with an average attendance of 31,818, but the figure is slightly less than the average of 32,187 for 1943. Attendance at all other types of meetings increased over 1943. The social science meeting day, on the fourth Tuesday of the month, held second place from the standpoint of average attendance in 1944, whereas it has previously held fourth place. Average attendance at the literature meetings on the third Tuesday of the month very closely approaches that of social science. Although attendance at the work meeting indicated that it held fourth place from the standpoint of popularity during 1944, attendance on this day actually increased over 1943 and will doubtless continue to do so as the modified program recommended by the General Board and published in the Magazine for July 1944, is further developed and varied to meet the home-making interests and to utilize the talents of Relief Society members. Average attendance was lower than in 1943 at all four types of meetings held in wards, but higher in each category in the missions. \n\nCorrected OCR Transcription\nStake Meetings\nAll types of stake meetings showed increases (see table on page 494) except those held in lieu of union meetings which declined slightly, as would be expected in the face of a 64 per cent increase in number of actual union meetings held. It is also interesting to note that many stakes took advantage of the opportunity arranged for by the General Board to hold union meetings in connection with fourth-quarter stake conferences rather than to conduct an extra general session of such conferences. Although twenty-three more stakes participated in union conferences than during the preceding year, the number conducting extra general sessions declined by twenty-nine, whereas the number holding union meetings in lieu of such extra general sessions increased by fifty-two. ORGANIZATIONS AND MEMBERSHIP\nThe decline in Relief Society membership which has been in progress since the peak year of 1941 continued during 1944, but the rate of loss was much less than during the two preceding years. The net membership decrease from 1943 was 1,848 or 1.8 per cent, whereas the loss in 1943 was 3,373 or three per cent and in 1942 was 8,000 or seven per cent. The reasons for the decrease are the same as during the previous two years?unusual population shifts throughout the country occasioned by war employment and other war conditions, with the resulting lack of affiliation with the Relief Society in the new and often temporary location, and to the clearing from the rolls of names of women who joined the Society during the height of the membership campaign but proved to be not genuinely interested. Actually, there were more admittances to membership (12,730) during 1944 than in 1943 and also fewer removals and resignations, leaving the net number of members increased in 1944 at 102,961. Local Relief Societies should continue to solicit unenrolled women including new arrivals who in so far as may have been affiliated elsewhere.\nThe members are accounted for in a total of 2,217 local Relief Societies. The geographic distribution on page 493 shows the number of local Relief Societies and number of Relief Society members in each state of the United States and in other countries. These organizations and members are also listed according to whether they are located in stakes or in missions. There were 135 more ward Relief Societies in stakes in 1944 than in 1943, but nearly 2,000 fewer members. On the other hand, local Relief Societies in missions declined by twenty-four, but the number of members increased slightly (131). Another distribution of members?according to assignments in a Society?appears on page 494. As is usual, approximately half of the total membership is assigned to one or one or more capacities of the organization's elected officers, leaders, special workers or visiting teachers. ANNUAL REPORT 489 However, the number of stake officers and board members declined during 1944, doubtless as a result of curtailed activity on the part of stake workers due to war conditions. Executive and special workers in the wards increased slightly, as did the number of visiting teachers, but nearly 600 fewer class leaders were reported, as a result of the discontinuance of the home topic from the monthly work meeting, as announced in the Magazine for July 1944. Where there is a shortage of women for the various positions, one officer or class leader frequently serves in more than one capacity, but is counted only once in this distribution. From this same table it is noted that seventy per cent of all Relief Society members are Magazine subscribers? the highest proportion in the history of the Society. The percentage of subscribing officers and class leaders was about the same as in 1943, but sixty-seven per cent of the visiting teachers and other members was reported as subscribers in 1944 as compared with sixty per cent in 1943. VISITING TEACHING The continued decline in visiting teaching since the beginning of the war is again apparent from the 1944 report. Despite the fact that visiting teachers' districts were increased by 631 or four per cent, evidently in order to reduce the number of families per visiting teacher, the number of visiting teachers was increased by only 131, and the number of visits dropped by 46,368 or four per cent. Visits attempted where no one was found at home constituted 368,022 or thirty-two per cent of the total of 1,144, 519 visits made. Families were found at home in 776,497, or sixty-eight per cent of the visits attempted, a slightly better ratio than was found at home during the previous year's visits. Nevertheless, visits attempted in 1944 were actually fewer by 126,884 4% 4% 49444 immediately preceding the war. Although nearly 20,000 communications were reported by mail and telephone, in lieu of visits, contacts of this type were nearly 8,000 fewer than in 1943, or twenty-eight per cent less. This may be partly accounted for by the fact that the General Board discouraged the printing of visiting teachers' messages, some of which were doubtless mailed to unvisited families and were replaced by no other communication in lieu of a visit. The decline of nine per cent or 3,799 in average monthly number making contributions is a direct result of the change in policy, announced in the Magazine for September 1944, when collections by visiting teachers were discontinued, after being in effect for 102 years, from the Society's very first meeting. The new policy became effective in October 1944, so that the number of contributors shown in the annual report represents principally those making donations during the preceding nine months. COMPASSIONATE SERVICES Visits to the sick and homebound increased by seven per cent to 116,219 during 1944, but the number of days' care of the sick, both volunteer and paid from the Society's funds, declined by four per cent to 13,883. There was a decrease of twenty per cent in number of bodies prepared for burial, particularly with respect to those instances where complete preparation was given. This would indicate an increase in the services of morticians; on the other hand, there was a slight increase in the number of bodies dressed for burial by Relief Society women. It must be remembered, however, that many deeds of kindness, compassion, and helpfulness are performed for those in sorrow and distress which cannot be measured in terms of reports, as evidenced by the following excerpts: From South Los Angeles Stake (California): Every ward in our stake has performed its various activities cheerfully and efficiently, but there is one ward which we feel has had the spirit of service in rich abundance. The Maywood Ward sisters, under the direction of their president. Sister Irene Andrus, went in a group and painted and papered the entire house of one of their members who is confined to a wheel chair. From North Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho): The Sunshine Committee, which consists of stake board members, continued to make the weekly visits to the L. D. S. Hospital. We were especially desirous of visiting Relief Society women patients from distant towns, hoping to cheer them and to extend to them assistance when needed. From the New Zealand Mission: You will also notice under \"Burial Assistance\" there is a blank. This does not give a true picture of the situation as the Relief Society sisters are very active in their services for the dead. They have been complimented on many occasions by undertakers and hospital attendants because of the lovely manner in which they have dressed the dead. I have encouraged the sisters to see that elderly people and those whose health is failing keep on hand suitable white clothing for burial when the need arises. They have responded well to this request. Some of the Relief Societies are continuing to co-operate with local public health authorities in conducting well-baby clinics. September 1944 marked the twentieth anniversary of the Cottonwood Stake Maternity Hospital (Utah) which is operated by the Relief Society of that stake; 736 babies were born there during 1944. All together 8,595 patients have been admitted since the hospital was opened. This hospital is recognized as fulfilling all requirements of the U. S. Government for the acceptance of servicemen's wives. This stake has continuously operated a well-baby clinic since 1921. In 1944, a total of 387 children attended this clinic and all have the privilege of tree vaccination for smallpox and immunization for diphtheria and whooping cough, in addition to physical examination and consultation. Funds Expended Total disbursement of local, stake, and mission Relief Societies and the General Board during 1944 aggregated $539,155.22, an increase of ANNUAL REPORT 491 $98,552.90, or twenty-two percent over disbursements of 1943. Of this amount $110,354.57 was spent for charitable purposes and $428,800.65 for general operating expenses and the Society's educational work. The charitable disbursements represented an increase over 1943 of $18,168.69, or twenty per cent, which may be attributed chiefly to authorization by the General Board of the use of Relief Society funds for the purchase of materials for the 1944 Church Welfare clothing assignment. In addition. Relief Society funds were disbursed directly to needy families and health services were also provided in some areas. Commodities with an estimated value of $4,896.92 which had been contributed to the Relief Society were also distributed to the needy, bringing total charity disbursements to $115,251.49. Included in the disbursements for general purposes is a considerable but unidentified amount spent for improving Relief Society rooms and stake and ward buildings in general. The following few excerpts from narrative reports indicate the nature of these expenditures: From ???New Zealand Mission: Recently we have made a drive to raise money to install a community shower bath in one of the Maori Pas whose misfortune it is to be deprived of proper sanitary facilities. The response has been most gratifying. We have collected over $600 from the various Relief Society organizations for this purpose. From Uintah Stake (Utah): This year our stake board was asked, along with other organizations, to fix up the Relief Society room at the stake office. To do this we needed some money. So we accepted an invitation to prepare and serve three banquets for different groups and felt well paid for our effort when we cleared almost $500. From North Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho): During the early part of the year the stake and ward Relief Society organizations purchased a carpet for the Relief Society room in the stake tabernacle. Funds were raised by special effort with that thought in mind, in most cases. The stake board had in 1942 raised funds to enable it to attend the centennial services in Salt Lake City. Since that event was cancelled we decided to use the money in the furnishing of that room. From Nampa Stake (Idaho): On March 10, our board held a bazaar. Although only ten in number at that time, we worked hard and intensely and with help from other Church members we were very successful. Our profits were $120.15. We are working for a bazaar again this year in March. Our stake is looking forward to a stake building and we hope to have funds on hand for furnishings for our room. From San Diego Stake (California): In August 1944, the board was assigned the task of raising $1,000 for the stake building fund and we immediately went into action. We held an apron bazaar, a candy and ice cream sale, and gave a chili supper. A dinner was given later on and the balance of the fund was donated by our members. In a short time we had our quota with $55 over and were the first organization in the stake to complete this assignment. Total net assets of the Society as of the end of 1944, including cash on hand, wheat trust funds, war bonds, and other invested funds, value of real estate, buildings, furniture, and other property were reported to be $1,440,070.55.

Not to the Swift [Continued horn page 464) indians skulking in the ravine, had seen them slip down over the hill. The scouts had hopelessly watched them ride off, the old chief with Elsa's tablecloth and scalped locks streaming out behind. The men averted embarrassed eyes when she had displayed her bristling mop and intact scalp, but-the women had run, laughing, for strips of cherished velvets and silk to bind up the unsightly fringe. \"Aye; it's tooken a brae' bit o' corage oon the lassie's paert t' gi' awa heer bonny tresses,\" old Jenny McBride had chided them. \"If the auld hathen's kaipin his word we'll be slaipen' in hooses whin the cauld wind blaus.\" The old heathen had kept his word. At sunset on the second day he tore into camp, his braves tailing out behind, loaded with buffalo beef. After two days of cooking and feasting, of drying and salting down, meat, they had resumed their journey. Elsa would never forget the afternoon she looked down upon Zion. A cluster of log cabins nestled in a broad valley, turning to gold in the September sunshine. Two years slipped by. The hollows in Jim's cheeks disappeared. Firm flesh upholstered his gaunt frame. He fenced a piece of land, built a log house, made tables and chairs and a bed. He hired out and earned a wagon, two black oxen and the necessary tools and seed. One day when wild currants flamed in the canyons and choke-cherries fringed the waterways with \"summer-snow,\" she gave Jim a son. Her heart had been too small to hold its burden of joy. She had gone, thankfully, to the Bowery on the first Sunday morning and sat with her baby across her knees. She had lifted her voice again in praise, had listened to Brother Brigham, secure in her dreams. It had all seemed so right, so wonderful to be in the Valley. Then had dawned the unforgettable day that brought her dreams crashing down. Brother Brigham was speaking. His voice seemed to drift in from another world. \"The climate?suitable to cotton ?a mill site by adequate water power. Need men?skilled in growing of cotton?spinners?weavers?families who have proved their courage.\" Then, like a thunderbolt, Jim's name and hers! She had sat like one condemned, her cooing baby unnoticed in her lap. Jim came, his eyes aglow with a new purpose. Friends crowded around, some of them already bargaining their farms away. It seemed like sacrilege to her. She helped Jim pack as the weeks wore away and the harvesting began. Its abundance had furnished her scant pleasure. It mattered little whether she lived or died. She was leaving the mountains, going to a land she detested, a wilderness beyond the last outpost of civilization. When, at last, they joined the caravan at the \"Square\" on that early autumn morning, she climbed up on the wagon seat, hoping against hope that something would happen to turn them back. Men bustled about the wagons NOT TO THE SWIFT 497 packing and repacking. Oxen chewed their cuds and switched their tails with melancholy indifference. Women gathered in excited knots, restraining heedless little feet from the bedlam of activity. She sat on the high wagon seat, alone, staring at the mountains with desperate eyes. At last the command to start rang out like a pistol shot. A murmur swelled to a roar. Neckyokes creaked, oxen heaved and strained as reluctant wheels rolled into line. On and on they rumbled?past Ka-nosh, beyond Parowan and the Cove, up to Cedar Mountain and the Iron mines, over the Rim of the Basin and down, braking the wheels with logs of cedar and pine. SHE came to herself with a start. Jim was shaking her gently. She awoke into stark reality. \"We're most theyah, honey,\" Jim reassured her. \"But you'uns 'ill have to climb down while we take the wagon apart and lowah the pieces oveh the ledges with ropes.\" She lowered the yawning baby into his father's arms. \"Walk about whilst I unpack, honey,\" he urged, setting her on her feet. She found a winding trail, worn smooth by the tread of moccasined feet. It led up to a lonely knoll, fluted and carved by age-long sculpturing of wind and rain. It formed a natural lookout, commanding the sweep of a country so vast one could only guess at its magnitude. Far to the south the hazy peaks of the Parashaunts melted into the misty sky. They seemed unfriendly and remote. Even the ridges to the west, like a giant steamboat plowing through clouds of foam, seemed but a shattered pile of rocks discarded by indifferent hands. Below, yawned the barren wastes of the desert cut through by the crimson flood of the river. She turned, hopelessly, to the north and?there was her mountain, rising above the crimson knolls in solitary splendor, girdled with pines that marched to its snowy crest, dimpled with little valleys that awakened memories of the almost forgotten homeland. Hot tears sprang to her eyes. All the old fears and bitter prejudices dropped away like a discarded garment. A healing peace enveloped her. The wind, pungent with sage and mesquite, swept up from the valley floor, singing through the fluted towers and pinnacles, calling to her, begging her to listen to the voice of the desert. \"We are the everlasting hills, broken and sifted for your coming, O you strong ones!\" they whispered. \"We have grown hungry for the plowshare, thirsty for the harnessed waters of yonder river. Only the strong and fearless can subdue us. From our loins the fig tree and the vine shall spring, the pomegranate redden. Endure to the end, you faithful, that your children and your children's children may reap the harvest of your vision.\" She heard as only those who strive to love the desert can hear and understand. She began to hum in unison with the hidden chorus, and as she sang its message clarified within her heart. She saw Jim climbing up over the ledges to find her, the old proud look rekindling in his eyes as she ran down the trail toward him. LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 10?Brigham Young's Call to Leadership Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, November 6, 1945 Objective: To show the power of leadership under God. A N erect, broad-shouldered man in the vigor of his early forties stood one August afternoon in the year 1844 to address a multitude of saints. There were pain and anxiety in the faces that looked up at him, and a silence known only when the great moments of life hush human hearts. He began: Attention all! This congregation makes me think of the days of King Benjamin, the multitude being so great that all could not hear. I request the brethren not to have any feelings for being convened this afternoon, for it is necessary; we want you all to be still and give attention that all may hear. Let none complain because of the situation of the congregation, we will do the best we can (D. H. C., Vol. VII, page 252). Rows upon rows of men bearing the Priesthood of God appeared in order according to their various quorums. As of one mind they listened. Here was a man, a courageous leader, who had cut short his recent missionary assignment to the East to hasten home. His friends Page 498 needed him, for they, too, had heavy hearts like his. \"Brother Joseph,\" their Prophet, lay dead, his voice was stilled, his sight taken. He had been their voice and their sight these many years. Who now was to hear the voice of the Lord and speak? Martyred while yet in his thirties, how could the people of this modern seer be expected to think so soon of the days when another would be appointed to lead the Church? That time had now come with shocking reality, and, within the hours of the day before them, there was a decision to be made. Would the Church be lead by a \"guardian\" or a president? It was Brigham Young who now stood before the assemblage to help the saints in their hour of decision. There was a firmness in his voice and a strength in his delivery which was so needed at this hour. Sidney Rigdon, who had spoken at the morning session of this August 8th conference, seemed too sure of his position as the rightful \"guardian to build the church unto Joseph,\" LESSON DEPARTMENT 499 as he put it, to satisfy the hunger in the hearts of the saints. Yet Rigdon was a counselor to Joseph and had been with the Prophet during many of the most marvelous manifestations of the early years of the Church. Surely his claim to leadership could not be overlooked. But somehow the people felt the need of the voice that could speak the mind and will of the Lord on this most significant point, and Brother Rigdon had lost most of that sweet spirit so present among those in perfect fellowship. He had, because of his self interests, left Nauvoo for Pittsburgh sometime before the martyrdom of the Prophet (Doc. And Gov. 124:108-9). The saints could not but feel that his return now at this most critical hour of the Church had something of the opportunist element in it. In the afternoon of August 7 at 4 P. M., the day before the open-air gathering above described, there was held a meeting of the Church authorities at Nauvoo. A majority of the Quorum of the Twelve was present, together with the high council, the high priests, and the seventies. President William Marks of the Nauvoo Stake prayed, and President Brigham Young called upon Sidney Rigdon to speak, who said: The object of my mission is to visit the saints and offer myself to them as a guardian, I had a vision at Pittsburgh, June 27th. This was presented to my mind not as an open vision, but rather a continuation of the vision mentioned in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. It was shown to me that this Church must be built up to Joseph,... And I must come to Nauvoo and see that the Church is governed in a proper manner. Joseph sustains the same relationship to this Church as he has always 'done. No man can be the successor of Joseph. The kingdom is to be built up to Jesus Christ through Joseph; there must be revelation still. The martyred Prophet is still the head of this Church; every quorum should stand as you stood in your washings and consecrations. I have been consecrated a spokesman to Joseph, and I was commanded to speak for him. The Church is not disorganized though our head is gone. We may have a diversity of feelings on this matter. I have been called to be a spokesman unto Joseph, and I want to build up the Church unto him; and if the people want me to sustain this place, I want it upon the principle that every individual shall acknowledge it for himself. I propose to be a guardian to the people; in this I have discharged my duty and done what God has commanded me, and the people can please themselves whether they accept me or not (D. H. C. Vol. VII, pp. 229-230). At the conclusion of Brother Rigdon's remarks. President Brigham Young rose to his feet and said: I do not care who leads the Church, even though it were Ann Lee; but one thing I must know, and that is what God says about it. I have the keys and the means of obtaining the mind of God on the subject. I know there are those in our midst who will seek the lives of the Twelve as they did the lives of Joseph and Hyrum. We shall ordain others and give the fulness of the priesthood, so that if we are killed the fulness of the priesthood may remain. Joseph conferred upon our heads all the keys and powers belonging to the Apostleship which he himself held before he was taken away, and no man or set of men can get between Joseph and the Twelve in this world or in the world to come. How often has Joseph said to the Twelve, \"I have laid the foundation and you must build thereon, for upon your shoulders the kingdom rests.\" The Twelve, as a quorum, will not be permitted to tarry here long; they will go abroad and bear off the kingdom to the nations of the earth, and baptize the people faster than mobs can kill them off. I would like, were it my privilege, to take my valise and travel and preach till we had a people gathered who would be true. My private feelings would be to let the affairs of men and women alone, only go and preach and baptize them into the kingdom of God; yet, whatever duty God places upon me, in his strength I intend to fulfill it. I want to see this people, with the various quorums of the priesthood, assembled together in special conference on Thursday next at 10 a.m. (Ibid. page 230). A comparison of these two speeches strikingly shows the difference between leadership subservient to the will of the Lord and that prompted by the power of pride and self-esteem. The Savior pointed the way when he said, \"... Not my will, but thine, be done\" (Luke 22:42); \"... Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister\" (Matt. 20:26). God blesses the leader and increases his powers of leadership if he will but be humble and seek instructions from the mind of the Lord. As if having accepted the spirit of Brigham Young on this day, the Lord miraculously manifested his will concerning this man who was to follow in the footsteps of Joseph. Before the assembled saints, that August afternoon, President Young spoke. The spirit of inspiration was his: Heretofore you have had a Prophet as the mouth of the Lord to speak to you, but he has sealed his testimony with his blood, and now, for the first time, are you called to walk by faith, not by sight.... I now wish to speak of the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If the Church is organized, and you want to know how it is organized, I will tell you. I know your feelings?do you want me to tell your feelings...? The Twelve are appointed by the finger of God. Here is Brigham, have his knees ever faltered? Have his lips ever quivered? Here is Heber and the rest of the Twelve, an independent body who have the keys of the priesthood?the keys of the kingdom of God to deliver to all the world: this is true, so help me God. They stand next to Joseph, and are as the First Presidency of the Church. (See Doc. And Gov. 107:23-24.) I do not know whether my enemies will take my life or not, and I do not care, for I want to be with the man I love. You cannot fill the office of a prophet, seer and revelator: God must do this. You are like children without a father and sheep without a shepherd. You must not appoint any man at our head; if you should, the Twelve must ordain him. You cannot appoint a man at our head; but if you do want any other man or men to lead you, take them and we will go our way to build up the kingdom in all the world. I know who are Joseph's friends, and who are his enemies. I know where the keys of the kingdom are, and where they will eternally be. You cannot call a man to be a prophet; you cannot take Elder Rigdon and place him above the Twelve; if so, he must be ordained by them.... Brother Joseph, the Prophet, has laid the foundation for a great work, and we will build upon it; you have never seen the quorums built one upon another. There is an almighty foundation laid, and we can build a kingdom such as there never was in the world: we can build a kingdom faster than satan can kill the saints off.... I will ask, who has stood next to Joseph and Hyrum? I have, and I will stand next to him. We have a head, and that head is the Apostleship, the spirit and power of Joseph, and we can now begin to see the necessity of that Apostleship (Ibid. pp. 232-235). It was during this inspiring speech that the transfiguration of Brigham Young occurred. The late President George Q. Cannon wrote of this event: If Joseph had arisen from the dead and again spoken in their hearing, the effect could not have been more startling than LESSON DEPARTMENT 501 it was to many present at that meeting; it was the voice of Joseph himself; and not only was it the voice of Joseph which was heard, but it seemed in the eyes of the people as if it were the very person of Joseph which stood before them. A more wonderful and miraculous event than was wrought that day in the presence of that congregation we never heard of. The Lord gave his people a testimony that left no room for doubt as to who was the man chosen to lead them. In the Journal of Elder William C. Staines of the date of August 8, 1844, AXA following statement is recorded: \"Brigham Young said: 'I will tell you who your leaders or guardians will be?the Twelve?I at their head.' This was with the voice like the voice of the Prophet Joseph. I thought it was he, and so did thousands who heard it. This was very satisfactory to the people, and a vote was taken to sustain the Twelve in their office, which with a few dissenting voices, was passed.\" Wilford Woodruff described the event as follows: \"If I had not seen him with my own eyes, there is no one that could have convinced me that it was not Joseph Smith, and anyone can testify to this who was acquainted with these two men\" (Deseret Evening News, March 12, 1892). At the conclusion of President Young's remarks, Amasa Lyman, W. W. Phelps, and Parley P. Pratt spoke; then a vote was taken on the question as to whether the saints should have a \"guardian\" as a leader or the Twelve as the head who rightfully stood in line of authority next to the First Presidency. The hands raised showed a universal vote for the Twelve. In this manner the apostles, who were the rightful authorities according to the revelations of the Lord, were sustained by the vote of the people and by common consent, as the Lord had commanded that all things should be done. The matter of succession was' properly and rightfully decided, and was now binding on the members of the Church (Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, page Sidney Rigdon and William Marks were hurt by the action taken that day, and later found themselves outside the favor of the Church. Rigdon returned to Pittsburgh, Marks drifted away to Beaver Island in Lake Michigan where he joined the followers of James J. Strang. Both men were excommunicated. Brigham Young, having met the qualifications of leadership, was to go forward with the saints. Under the power of his office and endowed with wisdom from on high this great leader was to raise \"up an ensign on the mountains\" (Isa. 18:3) unto which all nations were to flow. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, read the question; second, read the assigned part of the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word\" which has been written especially for us in this day. 1. Who took the presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ in the meridian of time after the Savior left the earth? Read Doc. And Cov. Commentary, pages 307-308. 2. How long in advance of the death of the Prophet Joseph did the Lord give word as to how the Church leadership would be carried on? Read Doc. And Cov. 43:1-7; also page 819 Doc. And Cov. Commentary. Doc. And Cov. 90:4; 107:24; 103:15-18. 3. What do you know as to the character of Brigham Young? Read Doc. And Cov. 126, also pages 983-984 Doc. And Cov. Commentary. 4. Compare the words of Brigham Young and Sidney Rigdon found in this lesson from the point of view of leadership under God. Visiting Teachers' Messages sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 2?\"Charity Suffereth Long and Is Kind\" Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, November 6, 1945 Objective: To inspire patience and kindness in our human relations. THE most beautiful story of and is ?charity that suffereth long and is kind\" to be found in all literature we believe, is Jesus' \"Parable of the Prodigal Son.\"\nImagine the father's suffering when his younger son said to him (after he had worked and saved all his days for his children), \"Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.\" The father may well have guessed how his younger son would waste \"his substance in riotous living.\" When the boy \"came to himself\" and started home, penitent, his father saw him \"when he was yet a great way off.\" Seeing him, he had every right to rebuke him, to remind him of his folly and sins, to crush him in his shame, but instead he \"had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\" But let us not forget either that to his older son he said, \"All that I have is thine.\" While the younger came back repentant, he did not share again.\nWhy was the father so long-suffering and kind? Because he was thinking not of his own wounded self but of the lad's life. The only thing that mattered now was that his son had come \"to himself\"? that \"this my son was dead, and alive again; he was lost, and is found\" (Luke 15:11-32). There is no more effective way to express charity than in kindness. Many people have no need of material help, which, anyway, is soon exhausted. Physical resources, too, are definitely limited. Yet there is no one who is not in need of kindness. And kindness, like all spiritual gifts, such as knowledge, love, and mercy, increases with giving.\nChildren need, above all things, kindness and love. Living in a world organized largely for the comfort, convenience, and advantage of grownups, they often live in fear of harsh words, scoldings, spankings, or indifference.\nA friend told us of an ideal family where there were a large number of children, happy, cooperative, free from quarreling and wrangling. We asked her how she explained the success.\nShe replied, \"I don't know, but their mother never raises her voice.\" This suggests strongly that the mother's charity includes patience and kindness.\nDoes kindness preclude discipline at home or in church work? Not at all! Discipline has the same root as disciple, which means learn, that is, to be a follower. The only effective discipline of a child's moral or spiritual nature is one which is preceded, followed, and surrounded with kindness. And kindness is born of charity and love.\nLiterature\nThe Bible in Our Literature\nLesson 2?How the Bible Is Woven into Our Literature\nDr. Howard R. Driggs\nFor Tuesday, November 25, 1945\nSOME college students, taking a course in literature teaching, were stirred to active discussion one day by this statement from their instructor: \"A good working knowledge of the Bible is absolutely essential to success in the teaching of our English and American literature.\"\n\"But we are not allowed to teach the Bible in the public schools,\" came a response.\n\"Not from any sectarian viewpoint,\" said the instructor. \"It would be un-American to do so. Yet, how can our literature be adequately taught without constant reference to the Bible?\"\n\"I am not sure just what you mean,\" said another student.\n\"Well, let us put some concreteness into the explanation. Most of you are teachers of literature. What are some selections you are called on to teach?\"\n\"Evangeline,\" \"Vision of Sir Launfal,\" \"L'Envoi,\" \"Snow-bound,\" came replies.\n\"They will serve our purpose,\" said the instructor. \"Listen carefully now to some lines from the poems named:\nAnd as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps, As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar. ?\"Evangeline,\" (Part III), Longfellow\nDaily, with souls that cringe and plot, We Sinne climb and know it not. ?\"Vision of Sir Launfal,\" Lowell\nThey shall find real saints to draw from? Magdalene, Peter, and Paul; They shall work at age at a sitting, and never get tired at? ?\"L'Envoi,\" Kipling\n\"Take, eat,\" he said, \"and be content, These fishes in my stead are sent By Him who sent the tangled ram, To spare the child of Abraham.\" ?\"Snowbound,\" Whittier\n\"How can any of these, or hundreds of other lines containing like allusions, be explained without a knowledge of the Bible?\"\n\"But aren't those examples somewhat old-fashioned?\" asked a student.\n\"Your question seems to imply that modern authors are not weaving\nthe Bible into their creations. Well, here is a volume called Contemporary Verse. Perhaps it will help us to find an answer. Glancing through its table of contents I find a few titles that recall interesting hues: Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree. ?\"Trees,\" Joyce Kilmer They gave their merry lives away For Country and for God. ?\"Spires of Oxford,\" Winifred Betts And he who loves the least of these (And here I say and here repeat) Shall win himself an angel's pleas For mercy at my judgment seat. ?\"The Outlaw,\" Robert Service Thank God for a world where none may shirk, Thank God for the splendor of work. ?\"Work,\" Angela Morgan America! Americal God mend thine every flaw. Confirm thy soul in self control, Thy liberty in law. ?\"America the Beautiful,\" Katharine Lee Bates Give them this for the morrow's meat, Then shall we feast in accord; Our half a loaf will then be sweet. Sweet as the bread of the Lord! ?\"How Oswald Dined with God,\" Edwin Markham No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days and nights; Years prophetical! ?\"Years of the Modern,\" Walt Whitman OK I go wherever men may dare, I go wherever woman's care And love can live? Wherever strength and skill can bring Surcease to human suffering Or solace give. ?\"The Red Cross Spirit Speaks,\" John H. Finley Are not these lines from recent poetry all linked with the Bible? Joyce Kilmer's artistic tribute to God's surpassing power of creation; the touching lines of Winifred Betts to merry-hearted youth giving their all for country and for God; the use of precious words from the Savior by Robert Service; the gratitude expressed by Angela Morgan for God-given work?all clearly show that source of inspiration. In the prayer of Katherine Lee Bates for America?vital today and always ?that our liberty be preserved in Law, we feel the Bible spirit. It vibrates also in the lines of Edwin Markham, picturing a king sharing with the poor; and in Walt Whitman's words, so applicable to the living present. In John H. Finley's tribute to the Red Cross, one feels the helpful, courageous spirit of the Savior. In much of the literature of today the heart of the Good Samaritan vibrates. Such expression of gospel service is surely Bible-inspired. Of course, these illustrations from more modern poetry are somewhat different from those cited from earlier poets. Fashions change in literature as in other things; yet the constants are ever present. When the Bible came, it brought certain of these constants: reverence for God, charity, humility, service, sacrifice, a more democratic spirit, and other spiritual gifts for our salvation. It was like the pouring of a river, limpid and pure, into the old turbid stream of life. All our art expression since then has been clarified, enriched, inspirited by the divine contribution. LESSON DEPARTMENT 505 This is shown in both tangible and intangible changes wrought in our literature. As aleady illustrated, authors, particularly those of earlier years, made many more direct allusions to stories and characters of the Bible. It was the enriching thing to do. When Lowell, for example, says that daily \"We Sinais climb and know it not,\" his line brings back the story of Moses going up into the mountain to commune with God. The poet also suggests that, without knowing it, we get close to God each day. To understand the inner meaning of this allusion, one must know the Bible story that lies back of it. Another tangible way the Bible is woven into lines of literature is by use of Biblical expressions-words, phrases, and even sentences. How deeply indebted our language is to this contribution may be more clearly realized by something of a comparison of literature today with that of pre-Bible days. Go back to the Northland myths for illustration. In these tales one finds a goodly number of words suggestive of brute strength, skill with weapons of trickery, cunning, deceit, of feasting, drinking, carousing, of giants, sorcery, mystery. Few, if any, words are found expressive of charity, meekness, kindliness, benevolence, tolerance, forgiveness, brotherhood, holidays (holy days). These, and like expressions of gospel import, came into our mother tongue largely through the Bible. Less tangible than words and allusions, yet even more vital, are the changes wrought through the influence of the Bible on the inner spirit of literature. It brought what may well be called a leavening effect on all forms of art. More hope, more joy, more faith, more whole-someness came to the varied kinds of expression. Naturally, literature was lightened and brightened and given added meaning and purpose by this spiritualizing force. With much of our great literature this infusion of new warmth and life and strength is to be felt rather than seen. Bible thought and themes are often so deftly woven into the creation by the author that, unless one is well-schooled in scripture, the close connection might be missed. Yet the stirring lessons of truth are there. It is the artistry of authorship not to preach them, but to portray them. In further studies, an interesting quest will be to find some of these Bible messages at the heart of time-tested literature. True it is that certain writers reveal precious little of Bible influence in what they produce. With cynical disregard of that source of inspiration, they have gone their own irreverent ways. Sometimes they create daring, cleverly-written literature, which, for the moment, wins wide attention. Then it as suddenly flickers out, as all such creations, if unsound and unwholesome, are almost sure to do. Folk may read, but few reread literature of that type. Our conviction is that authors do their finest, most lasting work when they are true to truth, when they produce that which is clean and artistic, when they help to overcome evil with good. There is no call here for \"preach-iness\" in literature; neither is there any exclusion of choice literature created for wholesome entertainment. Happily, we have many delightful creations which open our eyes and ears to the beauties of nature, to the joys of childhood, to home pleasures and uplifting friendships. Some of the selections help to cultivate in us a clean sense of humor, to get more pure enjoyment out of life. Outwardly or inwardly this literature may make no reference to the Bible; yet the spirit of goodness and wholesome fun is in it, and truly we need it to add a bit of leaven to our days. Something more than just this lightsome literature is also needed for our upbuilding. That is the literature which brings real re-creation. Such literature, as already portrayed, leaves us both mentally and spiritually uplifted. It brings to us lessons of truth and light. It leads us along paths of righteousness. It is Bible-inspired. Discussion and Activities 1. Why is a knowledge of the Bible essential in the study of English and American literature? Be ready with an illustration to prove the point. 2. (a) What is meant by a Biblical allusion? (b) Make your meaning clearer by giving in brief the incident or meaning suggested by each of the following expressions: \"like showers of manna\"; \"toiling up new Calvaries\"; \"our Lord's beatitudes\"; \"in Eden's delight\"; \"like the Patmos saint.\" 3. (a) Join with the class in making a list of twenty or more words other than those given in this lesson, which probably have come into our language through the Bible, (b) What in a spiritual sense is indicated by this enrichment of our vocabulary? 4. In what other vital way than by allusions and words has the Bible influenced our literature? Illustrate. 5. What type of literature may show no such Biblical influence and yet be of value in our lives? Give illustrations. 6. What are some of the spiritual qualities that characterize literature that brings not only entertainment, but re-creation? Name one selection that you feel has these qualities. 7. Point out, with illustrations, a difference in the way authors of earlier times and today reflect the Bible influence in their writings. Science Modern Applications of Moral Principles Lesson 9?Problems of Personal Conduct Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, November 27, 1945 Lesson link: We attempted last time to apply the moral principle of brotherhood to several specific social situations. It was shown how prejudice and animosity lead toward patterns of discrimination and persecution in the modern world. Religious intolerance was used as an example of the contemporary moral crisis in both Christianity and democracy. Lesson aim: To stress the importance of personal cleanliness, balanced conduct, and self-control to the good life. IT has been said earlier that the good life depends upon both personal and social factors; that the highest morality, which results in the greatest joy, comes from individual health and advancement plus love and service oriented toward others. Last month we looked at the brotherhood principle and examined a few of its perversions. This time we will turn attention to some of the moral problems of personal conduct.\nLife is a process of continual adjustment to new situations, and where individuals lag or fail in their adjustment, personal and social problems result. Since the best adjustment means the most progress and the greatest happiness, anything short of the best possible adjustment is wrong. But adjustment is difficult, and there seems to be an all too-common human tendency to dodge that which is hard and remote in favor of the easy way leading to immediate thrills. Hence the prevalence of human suffering. When the energies of man become dissipated in the attempt to circumvent truth and escape consequences, opportunities are missed and misery ensues. It is to some of these dissipations leading to personal maladjustment and unhappiness that attention is now turned.\nDrugs\nThe use of narcotics produces a temporary sense of pleasantness or well-being and permits the sufferer to forget for awhile his mental fears and conflicts. It is perhaps this element of escape from unpleasant reality that explains the rather wide\nThe proportion of the population addicted to the more serious drugs such as opium, heroin, morphine, and cocaine, is probably not very large; although occasionally we read of \"dope rings\" being uncovered and some authorities estimate that there are more than one million addicts in this country alone. Sometimes the habit is picked up innocently such as through the use of sleeping pills, pain-killers, or patent medicines. In using narcotic medicines, even under a doctor's prescription, great care should be exercised to use them moderately and only as absolutely needed. Once the habit is formed, the user's system has then become conditioned to the drug and he is a virtual slave to its use. Addiction to the use of drugs frequently results in poverty, ill-health, and crime, and the cure, if any be possible, requires rather long and expensive treatment at the hands of the psychiatrist.\nA more serious problem than the taking of opiates and cocaine is the smoking of marijuana cigarettes?more serious because this drug is consumed largely by the young, because its results are particularly demoralizing, and because it may be even more widespread than the other practices. Under the influence of marijuana, restraint, moral judgment, and self-control are gone, and acts are frequently indulged in that head the boy and girl toward degradation. Marijuana comes from an innocent looking weed, and although many states by now have laws attempting its control, its suppression is proving particularly difficult. The taking of caffeine, nicotine, and other narcotic substances into the body through the use of certain drinks and through smoking is also habit forming and body harming. Our Church literature is replete with good material on these subjects. (See section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants, and consult also some of the many articles and chapters on the Word of Wisdom found in the magazines and books of the Church.) Drink Just as drug addiction is an attempted escape from unpleasant reality and a crutch for unstable characters, so also is the use of alcoholic beverages. People who drink do so, for the most part, to forget the unpleasantries of life and to thereby capture the thrills of the moment. They fail to remember that no one can really escape life; he can only shut his eyes for awhile, stumble, and get behind in the race. The magnitude of the liquor problem is alarming. Some three or four billion dollars go into this industry in America each year, and, since alcohol is not a necessity, most of this is wasted money. But the greatest waste is human waste. Families are neglected and abused; lives are dissipated and shortened; accidents are increased, resulting in the death and maiming of many; morals are relaxed and crimes increased, particularly sex crimes; insanity very frequently overtakes the one so indulging. This human wreckage resulting from drink in the modern world, when all brought together, does not make a pretty picture. People who drink \"to be a good sport\" or because they think it is \"smart\" should remember that sportmanship without principle is a mirage, and that always the smart thing to do is the right thing. Those who drink to \"forget\" should remember that their euphoria is but illusionary and that in so behaving they only build up a vicious circle, for they only create more bad memories that they will want to forget. Gambling In one sense life is a gamble, for it is so filled with uncertainties and anomalies and it requires so much faith and courage to see it through. But there is a vast difference between this courage in the face of uncertainties in the struggle upward and the willful play on chance for the purpose of getting something for nothing; the one gives evidence of faith and results in effort and progress, while the other is based on selfishness and laziness alone. This \"something for nothing\" philosophy of life, coupled with the idea that \"only the foolish work,\" makes of gambling an escape device designed to side-step morals for the sake of money. Large scale gambling involving cards, roulette wheels, and such, is illegal in most states; but illegal or not it finds ways of functioning under cover in many of the nation's \"best\" communities. Hidden from the police or \"protected\" by city officials, professional gamblers in especially prepared rooms encourage the gullible to participate in these nefarious activities; and through techniques well known to themselves, make sure that the \"house\" gets a heavy cut out of the winnings. LESSON DEPARTMENT 509 The spirit of gambling, once it has taken hold of a person, is like a narcotic or a liquor in its deadening and maddening effects. The thrill of an occasional win is enough to tide over several substantial losses and, in this way, keep the losing spiral going viciously downward until the participant's money is all gone. Always there is the thought, the desperate hope, that next time he can beat the game and then he will stop; but next time he loses once more, or, if he should win, there is the untempered greed that won't let him quit. Parents and community workers (and all parents should be vitally and actively interested in the welfare of the community) will do well to realize that the road to gambling frequently starts at the juvenile \"joint\" where there are marble games and slot machines to whet the appetite of the young. If these could be cleaned out or changed to eliminate the pay-off feature, as some of our communities have been farsighted enough to do, a great step in moral progress would be made. But this is not all. In addition, parents should teach their children that all things worth while cost effort, honestly and honorably given. Unchastity Sex life motivated by love and protected by marriage is sanctioned by society and blessed by deity. It is the misuse of sex that is immoral; practices impelled by selfish lust and irresponsible exploitation. That which is beautiful and sacred is too frequently cheapened and defiled by means of the vulgar remark, the smutty story, the erotic show, the lewd magazine, et cetera. Vulgarity is the profanity of virtue. When sexual irregularities are carried beyond the mental, the verbal, and the visual into the realm of overt conduct, the moral issue involved becomes particularly great. Unchastity, whether in premarital relations or extramarital relations after marriage, presents one of the most serious moral problems of the day. The following are some of the most important reasons for maintaining chastity: (1) It is a commandment of God. (2) It is sanctioned by society. The social stigma leveled by society against the offender often results in loss of both social position and employment, which is a high price to pay for a reckless moment. (3) It is necessary for mental health and peace of mind. The worries, fears, and guilt feelings connected with unchastity are sometimes enough to cause frustrations leading to chronic unhappiness, nervousness, and even psychosis. (4) It is important from the standpoint of physical health. The venereal diseases, resulting largely from sexual promiscuity, are among the most loathsome and miserable ailments of man. (5) It safeguards against premarital pregnancy followed by induced abortion, illegitimacy or forced marriage. (6) It is compatible with happy and successful marriage. In any number of ways unchastity may interfere with emotional and sexual adjustment in marriage. Statistical studies bear out the fact that those marriages are most successful where both partners have been chaste before the ceremony. To a Latter-day Saint there is no question of a double standard. Chastity is expected of the man and woman alike.\nExcesses\nBalance is a virtue that many, in their zeal to stress one certain point or principle fail to reach. Overemphasis on one thing usually means underemphasis on others, with the result that the total is misshapen. Things that are good in and of themselves are bad when overindulged in. Food, for example, is good, but overeating is a vice; fasting is a rich spiritual experience, but overfasting may lead to physical harm; athletics are good as exercise, but overtraining may burn the body out. It is possible to have too much of a good thing.\nBecause of this, it becomes ever so important that we learn to \"see life steadily and as a whole.\" Distorted reality is, for all practical purposes, falsehood; and it leads to misdirected, abortive living.\nIn the field of personal conduct temperance is the keystone to virtue. The best way is the middle way. Life should be active, but in a balanced, harmonious way rather than impetuous or distorted. Steady is the word.\nAnti-social Behavior\nEvery individual is an intrinsic part of society, and because of this it is impossible to make any clearcut distinction between public and private morals. All of these personal standards of which we have the lesson are harmful to society as well\nas to the individuals who themselves indulge. Drinking, for example, may mean neglect of family, and unchastity may ruin two lives and bring sorrow to many others. Some people argue that, \"What I do is my own business,\" but any thinking person can see that this is not true. We are our brother's keeper and our personal habits as well as our social acts affect profoundly those around us.\nAnti-personal behavior then, is also anti-social behavior.\nBut some people go farther than this, and either thoughtlessly or willfully work against the best interests of the larger group. This is not the place to enter into any detailed analysis of crime and delinquency, but it is to be noted that the problem is extensive and that it is always greatest when personal disorganization is widespread, such as, for example, in time of war. Unless personal conduct can be made to be \"right\" in so far as the individual is concerned, and also right in the sense that it is directed toward the welfare of society, the standards of a higher morality will continue to be missed. It is the social slant in personal conduct that provides the highest moral test.\nThe Way Out\nBut regardless of how serious the problem may be, there is always a way out for those who are willing to plot the ground. There are too many today who, discouraged or blinded by the distance life has fallen, decide to lie there or even slip deeper rather than exert themselves for a better future. Life is\neternal, and progress is endless for those who climb; and every man can climb regardless of the point from which he must start. LESSON DEPARTMENT 511 The way out of the blind alleys in which many find themselves today is the way of repentance. Repentance is the key by which man can be unshackled from the follies of the past and the weaknesses of the present. More of us need to get the forward point of view. After a mistake has been made, as regrettable as it may be, it is then the future that is important. The past should be forgotten as rapidly as it can be atoned for. But repentance requires in addition to (i) remorse, both (2) restitution, and (3) reform; it is not enough to feel sorry, but the wrong done must be righted and the tendency to do wrong must be corrected. Man should learn to accept his mistakes as his own rather than projecting them upon society or the 'devil; and he should learn to repent, face the situation, throw away his crutches, and with his head up look and work for a better life. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Do you see any relationship between private and public morality? Explain. Show how the private behavior patterns discussed in this lesson affect others in society as well as the offender. 2. Analyze the major causes and effects of (a) drug addiction, (b) alcoholism, (c) gambling, and (d) unchastity. 3. Why is excess, or lack of balance, a moral problem? Discuss. Defend the \"middle way\" as a way of life. Does this justify the moderate use of tobacco, alcohol, et cetera? Why not? 4. What is meant by anti-social conduct? Are crime and delinquency immoral? Why? 5, What is the way out for the problem of personal conduct discussed in this lesson? Can you make any additional suggestions, being a little more specific, perhaps, than lesson space permitted here? What does repentance involve? Would you say that repentance is necessary to a moral life? Discuss pro and con.

Rain-wet, the darkness around us creeps, Silence broods over the sleeping men? A longing for the homeland over me sweeps Where the soul can sing itself free again... * * * The bladed corn gleamed in the noonday heat When I rode away from my father's door. Past the golden fields of the ripened wheat * And beyond the hill... Then this alien shore. Tonight in the darkness my thoughts wing home To the fragrant meadows where killdeers cry... To tree-fringed acres of harrowed loam Under cloud-patterned shadows of western sky... At the wheat field's end I climb the stile To walk in the shade of the locust lane. From the pasture the milch cows slowly file And the sunset reddens the west again. To the east, blue mountains notch the sky And farmlands reach up to the foothill's side. To the west, going home, the gray gulls fly Where the inland waters are crimson dyed. The herd boy fastens the pasture bars And birds in the hedges drowsily fret. The night will be clear with an arc of stars For the west still burns where the sun has set. Through deepening shadows the swift creek flows Splashing the footbridge that sways with the strain; Through lace-curtained windows the lamplight glows On white moths futilely beating the pane...

This recognition came to her because of the great work she accomplished in forwarding the cause of woman suffrage in America. For forty-eight years she devoted herself to this great movement, traveling throughout the country, speaking, lecturing, debating, and organizing the women into working units. She even swept halls, carried chairs and benches, bought and placed candles for lighting, and then did the speaking. She also traveled in Europe, discussing woman suffrage with noted men and women in both England and Germany.\nShe was associated in this pioneer movement with a number of forward-looking leaders, but there were three who stood closest to her and gave the greatest support. They were Elizabeth Cady Stanton who was known as the true mother of woman suffrage in the United States?for that matter in the world, organizing as she did the first Woman's Rights Convention in the world, at Seneca Falls in 1848; Lucretia Mott, the\neloquent Quaker preacher and anti-slavery leader; and Lucy Stone, social reformer, who stood and worked for all types of social betterment, and who, after graduation from college, a rare privilege for women in those days, decided that she would dedicate her life to make life easier and better for women. These four leaders were called the Big Four, and the Four Giants of the early suffrage movement, but Susan B. Anthony carried the major part of the burden and was known throughout the nation as the greatest and mightiest warrior for women.\nOne who wrote her life says:\nEvery girl who now enjoys a college education; every woman who earns a living in any profession or trade; every wife who is protected in the property which she owns; every mother who has an equal right with the father to the custody and control of her children; every woman who belongs to a club and works for individual and civic improvement; every woman who is privileged to vote owes these sacred privileges to Susan B. Anthony above all others.\nMiss Anthony did not live to see the fulfillment of her dream, which was full suffrage for women, but her spirit ever carried on as a guide and inspiration to her successors. She passed away in 1906 at the age of eighty-six, fourteen years before the crest of victory?the passage and ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which occurred in 1920 and which gave the vote to women.\nSusan B. Anthony was fortunate in her heritage, background, and early training. Page 519 GROUP OF NATIONAL AND LATTER-DAY SAINT SUFFRAGE LEADERS, 1895 Lower row, left to right: President Zina D. H. Young, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, Susan B. Anthony, Sarah M. Kimball, Mary C. C. Bradford. Top row, left to right: Mrs. Ellis Meredith, Margaret A. Caine, Electa Bullock, Dr. Mattie Hughes Cannon, Phebe Y. Beattie, Emily S. Richards, Emmeline B. Wells, Rebecca E. Little, Augusta W. Grant. Born in a Quaker home, she was reared in an atmosphere of freedom, independence, and moral zeal. She was a precocious child, learning to read at the age of three. She had an unusual memory, an inquisitive mind, and a great desire for learning. She had fair opportunity for schooling as the elementary schools of the Quakers were open to girls as well as boys. Then there was a period of training at a female seminary in Pennsylvania where she prepared to be a teacher. With her sisters she was encouraged by her father to be industrious, to find a gainful occupation, and to strive for independence. For one who was in later life to champion humanitarian causes, including the rights of women, she was fortunate in being a member of the society of Friends which gave unusual opportunities for women members. From the very beginning the Quakers had given women an equal place with men in their church services and their church government. Women were permitted to speak in church whenever they felt inclined to do so, and some even rose to the dignity of regular preachers. It was only natural, therefore, that this church furnished many of the early American women leaders who worked for temperance, anti-slavery, equal rights, and suffrage. Miss Anthony began her public career at the age of seventeen as a school teacher in Conajoharie, New York. SUSAN B. ANTHONY 521 She was happy and successful in her work, but she was not satisfied to confine her interests and activities entirely to the schoolroom. She was intelligent, well-read, a careful thinker, had great power as an executive and organizer. She was public spirited and she felt the urge to widen her horizon and enlarge her field of effort. She was interested in all the public questions of her day, and set out to tackle some of the social and economic problems. She insisted that women felt the same call to serve and help with the world's work as men, and might prove as able. She even advanced the revolutionary idea that women were the social and intellectual equals of men, for which she received caustic criticism. \"PROM the days of her childhood she had abhorred human slavery, as did her Quaker father before her. So opposed to slavery was Daniel Anthony that he went to great pains to try to get cotton for his cotton mills which did not have the taint of slave labor. The temperance movement also early claimed Susan's attention and support. So vigorous was she in these two great causes that she was known as a militant abolitionist and a valiant advocate of temperance. In 1852, when she went as a delegate to a joint meeting of the Sons and Daughters of Temperance in Albany, New York, and arose to speak to a motion, she was quickly told that women were not invited to speak, but to listen and learn. In 1853, she attended a teachers' convention at Rochester, N. Y. After listening for hours to a dull discussion on the subject of teaching, she arose and asked permission to speak. The chairman, astounded and perplexed, asked for the pleasure of the convention, and after a one-half hour's discussion and a vote, it was decided by a small majority that she might speak. She attended many public meetings and conventions and when men hoped that she would be silent, she insisted on being heard. Before long Miss Anthony found herself fighting other social evils, in addition to slavery and the evils of drinking, such as low wages for women, the lack of opportunity for higher education and professional training for women, lack of opportunity for holding office in volunteer organizations, and restrictions which kept women from being on an equal plane with men before the law. Like other women reformers. Miss Anthony sensed her limitations. She felt continually handicapped on every side and wondered what could best be done to give women more influence in human affairs. She realized, too, that to attack specific evils and injustices one by one was a slow process. She became convinced that women should work for total freedom. It was at this time (1852) that she became converted to and joined the Woman's Rights Movement, which program included suffrage, and which she was destined to lead. After long years of effort, the Federal Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, granting suffrage to women, was introduced in both the House and the Senate of the United States, April 17, 1913. It was christened the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.Six more years elapsed before Congress passed the Amendment. On May 21, 1919, it passed the House of Representatives and on June 4, 1919, it passed the Senate. Before it could become effective, however, it was necessary that it be ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states. On August 18, the final state to ratify, Tennessee, gave woman suffrage the constitutional majority it needed and victory was won. The amendment which stands now as the law of the land reads as follows: Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. Section 2. Congress shall have power by appropriate legislation to enforce the provisions of this article. Susan B. Anthony was a faithful and loyal friend to the women of Utah. She kept in touch with them all during her period of leadership, and they worked closely with her in the cause dearest to her heart. She visited Utah on a number of occasions, and from the year 1879 Utah sent delegates regularly to the meetings of the National Suffrage Association, where they took active part in the deliberations. She rejoiced with them when they had the vote from 1870 to 1886; and because of their experience and knowledge and their training in organization work, she solicited their interest and help in her national program. She sympathized with them when they were disfranchised by the Congress of the United States in 1886, and stood by them as a true, faithful friend. She rejoiced again with them when Utah became a state, in April 1895, \"4 44 State constitution included a clause giving them full suffrage. She immediately wrote Mrs. Emily S. Richards of Salt Lake City, Chief Organizer for Utah and a member of the National Executive Committee, as follows: Well I am glad you are all awake to the cause out there in Utah. You have the power in your own hands, and if you do not move on to better things political, it will not be the fault of the men alone, you women will be equally responsible with them. You cannot therefore afford to be idle or indifferent to the political action of your city and state. With love to all and yourself the most, Susan B. Anthony. One month later, May 12, Miss Anthony and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, who were touring the West, visited Utah where they were enthusiastically received. A suffrage conference for two days was held, followed by a reception given in their honor by Mr. And Mrs. F. S. Richards at their beautiful home. Hundreds of people attended, including State officials and military officers from Fort Douglas. Governor Caleb W. West and his staff in full regalia stood in the receiving line with the host and hostess and honored guests. The sincere love of the women of Utah and of the Relief Society for Susan B. Anthony was demonstrated at the time of her death, early in March 1906, when a memorial service was held for her in the Salt Lake City Assembly Hall on Relief Society anniversary day, March 17. To Mothers, Wives, and Sweethearts President Reuben Clark, Jr. Excerpts from an address \"Postwar Planning\" delivered at the Friday afternoon session of the 115th annual general conference, April 6, 1945, in the Assembly Hall. I WOULD like to say a word about the returning soldier, that being a question about which we all talk and hear so much. I said something about postwar planning at the last conference and pointed out that we could and should plan to bring our soldiers back to homes of purity, chastity, and of righteousness, and that it took no worldly position, no wealth, to carry on that postwar planning. I want to add just a word along that line today... To bridge over the time when they [soldiers] return as heroes for achievements in war, until they may resume their peace-time occupations and become heroes in peace and in peaceful occupations, to bridge that over is one of the tasks we shall have to undertake and to which we must give our best effort and best thought. I am not thinking of the temporal side of the bridge-over, I am thinking of the spiritual side, and what that means; and in that connection it seems to me that they who are to play the greater part are the mothers, the wives, and the sweethearts of those who return. When all is said and done it will be our sisters who must take on that great load and that tremendous responsibility. Radio programs, magazines, and newspaper columns are more and more filling with instructions about how to treat our returning soldiers. All the deductions of modem psychology, and its kindred mental sciences are paraded for the guidance of the wives, the mothers, the sweethearts, in meeting, winning, and holding the boy back from the war. But I would not exchange the unerring inspired instinct of a good woman, fired with mother love, or wife love, or the love of a loyal, chaste sweetheart, for all that men have ever written. The boys say they do not wish to be regarded as problem children. They want to get home and enter again the family circle, and in its sacred precincts again to take up life and forget hate, carnage, and death. I believe their cry will be, \"Let us live again in love\"; and you mothers, wives, and sweethearts can bring to them this blessing. None other can. So in this crisis we turn to the women of the earth to save them and to save us men from ourselves. So it has been, in reality, in every great world crisis, however much it may have seemed otherwise. Yours, you sisters, has been the loyalty that has never wanted; your courage has not failed, has not been daunted, whatever the odds. You have often recognized a lost cause long before your men folks; you frequently have seen victory long before it came within the vision of those who battled. Your joy and tenderness and fortitude have succored the wounded and eased the passing of those who are called beyond. You never fail in kindness and mercy; your love endures forever. May God bless you, for you are angels of mercy. So, you mothers, wives, sweethearts, take into the sacred precincts of your heart around the altars of your homes these souls wounded in body, in mind, in spirit, and heal them as you alone. Page 523 Settling Raymond, Alberta, Canada Jennie B. Knight Former Member Relief Society General Board RAYMOND is situated in Southern Alberta, Canada. It was founded by Jesse Knight of Utah, and named after his oldest son. It was built by pioneers who had faith in its future, and it took real pioneers with courage, thrift, good judgment, and faith to cope with problems that confronted the early settlers of that region. That they were victorious and are still a prudent, progressive, and religious people is shown in their beautiful modern homes and schools, churches and public buildings, their farms and ranches, factories, mills and elevators that today dot the land as far as the eyes can see. The name of Jesse Knight is so interwoven in the history of this commonwealth and the surrounding territory that it is fitting to relate how he came to be its founder. He was a man who had implicit confidence in the leaders of his Church. At the ushering in of the twentieth century, President Lorenzo Snow sent his New Year's greeting to the world. This message greatly impressed Brother Knight who at that time was receiving great wealth from his metal mines in Utah. In this message, he read: Men and women of wealth, use your riches to give employment to the laborer! Take the idle from the crowded centers of population and place them on the un-tilled areas that await the hand of industry. Page 524 Unlock your vaults, unloose your purses and embark in enterprises that will give work to the unemployed and relieve the wretchedness that leads to vice and crime around you. Make others happy and you will be happy yourselves. Many propositions had been made to Brother Knight to invest his money, but none appealed to him until he heard about Canada. However, Apostle John W. Taylor and Charles McCarthy of Alberta came to see him and told him of the fertile lands in Southern Alberta and urged him to buy some of the thousands of acres. The project impressed him. He could see the possibility of using his money to magnify his \"stewardship,*' for it was only as a steward, he believed, that wealth came to him. In the spring of 1900, he sent his two sons, Oscar Raymond and Jesse William, to Canada to investigate the situation, the result being that they purchased 30,000 acres of land and set to work to stock it. Later, their father met them in Canada. The weather was ideal, the country beautiful and green. It looked like a real paradise to Jesse Knight. He was there only a few days before he had a clear idea of what he wanted to do. He would build a sugar factory that would give employment to Latter-day Saints and others who would come where they might secure land on easy terms and make homes for their children and themselves. On July 10, 1901, he purchased 226,000 acres of prairie land from the Canadian Northwest Irrigation Company and the Alberta Railroad and Irrigation Company through their agent, Hon. C. A. Magrath. SETTLING RAYMOND, ALBERTA, CANADA 525; THRESHING SCENE IN RAYMOND, CANADA, ON THE HEREFORD RANCH Yield, sixty bushels to the acre He signed a contract to build a sugar factory, and have it ready to handle the beet crop in 1903 and to keep it in operation for twelve years. This contract was guaranteed with a pledge of $50,000. Who but a man of faith could have made such an agreement in so short a time with nothing but a vast, grass-covered prairie surrounding this location? RAYMOND townsite was selected soon after the contract was signed, and on a bright Sunday afternoon, at the request of Presi-ident C. O. Card, friends from neighboring towns and ranches met to dedicate this townsite. There was not a tree, or even a tent to be seen as they stood on the buffalo-trodden soil to participate in the exercises. In the town charter, which was read. Brother Knight had insisted that it contain a forfeiture clause to the effect that if liquor, or gambling houses, or places of ill fame were established on the premises, the property holders would forfeit title to the land. The dedicatory prayer was offered by Apostle John W. Taylor. Songs of praise and thanksgiving filled the air and a feeling of welcome and good will was felt by all. The town of Raymond grew rapidly,, for in less than two years there were over fifteen hundred settled there. Most of them were young, including many college graduates. Buildings sprang up with mushroom rapidity, the blacksmith shop of Ephraim Hicks being the first to break the horizon. Many of the early homes were of the ?lean-to\" type, just one room with a slanting roof to which other rooms were added later. A church with a heating plant was built by Jesse Knight. This and the school house were the first public buildings erected. Charles McCarthy and T. O. And Louis King were the first to build mercantile stores. B. F. Rolf son was a carpenter and his house was the first to be finished. HANNAH GIBBS, who planted the first tree, arrived on September 3, 1901, with her nine children. George Munn, William Lamb, and families came September 2d. They experienced real difficulty in pitching their tents, as there was a bleak blizzard when they emerged from the mixed freight and passenger train. A number of families lived in tents during the first winter. Water for culinary purposes was hauled in barrels from the canal until Ray Knight had it piped into the center of town, and from there it was still hauled to the homes in barrels on sleds. In winter, the water was always frozen in the barrels, and if one wished a drink he had to chop the ice and melt it. Hannah Gibbs became the community nurse and doctor. She had her first experience as midwife March 16, 1902, when the first boy, Raymond Holbrook, was born. This nurse, taught by experience and faith, brought numerous babies into the world. She nursed each mother and babe for ten days for which service she received five dollars. She never lost a case. Even after Dr. Rivers settled in Raymond she was still called in on many occasions. Jessie Nilsson, a girl, was the first child born in Raymond. In the spring of 1902, people came very fast by rail, or overland with teams and wagons, driving their cattle. This spring was very cold and stormy. During one of these bad storms forty-seven new settlers arrived. It was necessary to house them in the church for ten days while other shelters were being provided. Under the direction of the bishop and Relief Society, with the help of neighbors and friends, they enjoyed cooked meals. KNIGHT SUGAR FACTORY, RAYMOND, CANADA Building completed in 1903, and sugar was manufactured that same year SETTLING RAYMOND, ALBERTA, CANADA 527 THE RAYMOND RELIEF SOCIETY was organized in the lean-to in the back of this building, the home of Emma }. Bevan, February 1902. THE ward was organized on October 10, 1901, with Jesse W. Knight as bishop, and Joseph Bevan and Ephraim Hicks as counselors. Brother McCarthy notified the Bishop of this appointment while he and Mrs. Knight were \"riding the range\" on the \"K-2\" ranch, where they were then living. They moved to Raymond and built a home where young couples were married and many royal guests entertained, among them being President Joseph F. Smith and wife, President Francis M. Lyman, Dr. George H. Brimhall, L. H. Hol-brook, and their wives, some of the apostles and their wives, and other Church and government officials, as well as dear friends and associates. The first couple married by Bishop Knight was Katie Pitt and William Jensen of Salt Lake City. They were at the dedication of the townsite. All of the auxiliary organizations were fortunate in having efficient officers from the beginning. The Relief Society commenced its work early in 1902 under the direction of its president Emma J. Bevan, at whose home it was organized. With Counselors Mary J. Selman and Annie Gibbs, with teachers and members, this thrifty organization did a wonderful work, throughout the years it carried on the traditions of charity, love, and preparedness for which it was organized. The Relief Society erected a granary on its own city lot, which was filled with wheat. Later it owned a quarter section of land on which wheat was raised for the benefit of the Society. HOME OF JESSE WILLIAM KNIGHT First bishop of Raymond The year 1903 marked the completion of the sugar factory, the major activity in all that section of the country at that time. Words fail to express what a Herculean task it was to build and operate a sugar factory in so short a time. The land which was covered with tall grass and \"a million mosquitoes to every blade\" had to be prepared to raise beets for the factory. Men and boys who were not building were ploughing and cultivating the land. Warren Depew, a veteran plowman, reports that 3,000 acres were ready on scheduled time. It took the combined efforts of men. Women, and children, augmented by Indians, Chinese, and itinerant laborers to plant, thin, top, and harvest the beets, as well as 150 to 300 men to build and operate the factory. This enterprise was fortunate in the intelligent personnel of the men who supervised the work. Foremost among them was Ephraim P. Ellison, a man of acute understanding and executive ability-. His posterity-are still builders in the Alberta country. Brother J. William Evans, who remained loyal to Raymond to the end. Was the first supervisor of the beet fields and later held important positions in the factory. Along with all the work the women had to do, it fell to their lot to foster the social functions, as related before. The very first Christmas party was given in the meeting house. Sister Elizabeth King, who is still stake president of YW'MIA, and Sister Lamb decorated the building and the tree, and the appropriate program and dance of that date set a pace worthy to be followed. The pioneers who still remain are unanimous in the opinion expressed by Dr. George H. Brimhall, whose sons and daughters were among the first settlers, that: God from on high lights up the way For man to go that's best, He pro\\ides the opportunity, But man must do the rest. FIRST WARD MEETING HOUSE AND TAYLOR STAKE HOUSE, 1941 Stay as Sweet as You Are Ada B. Monson JIMMY was leading the way to the far side of the big waiting room. You shouldn't have come, Mother,? he said. ?Train stations are tough assignments for mothers these days.\" Mrs. Leeder started to speak. Jimmy interrupted, \"Don't say it, Mother, I will?\"the tougher the job, the harder you tackle.\" They both laughed and sat down on a long bench. Jimmy put. His suitcase between them on the seat. They both rested their arms on it and Jimmy put his hand over his mother's. \"Seriously, Mother, Fm very grateful for all the sweet philosophy you've dished up for me. I'm gonna need it, but sure.\" Mrs. Leeder tried to smile, but her chin went wobbly. Then to herself?I musn't cry, I musn't cry. I must talk, that's it, I must talk every minute to keep from crying. Boys in khaki and blue were dashing hatless and coatless in and out of the station between trains. \"They keep that girl at the newsstand really busy, and look, Jimmy, there are Fred and his mother coming in now, see, at the middle door?\" Mrs. Leeder stood up to wave at them. Jimmy put out a restraining hand. \"Let's stay here. Mother,\" he said. Mrs. Leeder sat down, \"Why sure?all right,\" she said. \"You'll get to see them out at the train,\" Jimmy said. He's afraid I'll break down in front of them all, she thought, but she said, \"I hope you two boys can stick together through this like you did through growing up.\" \"Can't though. Fred'll go in the air corps,\" Jimmy said. \"Oh, I didn't know. Poor Ruth. She won't have anyone at home, now.\" \"You be sure and call her up, sometimes.\" \"Oh, I will. Son?every day,\" Mrs. Leeder said. Jimmy smiled. \"She'll be calling you up, too.\" Mrs. Leeder smiled back and a lump came in her throat again. Talk fast, talk fast. \"Fred's mother is a beautiful woman, isn't she?\" \"Yeah,\" Jimmy said, \"clothes do an awful lot.\" Mrs. Leeder put her feet further under the seat and straightened up a bit. \"I guess I could have worn my hat,\" she said, smoothing her hair with a workworn hand. \"I've got those gloves you gave me for Christmas, too.\" Never before had she been so aware of her shabbiness, her lack of style. \"You sure you don't want to see Ruth, Son?\" she asked. Jimmy shook his head. \"We said goodbye last night.\" He changed the subject quickly. \"Wonder how I'll look in G. I. Cloth?\" Page  \"You'll look beautiful. Just beautiful? Mrs. Leeder said. They both laughed a little. Then, noticing the sudden activity, they both glanced at the clock. ?It's time, Mother,\" he said. She put out a hand, then quickly drew it back. Already he was standing, his suitcase in his hand. \"No, Mother?don't get up?and don't come out to the train. I'd like it best this way.\" With one fleeting look at her he dashed through the door that led to the trains. Mrs. Leeder's glance followed him until he was lost in the crowd. She sat still on the long bench. It was funny how all alone she felt with so many people around her. At the other end of the room she could see Mrs. Chambers sobbing in Fred's arms. Fred was using his handkerchief on his own eyes, then they went out to the train. After a while, Mrs. Leeder stood up and went out the entrance toward home. Well, anyway, she hadn't cried. She had promised herself she wouldn't cry. But now she could let down if she wanted to. Funny she didn't, seem to be able to shed tears. It had all turned out so differently from the way she had expected. She was sure Jimmy had acted unnatural. He had kept that old suitcase between them so she couldn't take his hand or get close to him. And he didn't kiss her goodbye, or even take her in his arms. A December snow was falling. She buttoned her coat more closely around her. A plate-glass door panel caught her reflection. She paused, then started on?came back and stood still, shoving her hands deep into her coat pockets and straightening her shoulders. Then, after a minute, she hurried on. The picture she had seen wasn't exactly pleasing. Certainly not anything like Mrs. Chambers. Jimmy had said, \"Clothes can do an awful lot.\" Jimmy hadn't wanted to join his friends. Could it be that he was? she wouldn't say it. Jimmy wasn't like that. And yet?something had been wrong. Suddenly she felt hollow inside, an emptiness which she couldn't shake off. That was it? of course it was. She had been so busy making a living for the two of them and getting Jimmy through school for the last five years she just hadn't taken time out to keep herself up. She hadn't been in a beauty shop for?well she couldn't remember. Oh dear! She had let Jimmy down, not purposely, but down, just the same. The wind blew little wisps of hair around her face, and suddenly it seemed colder. She buried her chin and nose down beneath her storm collar and hurried homeward. That's what she needed?home-home and a good cry.  IT was October and Mrs. Leeder entered the depot and walked over to the train schedule. Number Twenty-Six was due at nine o'clock. It was eight now. She stopped a redcap. \"Can you tell me when Number Twenty-Six comes in from San Francisco?\" she asked. \"Nine o'clock, Mam,\" he said. She thanked him and walked to the far end of the waiting room. She placed one foot slightly back of the other one and sat down gracefully. Martin leaned back, she thought, always keep the back perfectly straight, shoulders relaxed. One of the beauty lessons had said, \"Always choose chairs with a firm seat, or the knees might collide with the chin.\" Well, this seat was firm enough, and it was on this same seat that a mother had said goodbye to her son last December. And now, after almost a year, she was here to meet him, with one hour to wait.\nYes, she had been the mother, but a very different one. That mother wore a coat that slapped her legs too far below the knees; had straight hair pinned in a tight knot at the back of her neck, and broken nails; she had also had the analgesic not to wear a hat or gloves.\nShe recalled words from lesson twenty-seven: \"Street clothes should be chosen with utmost care. Suits are best, and careful attention must be paid to accessories.\"\nA little smile played about her lips as she slowly and nonchalantly tugged at the glove on her left hand. She removed only one. She wanted to admire again her long lacquered nails. Leisurely she worked the fingers back into the soft kid. Underneath her tailored suit her heart was racing. She glanced at the clock. Forty-five more minutes to wait for Jimmy. Would he like her? He'd be surprised, she knew. Maybe he wouldn't know her with her? He'd be surprised, she knew. hat with bright feathers right smack on the top. She was all of an inch taller in these new shoes, too.\nPretty minutes to go!\nShe just couldn't sit there that long, she'd have to move about. The place hadn't changed much in a year?the same clanging of trains and the same calling of trains, except that now the voice came from a loudspeaker overhead. Everywhere, boys in khaki and blue rushed in to buy magazines, candy, and postcards, then dashed out to get on their trains.\nMrs. Leeder found herself moving with them out to the platform. Soon a long train slowed to a stop. She noticed a neatly dressed woman in a fur coat and red-feathered hat glancing anxiously up and down; white dozens of men in uniform spilled out of the cars. A smooth-faced sailor with a cane and a slight limp detached himself from the crowd and hurried toward the woman. \"Mother!\" he exclaimed, \"I hardly knew you.\" He clasped her in his arms.\n\"Boy?your coat. Mother, can you still afford mink with a war going on?\" He laughed and patted her arm. \"But I love you anyway. Mother. Gosh, is this black hair a wig, or does it wash out? I liked your hair with gray in it. But of course you are glamorous.\" He squeezed her again and guided her laughingly through the crowd. Mrs. Leeder watched them disappear.\nFinally she came to the end of the platform and automatically turned and started walking back. She thought she knew what the boy had meant when he had referred to his mother's mink coat. He had tried to laugh it off but he hadn't liked her hair, either. It was awfully black for such a wrinkled face. Mrs. Leeder guessed the boys liked to find things the same when they came back from the war. And now she was glad she hadn't rearranged the furniture or moved the rose garden. And jolly well glad she was that she didn't have a new fur coat to plague her. Yes, she felt cozy in the thought that Jim would find everything about the same. The same? She ran her gloved hand up the back of her neck. Those loose locks on an up-sweep were so annoying! Up-sweep! And her hat was a monstrosity, so her boss had said. But then, men didn't know anything about women's hats. But it was more than that. Her nails were so long she'd given up playing the piano months ago. Mrs. Leeders' heart did a drop act. She ran inside and looked at the clock. Eighteen minutes to go. Like one pursued, she ran to the ladies' lounge. Behind a screen she found a dressing table and a chair. Frantically she tore off her hat,\"\" pulled out combs from her hair. A big black face appeared around the screen. \"Ah's Mandy,\" it said. \"You all seemed in such a powah-ful hurry. Cain I do somp'in foah you all?\" Mrs. Leeder's heart came back into place for the first time in minutes. \"Oh, Mandy,\" she exclaimed, \"Never again will I doubt that prayers are answered. If you can lengthen this skirt two inches in ten minutes, you can name your price. Just baste it in, of course.\" Mrs. Leeder was already slipping it off. \"Ah'11 be right back, quick as scat,\" Mandy said, and left with the skirt over her arm. Mrs. Leeder studied herself for a second in the mirror. She hurriedly wiped off the heavy print of lipstick, leaving just enough, then turned her attention to her hair. She ran her comb through it several times, until it fell glistening to her shoulders. Then deftly she pushed the soft waves loosely around her face and wound the length into a low bob on her neck. Then, with a nail file she set to work on her nails. Surely, swiftly, in no time at all, she had filed away the sharp claws, rounding the ends and smoothing them off. \"Heah's you' skirt. Ma'am, and right on de dot a ten minutes,\" Mandy said, holding the skirt toward her. \"Oh, thanks. Thanks, Mandy,\" Mrs. Leeder said, \"help me pull it on, will you? It can't go on over my head, or my hair will be mussed. There. I'll fasten it. Run, see the time, please,\" slipping her a quarter. Mrs. Leeder finished dressing and hurried out to the platform, and stood among others who were waiting. From far away came the long, lonesome whistle of Number Twenty-Six. Everyone suddenly stood at attention, looking down the long track to where it curved out of sight. Mrs. Leeder thought, it won't be long now. Her stomach did a flip-flop. Again the whistle gave vent to two longs, one short, and a long, and soon the train came in, its engine puffing and panting. Mrs. Leeder's feet seemed glued to the platform. How could anyone see all the cars at once? She decided to stand in one place, near the main entrance. Then, if she didn't see Jimmy, he would see her after the crowd had thinned out.\nBut after a little while when the crowd had thinned out, and still no Jimmy, Mrs. Leeder grew anxious. Could it be that Jimmy had missed his train? There was another one due from the Coast in about nine minutes. But the telegram had said he would be on Number Twenty-Six.\nThere were two soldiers standing a little way down the platform. Maybe they could tell her something, she thought, as she started over to where they stood. One was bareheaded, and wearing dark glasses.\nThey were looking at her now and walking toward her.\n\"Why?that boy's hair is like Jimmy's!\" she thought, but he didn't look like?yes, he did. It was the dark glasses that had puzzled her. It was funny!?Oh, Jimmy?Jimmy couldn't see. Her fast strides broke into a run, and then her arms were about him, holding him tight, tight.\nShe wanted to say so many things. She wanted to tell him it didn't matter. But not a sound would come for years. She just could only press them tight together and pray for it it had been important that she keep from crying when he went away, it was doubly so now.\nShe felt his fingers exploring her face, then her hair, and the loose softness must have confused him?then crinkly the eager fingers sought and found the low bob at the back of her neck. A smile relieved the sternness of his mouth. \"It's all right, Lieutenant,\" he said, turning to the soldier. \"This is my mother. Thanks for standing by me.\" He held out his hand and the Lieutenant shook it warmly, lifted his cap to Mrs. Leeder, then hastily left them.\nGuiding Jimmy carefully through the station, she called a cab and they got in.\n\"That was Lieutenant Conrey. He's swell. On the train I told him about you. I said, 'You'll know my mother. She maybe won't be wearing a hat or gloves, and she combs her hair awful plain and wears it in a little knot on the back of her head.' Gosh, Mother, he knew you right off?\"\nMrs. Leeder leaned over and laid her cheek against his.\n\"Oh, Jimmy,\" she said. DESERT BORN Beatrice Knowlton Ekman Above a dark fir wood in Oregon, A yellow-lantern moon is hanging low; The deep, still waters to the ocean run, Their waters dimpling in the silver glow. To one remembering moon-drenched desert range, This forest land is beautiful.... But strange. Sixt Years J4go Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, September 1, and September 15, 1885 \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women OF All Nations\" Home: It has been very wisely remarked that in order to fully appreciate the blessings and comforts of life, it is necessary for a person to be described of them for a time. Who can so much appreciate the cheerful home fireside, the association with parents and friends, as those who have been separated from them for a season, and called to face the hard, cruel world alone, away from the kind, cheerful faces and helping hands of the loved ones? Home is the haven of rest to which we flee when the day's work is done What is so cheerful a sight as to see fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters surrounding the bright and cheerful hearth, each happy in the other's love, and all contented with their lot.... Where there is disorder and confusion the spirit of God cannot abide.... It is said, and reason and reflection corroborate the statement, that \"order is heaven's first law.\" So also should it be the first law of the home. Note: With a tender remembrance of that magnificent woman Helen Hunt Jackson, of Colorado Springs, we record her demise.... Mrs. Jackson wrote over the signature of H. H. And is widely known as a journalist of rare merit. Her last book is entitled \"Ramona\" and has been spoken of by critics and reviewers as the best novel by an American woman,... During her two visits in this city we had many interesting conversations, and she expressed herself always as intensely interested in all religions, especially anything new or original and when it most concerned women. Excerpts from a letter written from Almo, Cassia County, Idaho, by Hannah T. King: I have a few words to say about this remote region.... First, it is a wild but beautiful country, the atmosphere seems the very breath of heaven; so clear, pure, cool and invigorating, even in these dog days! The inhabitants are so widely separated, that nothing but love and joy are exhibited when they meet;... The spirit of the place breathes of peace and goodwill. Freedom and liberty reign supreme.... On Thursday I attended the first Relief Society held in this region.... There was a sweet, even childlike spirit in that first meeting! Each felt desirous to do her part, yet felt her inefficiency to carry out the desires of her heart; but everyone must have realized the Spirit of God was in that meeting. Don't we look back, as we ascend, Over the journey clear to the end? Cannot we see, though our eyes are dim, All of the past unknown to them?, Cannot we feel we are drawing near Those who are gone to the higher sphere? Nearer the treasures we lost long ago? They are above, and not below. ?E. Stephens Music: There is great power in music! Among the fine arts this has the strongest effect upon human character.... Who has not had his heart melted into tenderness and the fountain of his tears broken up by some touching appeal of melody.... And at church, what will concentrate the minds of the audience on God more than a beautiful hymn or anthem? Page 534 Woman's Sphere Ramona W.

DESLA BENNION of Spokane, Washington, formerly Edna Hull of Salt Lake City, has been elected to membership on the city school board. A Spokane newspaper points out that she was sponsored by the women of the University, of the Rotary Club, and of the Parent-Teachers Association; that she is the mother of five children, granddaughter of a Mormon woman who pushed a handcart all the way across the plains, and wife of a former Latter-day Saint mission president. In her campaign speeches Mrs. Bennion used her experience in recreational and other Church activities as a talking point. FILIPINO women were the first orientals to win suffrage. Mrs. Pilar H. Lim, a former president of the Philippine Federation of Women's Clubs, was largely responsible for this and many other achievements, such as higher literacy, lower mortality rate, diet clinics and factory nurseries for working mothers.

Page 535 EDITORIAL VOL. 32 SEPTEMBER 1945 NO. 9 Regular Weekly Relief Society Meetings Begin for 1945-46 Season \nTHE month of October marks the beginning of regular weekly Relief Society meetings for the 1945-46 season. Beginnings are always interesting. They represent a space or period of time at which action is taken in the fulfillment of dreams or in the realization of plans, many of which have been long in the making. Beginnings are accompanied by all sorts of reactions on the part of persons identified with them. Some approach them with enthusiasm, full of faith in that which has been initiated, and determined that the outcome will be successful and glorious. Others are skeptical, approaching them with doubt and criticism, seeing errors in judgment, weakness in plans, and insurmountable obstacles in the way of fulfillment. Still others are passive or indifferent toward beginnings, taking them much for granted and little concerned with their own responsibility toward that which has been started.\nOne cannot always judge the outcome of a beginning by its auspiciousness. Often beginnings which to all but a few seem of little import are proved by time to be of greatest moment, defining objectives, introducing activities, setting patterns that touch the lives of tens of thousands and that exert a profound influence in the forward march of society. Such was the case 103 years ago when eighteen Latter-day Saint women were organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith \"under the Priesthood and after the pattern of the Priesthood\" to \"look to the wants of the poor, search after objects of charity, and administer to their wants, ... to assist by correcting the morals and strengthening the virtues of the community.\" These sisters were early taught the proper relationship to their husbands, and their position in the home was an integral part of gospel teachings.\nWomen, young and mature, were quickly drawn toward the new institution. Forty-four new members came into the Society at the second meeting. Something had been initiated that appealed to all."

The objective as set forth by the Prophet will be adhered to carefully, adapted to present-day conditions and in line with present-day Church procedures.\nWelfare work will receive a great deal of our time, with full support being given to the Church Welfare Plan. Concern for neighbors will be emphasized. Page 536 EDITORIAL 537 WE must \"cherish\" one another, and graciously and willingly render service that will bring comfort and happiness into the lives of one another. Homemaking, too, will receive special emphasis during the coming season. It is the duty of Relief Society to train women to be skilled housekeepers and good homemakers. Attendance at Relief Society should give women an enlarged vision of the importance of maintaining their homes according to Latter-day Saint standards. Officers are urged to enlist young women as members of the Society, and to interpret and conduct the program so that it will attract them and meet their needs. The Latter-day Saint viewpoint and the spirit of the gospel should characterize all that is done in Relief Society, and the testimony of the truth of the restored gospel should be strengthened in every woman attending. Let us each resolve to be among those who approach the beginning of this season's work with enthusiasm, full of faith in that which has been initiated, and determined that the outcome of the year's work will be successful and glorious. -B. S. S. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES \"Other misfortunes may be borne, or their effects overcome. If disastrous wars should sweep our commerce from the ocean, another generation may renew it; if it exhaust our treasury, future industry may replenish it; if it desolate and lay waste our fields, still, under a new cultivation, they will grow green again, and ripen to future harvests. \"It were but a trifle even if the walls of yonder Capitol were to crumble, if its lofty pillars should fall, and its gorgeous decorations be all covered by the dust of the valley. All these may be rebuilt. \"But who shall reconstruct the fabric oi demolished government? \"Who shall rear again the well-proportioned columns of constitutional liberty? \"Who shall frame together the skillful architecture which unites national sovereignty with State rights, individual security, and public prosperity? \"No, if these columns fall, they will be raised not again. Like the Coliseum and the Parthenon, they will be destined to a mournful and a melancholy immortality. Bitterer tears, however, will flow over them than were ever shed over the monuments of Roman or Grecian art; for they will be the monuments of a more glorious edifice than Greece or Rome ever saw, the edifice of constitutional American liberty.\" ?Daniel Webster, \"Eulogy on General Washington,\" (1832). Notes TO THE FIELD Auxiliary Regional Meetings and Monthly Union Meetings Authorized COPIES of the following letter \"Further Instructions Regarding Conventions and Union Meetings\" over the signature of the First Presidency of the Church were mailed to Relief Society stake presidents. It is reprinted herewith for the information of Relief Society officers: July 16, 1945 To Church Officers, Dear Brethren and Sisters: Further Instructions Regarding Conventions and Union Meetings Because of limitations set on automotive travel, the General Church Authorities on January 17, 1942, speaking through the First Presidency, advised General Boards of Auxiliary Organizations to discontinue the holding of monthly Union meetings, Institutes, and Conventions. Later, the Government itself placed a limitation upon assemblies throughout the entire country. The suspension of Unions and Conventions, of course, made less effective direct contact of Stake Boards as such with wards and branch officers and teachers, but placed greater responsibility upon the ward and branch organizations. We commend the local officers and teachers upon their willingness, ability, and increased effort to guide and instruct the members of their respective organizations during this Page 538 critical war-time period. It is gratifying, indeed, to note how efficiently the quorums and auxiliary organizations have functioned notwithstanding the limitations and difficulties under which they have had to labor. Occasional visits by General Board members to wards, stakes and districts requesting special help have contributed to increased efficiency in class work and in general spiritual uplift. A recent ruling by the Office of Price Administration, increasing the amount of gasoline for \"A\" coupons seems to point to such a relaxation with regard to the use of gasoline as will permit additional travel. Accordingly, we now authorize the holding of monthly priesthood leadership meetings that may include quorum members who may be especially invited to attend these meetings, monthly priesthood meetings, auxiliary regional meetings, and monthly union meetings where any such meetings may be held without violating the restrictions regarding the use of gasoline and rubber, and where the holding of such meetings will not interfere with quarterly conferences or other regularly established meetings. However, we do not, by these amended instructions, intend to authorize nor to countenance the holding of any of these meetings under circumstances which involve the violation of governmental rules and regulations regarding travel either by automobile or otherwise. NOTES TO THE FIELD 539 In this connection, we point out that experiences during the exigencies of war indicate that the visits of stake board members to wards produce even better results than having local officers and teachers travel to a central place for a monthly union meeting. Youth Need Guidance And Supervision In moving thus early to lift the ban hitherto placed upon the holding of Conventions and Union meetings, we are obedient to the necessity for close cooperation and personal contact between general and stake officers, and the young people of the Church. Every means that will foster such association must be made available wherever and whenever possible. The proper guidance of our children and youth is one of our paramount responsibilities. We are looking to those who represent the General Authorities in Priesthood and in Auxiliary work to discharge this responsibility in sincerity and prayerful devotion. Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence. He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand. Even so. Amen. Sincerely your brethren, George Albert Smith J. Reuben Clark, Jr. David O. McKay The First Presidency Ward Relief Society Conferences, November 4, 1945 CONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on Fast Sunday evenings, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evenings of Fast Day in November and March. Fast Day in November this year will occur November 4, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the annual ward Relief Society conference. Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of Fast Day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society conference, coming as it does only one month after the opening of the regular weekly meetings in October, thus affording opportunity for previewing the lessons and other work, near the beginning of the educational season. It is recommended: 1. That each ward conference be attended by a representative of the stake board who should be present at both the officers' meeting and the general session. 2. That each conference consist of  two meetings? a. An officers' meeting to be attended by the ward executive officers, special workers and class leaders, the ward bishop or his representative, and the visiting stake board member.\nb. A general session for all Relief Society members and for the general membership of the ward.\nThe purposes of the officers' meeting are to discuss special problems confronting the ward Relief Society, and to provide opportunity for the stake board member to evaluate the condition of the ward Society and to advise, instruct, and stimulate the ward officers. In order to accomplish the purposes of the meeting, some stakes prepare a questionnaire or present and discuss data from the last annual report. At least one hour should be allowed for this meeting and, in some instances, a longer period may be required. The time for holding the officers' meeting is optional with wards, but should be at a time convenient for the visiting stake board member and bishop. For example, this meeting may be held immediately preceding the general session, as heretofore\nsuggested, the previous evening, or at some other time convenient for the bishop and visiting board member. This officers' meeting, held in connection with the ward conference, may constitute the monthly ward preparation meeting for the month in which the conference is held.\nIn order to insure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that advance announcement of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members particularly should be urged to attend.\nA suggestive program for use at ward conference will be sent to ward and stake presidents in bulletin form. Its use is optional and stakes and wards desiring to plan their own programs may do so. However, the General Board is very anxious that this meeting be used to acquaint ward members with the work of Relief Society and also with a view to enlisting the active participation of the women of the ward. TODAY Dorothy Mae Halls This moment was created for happiness. And now is the time to feel gay. If happiness be postponed till tomorrow. What shall I do with today? The breath of life must be breathed today, Or breathed it will never be; Tomorrow is always just out of my grasp, Today is confronting me. Beyond This Dorothy Clapp Rohinson THE car was cruising effortlessly. It was a rare morning and a rare scene. Peaks of mountains and barbs of lava etched jagged holes through a downy quilt of shifting rain clouds. The scent of wet earth and green sage crept through the open window. In the back seat Mary Evans quivered with nostalgia. \"It's camouflage,? she whispered to herself. \"Cruel, selfish camouflage.\" The desert stretched before them with blue mountains for a backdrop. The soft rain came, then passed and came again. Quiescent, the mood of the travelers softened. Only Mary stiffened. '*We should be home by five o'clock.\" Home. These carefree people, Mr. McCollum, his wife and daughter, Patricia, would be home. Mary no longer had a home. Home meant a family and love and dreams. It meant building for the future. Her future lay behind. A roaring filled the sky. Between cloud puffs three bombers appeared flying in formation. The car stopped while the driver watched. \"That's the life,\" he sighed. \"Those kids are lucky.\" \"Lucky.\" Mary spat the word. The girl beside her laid a hand gently on her knee but Mary moved. The hand was withdrawn. To these people war meant honor and glory. It even made them kind to their seamstress. They had brought her on this trip thinking it would make her forget. As if there were such a thing as forgetting. A quick smothered sob made her turn quickly, but Patricia's face was turned away. Gene had been the son every mother thinks she has. Strong, rugged, yet as full of dreams as a girl. \"Don't you worry. Mom,\" he had said so many times. \"Some day people are going to point to you and say, 'Know what? That's Gene Evan's mother. And you will swell with pride and I will tell the whole world the kind of mother you have been. And I'll pay the mortgage and buy new furniture. How's that?\" \"Perfect.\" Mary never doubted he would do just that. Gene had what it took to make dreams come true. The bombers passed and the car started again. Mary stared unseeing at the rocks and brush. It was such a little way back to his boyhood. \"Know what?\" he had asked once in a burst of confidence. He had finished mowing McCollum's lawn and they were sitting on their own back steps. The softness of a spring evening filled the dusk about them. \"No. What?\" \"Some day after I go away and make my fortune, I'll come winging back out of the clouds in a big shining ship. I'll set her down over there on that vacant lot and everybody will come running to see. Page  Pat will be there, too. I'll be big then and strong, and I will pick her up in my arms and while everybody is watching we will fly away into the? into the land of Shining Mountains. DREAMS. Sweet dreams of youth. Their ending was of the essence of their birth. He had gone winging into the Shining Mountains, but Patricia was here and all the dreams had been for nothing. Mary had tried desperately to make the years less hard. Her efforts had been but fumbling beside the directness of his purpose. He had grown tall, hard of muscle and keen of eye. Handsome fellow, people said, and drew their daughters away. He would be like his dad. Mary knew better. From first grade on he'd had eyes for one girl only, Patricia McCollum, the untouchable. But his pride was as fierce as his strength. Mary glanced briefly at the girl, then looked again. She was staring ahead, her face a study in alabaster, hands motionless in her lap. Compelled by Mary's gaze she turned. Her mind came back slowly from long distances. There was something baffling in her eyes. Was it pity. Mary would have no pity. For herself or Gene. Oh, especially not for Gene. How he had managed flying lessons she never knew. It seemed impossible to add one more hour to his day. But he had. Then those flying lessons had suddenly become the important thing in his life?in all life. At twenty-one he had put aside the dreams of youth for the grim business of war. Mary tried to shut her mind to that first parting. He had stood on the back porch a long time staring in the direction of the imposing McCollum home, but he left without going over. Patricia had come the next day and if her eyes were bleak with sympathy, well, Mary's were bleak, too. She was left with only memories. The car picked up speed. The landscape became wilder, more stark. Was it like this in Greenland, she wondered? He'd been there the last year. He had written so few details. Don't worry, Mom. Our huts are warm, and we can take it. I am getting a leave the next time we hit the mainland. I hope it will be soon. There is nothing in all the world like the feel of good old U. S. Soil under a punk's feet. Nothing unless it is the sight of his Mom or his best girl. I'll come winging out of the clouds as I promised. And I am getting Pat this trip. Do you think she will spare me a week? I have learned basic values up here, and I am going to tell her what I should have told her long ago. But he hadn't asked Patricia to spare a week from her busy comfortable life. He had never whispered the wild sweet love that had been his secret dream through the years. In quick thought Mary turned, and wondered at the nakedness of the girl's face. Why?why it hadn't been pity. Patricia had been in love with him. She would have gone winging with him into the unknown. That explained so many little things. Mary sickened a little. The knowledge would have meant so much to Gene. It would have meant fulfilment to him. Now he would never know?or had he known? Of course. That. Explained what he had said about basic values. Her lips set stubbornly. Patricia had never known want or an unfulfilled desire. Let her suffer as Gene had suffered. In all her life Mary had had just her son. She was not sharing him now.\nShe had worked night and day to prepare for his coming. Her few carefully hoarded dollars had gone for paint and wallpaper. The money he sent home she was saving for him. She had changed her bed to his room. Maybe he would not recognize it under its coat of paint. She wanted him to have the best of everything.\nAnd then?and then the very day he was to have arrived there came a cablegram instead. \"Lost in performance of duty.\" A month?a long, long month?during which Patricia had stood by, white-faced, tight-lipped. How blinded Mary had been by her own suffering. A moment ended by a letter. His plane had been found. He and all his crew had been buried at an advance base, whatever that meant.\nYes, after all Mary did know what it meant. It meant empty, desolate years. It meant the end of the world. It meant the end of planning?and that Patricia would never know.\nThe rain clouds lifted and the rocks grew hot. They stopped at the Craters of the Moon. It had been very kind of the McCollums to bring her on this trip but she wished they would not stop so often. She watched impatiently while the driver paid an entrance fee and received instructions. More impatiently she saw him turn the car onto a road where no road should ever be. It lead into lava flows once spewed white-hot from a dragon's\nmouth. Immediately her impatience vanished. For the first time in months she was interested. The bleakness and blackness found echo in her heart.\nWeird, uncanny formations, terrifying in their stark nakedness, were sharply etched, as yet untouched by the raging power of time and the elements. Rising from the confusion, were several sharply sloping cones of coal-black pulverized cinders.\nSomething was rising unbidden in Mary. Something akin to justification. How like LIFE this barren waste was, bleak, impotent and utterly without form or purpose. Of no earthly use to God or man.\nThey rounded a quick turn and stopped abruptly. Leaving the car they stood at the edge of the road gazing in awe and bewilderment.\nHEAVEN had laid a fleece of beauty over stark sterility. Every slope of every black hill was covered with a carpet of flowers. Wild snowballs, Gene had called them. From between two slender silver leaves a stem rose, topped by a snowball the size of a large marble. The balls graduated in color from pale canary through orange, to crimson.\nUnbelievably, there was a tiny orchard of these among them. A Heaven by Gardener not only had planted, but had spaced them. Looking from any direction there were perfect rows with plants four inches apart. Silver, yellow, orchid, crimson, and, underneath, the rimming black lace of cinders. It was a miracle. The ash of black despair had given birth to HOPE, beautiful beyond compare.\nAt Patricia's gasp, Mary turned to face her. Tears were streaming unheeded down the girl's cheeks. This was the girl Gene had loved, who loved him; and there must be no despair. Patricia's must not be denied her. Mary took the girl's hand. \"He meant to tell you,\" she whispered. \"That is why he was coming home.\""

            "content": "today as one of the most outstanding women of her century. This recognition came to her because of the great work she accomplished in forwarding the cause of woman suffrage in America. For forty-eight years she devoted herself to this great movement, traveling throughout the country, speaking, lecturing, debating, and organizing the women into working units. She even swept halls, carried chairs and benches, bought and placed candles for lighting, and then did the speaking. She also traveled in Europe, discussing woman suffrage with noted men and women in both England and Germany.\nShe was associated in this pioneer movement with a number of forward-looking leaders, but there were three who stood closest to her and gave the greatest support. They were Elizabeth Cady Stanton who was known as the true mother of woman suffrage in the United States?for that matter in the world, organizing as she did the first Woman's Rights Convention in the world, at Seneca Falls in 1848; Lucretia Mott, the\neloquent Quaker preacher and anti-slavery leader; and Lucy Stone, social reformer, who stood and worked for all types of social betterment, and who, after graduation from college, a rare privilege for women in those days, decided that she would dedicate her life to make life easier and better for women. These four leaders were called the Big Four, and the Four Giants of the early suffrage movement, but Susan B. Anthony carried the major part of the burden and was known throughout the nation as the greatest and mightiest warrior for women.\nOne who wrote her life says:\nEvery girl who now enjoys a college education; every woman who earns a living in any profession or trade; every wife who is protected in the property which she owns; every mother who has an equal right with the father to the custody and control of her children; every woman who belongs to a club and works for individual and civic improvement; every woman who is privileged to vote owes these sacred privileges to Susan B. Anthony above all others.\nMiss Anthony did not live to see the fulfillment of her dream, which was full suffrage for women, but her spirit ever carried on as a guide and inspiration to her successors. She passed away in 1906 at the age of eighty-six, fourteen years before the crest of victory?the passage and ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which occurred in 1920 and which gave the vote to women.\nSusan B. Anthony was fortunate in her heritage, background, and early training. Page 519 GROUP OF NATIONAL AND LATTER-DAY SAINT SUFFRAGE LEADERS, 1895 Lower row, left to right: President Zina D. H.

Caine, Electa Bullock, Dr. Mattie Hughes Cannon, Phebe Y. Beattie, Emily S. Richards, Emmeline B. Wells, Rebecca E. Little, Augusta W. Grant. Born in a Quaker home, she was reared in an atmosphere of freedom, independence, and moral zeal. She was a precocious child, learning to read at the age of three. She had an unusual memory, an inquisitive mind, and a great desire for learning. She had fair opportunity for schooling as the elementary schools of the Quakers were open to girls as well as boys. Then there was a period of training at a female seminary in Pennsylvania where she prepared to be a teacher. With her sisters she was encouraged by her father to be industrious, to find a gainful occupation, and to strive for independence. For one who was in later life to champion humanitarian causes, including the rights of women, she was fortunate in being a member of the society of Friends which gave unusual opportunities for women members. From the very beginning the Quakers had given women an equal place with men in their church services and their church government. Women were permitted to speak in church whenever they felt inclined to do so, and some even rose to the dignity of regular preachers. It was only natural, therefore, that this church furnished many of the early American women leaders who worked for temperance, anti-slavery, equal rights, and suffrage. Miss Anthony began her public career at the age of seventeen as a school teacher in Conajoharie, New York. SUSAN B. ANTHONY 521 She was happy and successful in her work, but she was not satisfied to confine her interests and activities entirely to the schoolroom. She was intelligent, well-read, a careful thinker, had great power as an executive and organizer. She was public spirited and she felt the urge to widen her horizon and enlarge her field of effort. She was interested in all the public questions of her day, and set out to tackle some of the social and economic problems. She insisted that women felt the same call to serve and help with the world's work as men, and might prove as able. She even advanced the revolutionary idea that women were the social and intellectual equals of men, for which she received caustic criticism. \"PROM the days of her childhood she had abhorred human slavery, as did her Quaker father before her. So opposed to slavery was Daniel Anthony that he went to great pains to try to get cotton for his cotton mills which did not have the taint of slave labor. The temperance movement also early claimed Susan's attention and support. So vigorous was she in these two great causes that she was known as a militant abolitionist and a valiant advocate of temperance. In 1852, when she went as a delegate to a joint meeting of the Sons and Daughters of Temperance in Albany, New York, and arose to speak to a motion, she was quickly told that women were not invited to speak, but to listen and learn. In 1853, she attended a teachers' convention at Rochester, N. Y. After listening for hours to a dull discussion on the subject of teaching, she arose and asked permission to speak. The chairman, astounded and perplexed, asked for the pleasure of the convention, and after a one-half hour's discussion and a vote, it was decided by a small majority that she might speak. She attended many public meetings and conventions and when men hoped that she would be silent, she insisted on being heard. Before long Miss Anthony found herself fighting other social evils, in addition to slavery and the evils of drinking, such as low wages for women, the lack of opportunity for higher education and professional training for women, lack of opportunity for holding office in volunteer organizations, and restrictions which kept women from being on an equal plane with men before the law. Like other women reformers. Miss Anthony sensed her limitations. She felt continually handicapped on every side and wondered what could best be done to give women more influence in human affairs. She realized, too, that to attack specific evils and injustices one by one was a slow process. She became convinced that women should work for total freedom. It was at this time (1852) that she became converted to and joined the Woman's Rights Movement, which program included suffrage, and which she was destined to lead. After long years of effort, the Federal Amendment to"

Now, often, when I hear men speak Of places they hold dear. In various portions of the earth, Both very far, and near. In memory my thoughts return And I can plainly see That wandering lane in Idaho, The little house and tree. Nellie O. Parker Former Member Relief Society General Board The little house and tree. Planning For Safety THE great number of accidents occurring in the homes of America has intensified research into their causes. It has been found that many accidents are due to faulty home design, unsafe equipment, and careless actions. If the greatest degree of safety is to be obtained, careful consideration must be given to the elimination of hazards which are known to produce accidents. This may require changes in the house plan, rearrangement of the. Furniture, provision of places for putting things away, or the addition of more light to entrances, passages, and stairways. The National Safety Council tells us that falls cause about two-thirds of all home tragedies. All stairs should have an easy ascent with equal step heights or rises and treads of equal width. Sturdy hand rails should be provided. Good lighting is essential and may be secured by placing a switch at both the top and the bottom of the stairs. There should be non-slip floor surfaces and well-secured carpeting. Loose metal step guards or small throw rugs are malicious hazards. Rooms with floor levels of varying heights?a step up to the dining room or one down to the living room?are a constant danger. Any door opening into a hall should swing roomward and should not open directly on a down stairway. If this arrangement cannot be avoided, a safety lock should be placed on the door to give time for realization of a potential fall. Overhead obstructions should be removed or painted white, especially in the basement and attic stairways. Top and bottom steps, when painted white, will indicate when the end is reached. A gate to bar the stairs is essential if there are toddlers around. The bathroom is often the scene of falls, scalds, and burns if the equipment is not arranged to prevent them. The tub should have a flat bottom with at least one strong, solid grip on the wall to hold on to when getting in and out of the tub or shower. There should be a non-slip mat on the floor and a good container should be provided to keep soap out of the way. The water should be kept below scalding, about 125? Fahrenheit. Records tell of fatal results to children from too hot water being turned on them. Electric switches should be placed outside the bathroom or beyond reach of the tub or shower. Never touch an electrical appliance with wet hands. Many older people, as well as children, die from falls and burns in bedrooms. There should be light fixtures at both doors and bedsides. See that there is a straight path from the bed to the door to avoid bumping or falling over furniture. Children should be provided with safe cribs having the slats close enough to prevent the baby's head Page  being caught between them. Be sure that children's furniture and toys are painted with non-poisonous compounds. Reliable dealers should know the ingredients of their paints. Radiant heaters should be placed away from materials that could be ignited, and heating pads should be placed away from materials that could be ignited, and heating pads should be kept in good repair to prevent burns.\nWindows need careful consideration. If they can be arranged to swing or turn in for cleaning, a very definite falling hazard will be eliminated, as sitting or leaning out of windows to wash them is dangerous. Screens and storm windows should be adjusted from the inside and the catches on all screens should be strong and secure.\nThe roof design of a home should be kept simple and the attic well insulated to eliminate the necessity of removing snow and ice from the eaves and gutters in heavy winter weather.\nMake the living room livable by grouping the furniture where it will be most used, leaving clear paths for family traffic. Provide enough electric plug-ins to eliminate the necessity for long cords which may be tripped over or broken. Sew weights or rubber fruit rings on the under side of rugs to keep them flat and secure them from slipping or tripping. Use non-skid wax on the floors.\nThe kitchen is the most dangerous room in the house. Children should be kept out while cooking or canning is going on. All equipment should be kept in good repair. Shelves should be placed within reach, or where this cannot be done, a sturdy stepladder with wide treads or \"step stool\" should be used. Stoves with an open flame should not be closer than twelve to eighteen inches from a window. Curtains should be securely fastened so they won't blow over the flame and ignite. All floors, walls, and chimneys should be properly insulated from heating stoves. Matches and all sharp instruments should be put away from little fingers.\nMore than half of the home accidents happen outside the home. Provide adequate light for porch steps and walks. If paths cannot be cleaned from snow and ice, they should be sprinkled with salt or ashes. Clean rain gutters will form fewer icicles. Clothes lines should be arranged higher than the head or placed out of the line of traffic.\nTake advantage of foresight and planning to prevent home tragedies. Good housekeeping is safe housekeeping.Therefore,... See that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again. For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored (Alma 41:14-15). His First Teacher Mildred Y. Hunt ONE of the ever-increasing wonders of my world is the capacity of the child mind for receiving impressions. In his quest for learning he is inexhaustible. In the beginning, his questions were very simple and the main problem was framing replies in language that he could understand. Day by day his interest has widened and with it my responsibility, for I must weave the type of fabric which I desire to be the basis of his future education. This is a part of motherhood in which I have always believed, but not until my own child reached this stage did its possibilities rise before me in such limitless proportions. The impressions made now, upon virgin soil, will take root and live to shape the conduct of his entire life. That which concerns me most at this stage is the foundation of religion. I feel certain that the responsibility for this belongs essentially to me, rather than to those who teach him outside of home. Their contribution will help, but mine is the task of building the main structure. Sunday School and Primary lessons will be more beneficial if he has a background of religious knowledge. It is well that repetition does not bore him, for each retelling strengthens his knowledge and widens his understanding. The characters of the Bible are real and interesting. He never tires of hearing about Jesus and all the incidents and happenings that bring out the beauty and purity of his life. Joseph Smith, too, lives for him in all his nobility. Adam, Enoch, and Noah, the stories of Joseph and the enslavement of the children of Israel, and their delivery by Moses are as interesting to him as any characters of fiction. This is the wonderful thing about teaching him, for once the child's interest is gained the teacher's work is easy and pleasurable. Our Church leaders have stressed the importance of early training for children. According to President Grant: The Lord has said that it is our duty to teach our children in their youth. Children are not born with a knowledge of the gospel. Each one must learn and study and gain that knowledge for himself. Brigham Young was very explicit in his direction to mothers: Let mothers commence to teach their children while in their laps; there do you teach them to love the Lord and keep his commandments.... If you, mothers, will live your religion, then in the love and fear of God teach your children constantly and thoroughly in the ways of life and salvation, training them up in the way they should go, and when they are old they will not depart from it. If we do not take the pains to train our children, to teach and \" instruct them concerning these revealed truths, the condemnation will be upon us as parents. Page 547 The value of family prayers in training children for religious and spiritual lives cannot be over estimated. Sincerity and humility on the part of the parents seeking the spirit of the Lord in the home is one of the first profound impressions to be made on young minds.\nIt is easy to let less important tasks crowd out these essential activities. One of the most potent weapons of the adversary is procrastination. Our lives today move at a rapid tempo, but it is more important than ever that we remain calm, and hold fast to the enduring and everlasting principles of the salvation of souls.\nfor us but also for our children. Not one of the tasks constantly tugging at us is important enough to justify neglect of the great trust which is ours in the training of these little ones.\nAnd so, of the two precious years that remain before I give him over to others to teach, there is no time to waste. In studying for the information which I must have in order to meet this goal, I, too, shall be immeasurably benefited. We shall share a rich and happy experience together which we shall be better able to give to others. MATES Edward R. Tuttle The fabric of their love was never one Of fragile texture, made with silken twine And weft of dreams that later might be done, Somehow, into a workable design; But, was the homespun of a pent-up street Where pain-worn dwellers scarcely knew the soil. Expectancy had seldom turned their feet From an accustomed rendezvous with toil. They had preferred to let a slower growth Mature the rugged fibers in their care, Until a loom of years could furnish both With proper raiment for enduring wear. The mute concessions of this man and wife Had given each the condiments of life. The Radiant Spirit A FANTASY Miranda Snow Walton IN the Beautiful Kingdom lay a broad, white roadway running like a pearled ribbon from the Mountain of the Great Throne to the Silver Sea. Many people, young and old, traveled along the Highway, for it was the Road of Life. This is a tale of two men who journeyed thereon.\nNow, there was a legend in the Beautiful Kingdom that when a man had traversed the Highway's length, even unto the shores of the Silver Sea, the Radiant One would take him by the hand, and lead him into an enchanted land, where his eyes would behold things too beautiful for mortal men to look upon. None had ever returned to tell of its wonder, for the law was that a traveler walked that way but once.\nIt was springtime when Jan and Justin began their pilgrimage. All the earth was made fair and lovely by the silvery sunshine that fell from happy skies. Birds and flowers grew in rich abundance, and birds' celestial music filled the air like a blessed benediction.\nJan was in ecstasy. Nothing, he thought, could be as beautiful as this; no, not even the vision of the Radiant One.\nEach day, each hour, brought new delight to his soul, and his feet tarried along the trail until Justin became impatient.\n\"Hurry,\" he would call to Jan,\n\"these are only flowers and trees and birds which we can see every day. Why linger among these common things? Let us not stop until we have reached the Silver Sea.\"\nHe would have hastened ahead, but he could not, for it had been decreed that they journey together. He complained bitterly when Jan delayed while they listened to the rustling of moonlit pines.\n\"Angel whispers, they are,\" he told Justin, but Justin could only hear the branches scraping one against the other, and he fretted to be on his way, until his heart became filled with worry and resentment.\nSummer came, and passed; then autumn and the earth was more beautiful than it had been in the springtime. To Jan, each scarlet leaf became a miracle, each golden tree more exquisite than the last, and where green fields had lain in lazy loveliness, now abundant harvests gave the promise of royal riches to all men. But Justin's impatience waxed more strong.\n\"The nights are becoming chill,\" he complained, \"it will soon be winter, and it is still a far journey to the Silver Sea.\"\n\"Yes, I know the nights are chill,\" said Jan, \"but the stars hang low and close like diamonds upon earth's pure breast, and I would drink of this beauty while I can, for we will pass this way but once.\" So they tarried until the winter of life was upon them, and their footsteps faltered many times, for their bodies were tired from their long journeying. They knew now that they would soon reach the Silver Sea, and Justin inlaid his companion bitterly.\n\"See,\" he said, \"you have wasted our strength and time along the way on transient trifles. Our eyes are dim with age. Tell me, how can we now see the Radiant One?\"\nAnd Jan replied, \"I am glad for the experiences of the springtime, for summer's clouds and showers, for the recompense of the harvest. These things have given me power to understand the immenity of that which is to come.\"\nThen the day came when they stepped beyond the sunset into the Silver Sea. With eager, expectant eyes they looked for the Radiant One, as the legend had told them.\nJustin spoke first. \"We are too late, or we have missed our way. This is only another sea, like the many we have passed, and I do not\nI see a person standing in the sun.\"\nBut Jan did not hear, for his ears were filled with the chant of angel choirs, his eyes were filled with the beauty that was too great for mortal man to look upon. His soul stood singing, for it knew the ecstasy of immortality, the glory and the joy of heavenly things, the wonder of eternity.\nThe Radiant One took him by the hand.\n\"Only those who have known me as they journeyed along the way of life can see me here. I walk with all men, but there are those who will not see and some who will not hear. Blessed are you, Jan, for you have seen me in the sunrise, and in the sacred silence of a higher noon; have known me when I manifested myself in acts of kindness by fellow travelers. You have felt my presence when life storms of the obscured your vision. I bless you, Jan, with eternal joy. I am the one whose mission it is to give happiness to men. I am the Spirit of Appreciation.\""

And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER IV SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, jilted by Hugh Temple who is serving in Australia, begins to take an interest in the children of Jeff Holden, widower principal of the school where Delsa teaches. The townsfolk, who do not know of Hugh's change of heart, think that Delsa is interested in Jeff, and condemn her for her infidelity to Hugh. THE girls came noisily into the house, shaking their long curls, waving letters in their hands, hugging big knitting bags close to their hearts. Delsa greeted them gaily, with the special little comment that each one merited. These were her chums and playmates since babyhood, they were as familiar to her as if they had belonged to her own family. She knew of their absent sweethearts, their hopes, their dreams and longings. There's something very special about a small town?especially a small Utah town, Delsa thought, with everyone belonging to the same Church, knowing everyone else. It was just like one big family. They settled down to the business of the evening at last. The girls got out their sewing or knitting or crocheting and went to work. And as the others worked, one would read her letters, or bits of them?the bits she cared to share?each girl taking a turn. Delsa sat back in a corner working on the exquisite tablecloth she was crocheting, thinking, I can't read them Hugh's letter?not a word of it. I would break down and cry if I did. And I can't lie to them and say I haven't heard from Hugh, for his mother knows I have?and by this time, probably, every one of them knows it, too. What shall I say? Shall I say, \"Well, girls, I am withdrawing from the War Widows! I no longer have a right to belong? I'm no longer engaged to Hugh Temple! Should I say that now and have it over with? Grace Metcalfe looked at Delsa's tablecloth and sniffed. \"You'll never get that done, Delsa Marriott,\" she said, \"if you don't hurry. I don't think it's grown a stitch since last meeting.*' Delsa made herself laugh. She was sure that Grace had heard that Hugh's mother was displeased at her going to Jeff Holden's every day. If nice little Millie Lewis had heard it, surely Grace, who missed nothing in the way of gossip, had heard, also. She was gently baiting Delsa, but Delsa was not going to be drawn into any discussion of her own affairs tonight. She made herself laugh brightly, and reply casually. Millie rushed to her rescue. \"Delsa's got a surprise for you all tonight,\" she cried. \"A big surprise!\" Delsa looked up at her friend in astonishment. Millie had asked her to keep it a secret. Lina caught her breath sharply. She, too, had been made to promise secrecy. But Millie giggled, and would say no more. Page  She had succeeded in diverting their attention. They began to tease Millie and Delsa to tell them what she had planned, and Delsa was thankful for the minutes wasted in this nonsense, as they delayed the moment when the girls would ask, \"And now, what did Hugh say in his last letter, Delsa?\" But the demand came at last and Delsa, scarcely knowing what words she would say, looked at her friends and told them, quietly, \"Hugh was lonely, girls. There isn't a word of his last letter that I can very well share with anyone. It was meant just for me?\" The girls murmured, \"Toor Hugh! Delsa, give us his last address and we'll all write to him! We'll cheer him up!\" And Delsa heard Hugh's mother sniffle a little in the background, trying to let Delsa know that she felt sorry for her son, away off in Australia, loving, trusting the girl back home. Delsa glanced at the clock. \"We'll have to have our refreshments now if we're going to be ready for the surprise,\" she said, and hurried out into the kitchen to prepare the cake and ice cream that was the standard party food. Her mother came to help her, but Hugh's mother moved on into the living room with the girls, tacitly taking her stand with them and Hugh and against Delsa. DELSA felt her lip curving in a bitter smile and shook her head angrily. Sour old maid, already! She thought, and you haven't even released Hugh yet. What will your lips look like ten years from now? They had scarcely finished the ice cream when they heard voices on the porch, and Jim Lewis burst into the room. \"Surprise! Surprise!\" giggled Millie, and Lina was in Jim's arms, radiant, \"Oh, Jim, I could hardly bear it, waiting for you to come!\" Now Delsa had no more fears for her own secret. Everyone was hugging Jim, pouring out eager questions, laughing. Relief was in their voices and their laughter?the same relief Delsa had felt when she had learned that Jim was home. Then she remembered Jim's buddy, and would have crowded past the little knot to make him welcome, but Jim saw her and went to her. \"How's Delsa?\" he asked, lifting her chin and kissing her lightly. \"Oh, Jim!\" she cried, and didn't mind the tears that blurred his familiar face. \"Jim, it's so good to see you. You look so well!\" \"I brought my buddy along,\" Jim found the chance to say. \"Back up, girls. I want you all to meet Alec Windsor. Alec, this is my sister's and Lina's crowd?shall I tell you their names now, or one by one, so you'll have half a chance to remember them?\" Delsa's eyes went to the dark figure now beside Jim. He was like Hugh? that same eager, slanting-in-to-the-wind look about him; the same dark eyes and hair lifting from a tanned forehead. She held out her hand. \"I'm Delsa Marriott,\" she said simply. \"I'm glad you could come with Jim.\" Alec took her hand and looked down into her eyes. \"Jim's told me about you?about AND FOR ETERNITY 553 all the girls here?I envied him. It was just as if he had a dozen or more sisters waiting here at home to make him happy. You look just as he said you would, Delsa.\" Jim, who had gone over to greet the two older women, now came and extricated Alec from the laughing girls, and took him across the room. Delsa, watching, could see how Hugh's mother stared at the boy's resemblance to her son; could see how she bent eagerly to welcome him; how she adopted Alec immediately. Her own mother said, '1 think there's a little ice cream left, if you boys would like a dish,\" and everyone roared with laughter. It was so like old times?like the high school days, when the same crowd of girls, calling themselves the Merry Old Maids, had met. When it was just about time for them to break up the party, all the boys their age?Hugh and Jim and Louis and the rest-would drop by to walk the girls home. And then Mrs. Marriott would say the same thing, \"There's a little ice cream left,\" and would feed the whole crowd again. JIM and Alec loved the ice cream \" and cake, and the two mothers beamed tenderly on them as they ate. Delsa thought, \"I didn't realize how much, how dreadfully much, they miss the boys, too!\" When they could eat no more, Jim looked longingly at the record player and said, ?I guess we couldn't have a dance or two, Delsa? I promise we'll not play favorites? but give you all a whirl, if you'll only let us. It's been so long since we had a real dance?\" \"Why, of course, Jim!\" Delsa cried. \"We'd love it! The old records need a little exercise?if they aren't dimmed with rust and dust from disuse.\" She selected one of the crowd's favorite discs and set it in place. The girls watched worshipfully as Jim put his arm about Lina and his cheek against her hair and started to dance. Alec went to Millie, and Delsa felt a strange ache in her heart as he began to circle the room with her chum. Delsa was changing the record when she felt Alec's tall form beside her. Her hands fumbled, and his firm brown fingers took the disc and placed it in position. He pressed the button and the record began to turn. \"Our dance?\" he said, and his arm went about her and she was dancing with him. Delsa's first thought was, it's heaven to be dancing again! Then she smiled to herself. She had danced many times since the boys left?danced with the men and the older school boys. But it wasn't the same. Alec had to bend his head to talk to her above the music, but he said, \"Tm glad that I could come with Jim. I'm going to have a good time, I can see that plainly. And I hope you'll help.\" \"Help?\" Delsa asked, her straying thoughts not catching his meaning. \"Yes!\" he grinned down at her. \"I'd like to,\" Delsa smiled, \"but I doubt if I'll get a chance. You'll have more girls wanting to help you have a good time than you'll need!\" \"But have you ever noticed,\" he asked seriously, \"that it isn't always the many that make the much?\" She looked up at him, baffled, and he laughed down at her.\n\"I've found that one companion?the right one?can do more towards providing a good time than any number of miscellaneous folks,\" he explained.\nThey danced in silence for a moment, and then Alec asked \"Do you have those here? But of course you do! Do you ride?\"\nWhen Delsa nodded he went on, \"Well then, I appoint you chief guide and pointer-outer to show me the wonders of this valley. Jim will have no time, what with a wedding and a bride to look after, so I'll be left high and dry unless you take care of me.\"\nDelsa smiled.\n\"Wait and see,\" she said.\nTheir dance over, Delsa sat beside Hugh's mother while the two boys danced with every girl in turn.\nDelsa and her voice troubled, \"Do you think he's like Hugh, Aunt Martha?\"\n\"A little,\" Hugh's mother said judiciously, \"only not nearly so good looking, of course, and not so tall. And his shoulders aren't broad like Hugh's?\"\nSuddenly Delsa felt the tension inside her dissolve and she smiled and gave Hugh's mother a quick, affectionate hug.\n\"That's just what I thought,\" she said.\nHugh's mother returned her friendliness. She patted Delsa's hand and said softly, \"Poor boy! I feel so sorry for him?no mother, no family, no town full of friends waiting for him. I can't help thinking how it must be with Hugh?away off there in Australia. He's a stranger here, just like Alec is here, Delsa,\nnot knowing anyone. I hope somebody is trying to make him happy.\"\nBitterness twisted Delsa's lips again, and she turned her head so that Hugh's mother wouldn't see it, as she answered, \"Someone is, Aunt Martha! Surely someone has taken Hugh under her wing!\"\nAt last the evening was over and the crowd was leaving. Jim and Alec and the girls said their goodbyes and went laughing out into the clear, cool night?Jim with Lina, of course, and Alec Windsor walking with Millie.\nDELSA stood in the open doorway, watching them go down the walk and turn into the road, going in different directions toward their homes. Then with a sigh she went back into the house and started picking up the things, straightening the rooms.\nHugh's mother said, \"Don't do that tonight, Delsa. You're tired. Let's just leave everything, and I'll come over tomorrow morning and help your mother clear up.\"\nDelsa was surprised at the gentleness in the woman's voice. After the disapproval of the early evening, this kindness seemed suddenly sweet and dear. Delsa smiled gratefully and said, \"I hate to do that?leave my party things for you two to clean up!\"\nBut her mother said, \"You have to go to school tomorrow, Delsa, and we have the whole day to putter about in. Go on to bed.\"\n\"You'll maybe want to show that nice boy some of the sights around here,\" Hugh's mother suggested, insinuatingly, \"the old mill up the canyon, or that abandoned mine, or the spot where the Indians held their powwows in pioneer days. So you go to bed now, it's late.\"\nDelsa kissed the two women goodnight and went slowly upstairs. So that was it! They were holding out a very definite olive branch?she could take it and be in their good graces again, or she could ignore it and have that ugly bat of disapproval between them.\nShe smiled sadly, she understood them so well. Alec Windsor looked something like Hugh; he was a service man like Hugh; he was a stranger like Hugh?therefore, he was good and dear like Hugh. Also, and very important to them, he was betrothed to a WAC, a romantic figure beside whom Delsa, country school teacher, was colorless and ineffective.\nSo they would have her show Alec the sights, ride horseback with him, talk to him?even flirt with him if he wanted to do a little harmless flirting on his month's furlough. Then he would go away, and Hugh's Delsa would be safe and wholly Hugh's again. She would have shaken off her interest in Jeff Holden and Jeff's children.\nWell, Delsa thought, as she lay staring out of the window, across the dark toward Hugh's old room, why not? She had no interest in Jeff, except to help him out because so desperately needed help. And she had no interest in Alec, either. But if they wanted her to take their medicine she would take it?and with a vengeance.\nShe sat up in bed with sudden resolution. Maybe they were, unwittingly, giving her the answer to her own secret problem! She could be nice to Alec at first, as if just to please them. Then she could let them think that she had fallen in love with him?the nebulous plan in her mind began to take shape?furtive and secret, but definite.\nMaybe she could make Alec think she was in love with him?what if he did belong to another?

Her potted plants, her brooms, and these: The brightly colored rags she meant to braid. The handkerchiefs she ironed, her glasses laid With neat precision by her much-read book.

South Sanpete Stake (Utah) ELVIRA MELLOR, former first counselor, Manti Center Ward Relief Society, reports an anniversary program held Tuesday, March 13, 1945. The theme was \"Relief Society, Keeper of the Golden Key.\" A character representing Emma Hale, the first to hold the Golden Key, gave a brief summary of events at the initial organization and led in singing \"The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning.\" \"Charity\" was introduced who spoke of her part in Relief Society. Then \"Music\" told of the benefits she adds to the organization. A character depicting Emmeline B. Wells explained woman's educational privileges attained through Relief Society and told of the study courses instituted during her presidency. A stake board member then gave her interpretation of Relief Society's future frontiers. The majesty and power of Relief Society cannot be measured; no one but God alone can determine the treasured heights of love, the breadth of charity, or sound the depths of knowledge. The scope of our work, the possibilities of our development, are bounded only by woman's capacities and eventualities. The Relief Society is as broad as eternity, as far-reaching as love, and holds the Golden Key for richer blessings above. South Los Angeles Stake (Calif.) SISTER MAUDE McOMIE, second counselor in the South Los Angeles Stake Relief Society, reports the following unusual program: \"Commemorating the one-hundred and third birthday and anniversary on March 7th, the South Los Angeles Stake Relief Society arranged an unique affair. ?To put on a program in the stake house would not be unusual, and with the thought of our war mothers, their anguish of soul for their sons and husbands, we wanted to do something for them, to reach out a kindly hand and have them feel and realize our love for them. This could not be done individually, but collectively we could convey, in a measure, some gesture that would be fitting and appropriate to honor these women. With this in mind, we remembered the beautiful window The Last Supper' at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. What a beautiful setting it would make for a program! They could view the window, listen, and think of the sacrifice Christ made for them. In contemplating the greatness of this sacrifice they could derive comfort in knowing that he understood the suffering of their hearts. \"Out of this grew the following program: Welcome Mrs. Blanche M. Johnson \"The Holy City\" by Stephen Adams Hyrum J. Christiansen, tenor Invocation Mr. W. W.

Austin Miles Mr. Christiansen Tribute to War Mothers and Wives President Noble Waite Benediction Mrs. Lillian Collings Taps Mrs. Glenna Nelson \"The setting alone was a glorious sight, and something that mere words cannot describe. \"At the conclusion of the program each gold-star mother was presented with a corsage, a token of love from the stake board. Following this, the haunting beauty of taps echoed through the beautiful 'Court of Honor Building'.\" Mt.

ANNUAL PICNIC OF THE LINCOLN WARD RELIEF SOCIETY', (TACOMA), SEATTLE STAKE, (WASHINGTON) Photograph submitted by Vilate C. Bottoms, secretary Work Meeting Plan now for Christmas AN APRON DAY FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS CHRISTMAS will be upon us before we know it! Conditions this year present a real opportunity for Relief Society to help its members make lovely gifts for Christmas out of materials they may have on hand. Let us plan the three remaining Relief Society work meetings before Christmas most carefully, so that they will be profitable for all who attend. In addition to necessary work-meeting activities, let us offer special projects designed to interest women who have not hitherto taken an active part in work meetings. There is a way to catch and hold the interest of every woman in the ward if the right way can be found. In order to find it, it is necessary to study carefully the needs of the particular group to which you wish to appeal and try out a number of activities that would seem to meet their special needs. If our program is organized to take care of all members who attend the meeting, we will be able to hold them and help them to solve many of their problems. The women who are interested and busy are not the ones who slip out and go home. Almost every woman makes or buys aprons to be given as Christmas gifts. We all delight to receive one, but how often the delight changes to disappointment when the aprons are tried on and are found to be uncomfortable and poor fitting. This year, when good materials are so difficult to get, it is more important than ever to have those who in the past have given \"just any apron\" consider whether the style and fit they select will be suitable for the one who will wear the apron. One ward with a very enterprising work leader planned a most successful apron day last fall. By looking ahead she was able to purchase enough materials and trimmings for the use of her group. No organdy ruffling was obtainable, but she found an organdy curtain which she had hemstitched in strips. This provided plenty of ruffling. Other trimming was picked up here and there, and soon the class leader had a very interesting assortment of materials and findings for her day. Patterns were selected carefully so that there were some suitable to each material and to every type of figure. Invitations were given to the ward women to come, purchase their materials, cut their aprons, and sew and fit them in the regular work meeting. Making aprons in a group is fun Page  because many ideas may be exchanged. Even though a ward leader may feel that she cannot purchase enough material this year for her entire group, such a day could still be carried out by using all the material available and having every woman who has an apron length of print tucked away in her home bring it for her own use. Odd lengths of bindings, bias tape, rickrack, and bits of lace, too, might be donated. When they are all brought together it will be astonishing to discover what can be done with them. Every tiny scrap can be utilized some way in Relief Society. Save odd pieces of material for toys or gift wrappings which will be discussed in future articles in the Magazine on activities for work-meeting days. This year let us help each other to see the possibilities in the things that are on hand. see: \"Combination Apron and Sewing Bag,\", pages 96-97. \"Utility Aprons,\", page 183. \"Notes From the Field,\" Mount Ogden Stake,, page 457.

Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, December 4, 1945 Objective: To trace the march of the saints westward, and to show that physical hardship can be more easily endured by those who are supported by the spirit of the Lord than by those who are without his spirit. WHEN the Lord set his hand to fulfill his promise and gather Israel, far-reaching were the results. Especially was this true in regard to the journey of the Mormon pioneers. To trace the westward march of the Mormon pioneers under the vigorous hand of President Brigham Young makes real the beginning scenes of God's promise to bring again Israel. A few comparisons of the journey of Israel of old with that of its modern counterpart are interesting. Under Moses were a people of one tongue, having the same customs and racial background that living as a nation brings. Brigham Young led a band of people whose roots were deep within no one nation but many, for the gospel call was to all the world. Ancient Israel was fed manna by the hand of the Lord; the pioneers of our day not only carried their own provisions, but, of necessity, had to plant en route for others to reap. It was to a land of milk and honey, of fertile soil and vineyards, that God sent his people in the days of yore; the modern Israelites for the cause of Zion had left homes of comfort to go into a wilderness, a vast terrain, which early trappers doubted could be made successfully to yield any crop. Had not the Lord planted in the hearts of these pioneers a faith in his word, the marvelous work of the latter days could never have been accomplished. Let it not be felt that suffering and pain were always the lot of the saints, though great indeed at times was their anguish. There was always a joy of spirit which blessed their efforts and made even the physical hardships lighter. To know the true heart of these souls is to know the perfect balance in life between material and spiritual values. With threats, day in and day out, from mobocrats and corrupt government officials, the saints learned to hold their peace and live. Page  For them it was the kingdom of God first, with the assurance that all else would be added. Such a spirit made them build the Nauvoo Temple, knowing their joy within its walls was to be only a matter of months. In fact, this beautiful edifice was not dedicated until after the great majority of the saints was on the march, having left to some three hundred persons the satisfaction of presenting to the Lord, in ceremonial prayer, this most stately of structures then to be found upon the upper windings of the Mississippi River. Nor were these people without their music and dancing. It is recorded within the diaries of many that after the ordinances of the day had been performed in the House of the Lord, there was often a period of recreation. To cover, within the allotted words for this lesson, even a hundredth part of the story of the journey from Nauvoo to the valleys of the mountains would demand the most strict editing of the facts. It is hoped, therefore, that while presenting this interesting part of our history, the teacher will bring to the class, whenever possible, the diaries of pioneers, together with any of their personal effects long preserved and cherished from early days: a fancy pair of gloves, a piece of prized silver, an exquisite shawl, a hand-painted dish or other such loved appointments of the cultured home. These things, somehow, found their way into the barrel bottoms, the odd box corners, and, often, an opportune opening in a wagon-bed. Here was a people sensitive. Too, to the fine arts of living even in the midst of hard requirements which schooled the heart to forego the luxuries. It was the spirit of the Lord, day and night, that made possible the arduous journey across the plains. A firm belief in him and his word put courage in the step and faith in the heart. Ever bear in mind this thought to understand fully the zeal with which the saints traveled on each different day with the hope for better things. What are the significant facts of the pioneers' journey westward? In the dead of winter, the first of the saints crossed the Mississippi from Nauvoo to begin the trek. It was Wednesday, the 4th of February, 1846. Two days later ferrying began in earnest. At the same time as this march by land began, there set sail from the New York harbor the S. S. Brooklyn, to carry by sea around Cape Horn and on to San Francisco two hundred and thirty-five members of the Church. Loaded within this vessel was also a good supply of all kinds of farming implements, tools for the carpenter, the blacksmith, and the wheelwright, together with the machinery for two gristmills and a sawmill. In addition, there were books on various subjects, a press with type and enough paper to start the printed word among the saints when they should arrive in their new-found home. Samuel Brannan was given the directions for this undertaking. It was to become a helping hand, extending material aid to the other companies of foot-weary emigrants whose weighted wagons, of necessity, had to load lightly the iron implements so needed to break the valley sod. LESSON DEPARTMENT 567 To those who were to travel by land or sea came the word from President Young: When the time comes to start westward we will continue to gather until Israel is gathered: let there be no feelings about who shall go first; those who go first will lay the foundations for those who shall come after, and none will be neglected in their time (D. H. C. Vol. VIL, P- 575)- Most of the month of February was spent, by those preparing for the journey by wagons, at a camp on Sugar Creek, Iowa, while, day by day, additional families rolled in to swell the number of exiles. Council meetings were held both at the camp and back in Nauvoo to lay plans for caring for the destitute and needy, many of whom had rushed off without proper supplies for the journey. President Young was prompted to give direct instructions to members of the camp as follows: I wish the brethren to stop running to Nauvoo, hunting, fishing, roasting their shins, idling away their time, and fix nose-baskets for their horses, and save their corn, and fix comfortable places for their wives and children to ride, and never borrow without asking leave, and be sure to return what was borrowed, lest your brother be vexed with you and in his anger curse you and then you would be cursed according to the power of the priesthood that brother possesses and evil will come upon you (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 586). In this winter outpost much suffering from the cold was endured. Nine infants were born at Sugar Creek during those February days. Dr. Richards recorded in his journal for the 19th: The wind blew steadily from the northwest accompanied by snow which fell to a depth of seven or eight inches, but much thawed as it fell, the storm was unceasing, and the evening was very cold (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 593). March of 1846 came in like a lion, and in its extreme cold the camp at Sugar Creek broke up. The journey west began in earnest. All through this month and the month of April which followed, the steady stream of saints pushed over the heavy soil of Iowa with its grassy and rolling lands and deep ravines. By April 24, some one hundred and forty-five miles west of Nauvoo, a camp site was selected and named Garden Grove. Here, within a short period, a thriving village was set upon a clearing. Samuel Bent was named president with Aaron Johnson and David Fullmer as counselors to direct this camp of Israel. Here, many of the saints were to remain, build, and plant for those who were to come after. President Brigham Young saw the need of holding ground while extending ever westward the march to the mountains. By now the great body of the saints had left Nauvoo. May brought the return of spring to the prairies. By the 18th, President Young, in company with Parley P. Pratt and others, found joy in the sights there were on every hand. Elder Pratt writes: One day riding about three or four miles through beautiful prairies, I came suddenly to some round and sloping hills, grassy, and crowned with beautiful groves of timber; while alternate open groves and forests seemed blended in all the beauty and harmony of an English park. While beneath and beyond, on the west, rolled a main branch of the Grand River, with its rich bottoms of alternate forest and prairie. As I approached this lovely scenery, several deer and wolves, being startled at the sight of me, abandoned the place and bounded away till lost from my sight and the groves. Being pleased and excited at the varied beauty before me, I cried out \"this is Mount Pisgah\" (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 607). With joy and the returning hope of the new season of the year, the saints set about building their second camp of major importance in Iowa. Land was fenced and preparations begun for planting and home building. William Huntington, Ezra T. Benson, and Charles C. Rich were chosen to take charge. But for President Young and his party the call was to press on. Over Indian trails and rude bridges they traveled until, on June 14, they arrived at the banks of the muddy Missouri not far from Council Bluffs. They were then in the land of the Potawatomis, a friendly tribe whose chiefs were kind. By the 29th, companies were ferrying across the river. At Council Bluffs, President Young waited to gather in the long train of companies, for he was desirous of giving his people instructions. When some five hundred wagons had wheeled in, their leader addressed the saints assembled. He warned them to be faithful to the Lord and press on. Wicked men would seek to prevent them from doing so, he said, but the saints would find the place to which the Lord would have them go if they would heed his words. Things now seemed right for the journey to continue, the summer months lay ahead and the Platte River with its green banks and shallow eddies lay flattened out some five hundred miles across the level plains of Nebraska. Here was the life-line of shade and drink for the travelers. Then came Wyoming and its Sweetwater leading high into the bracing air of the Rockies. Yes, the journey from here on gave a feeling of uplift and freedom in the heart. Then, too, it was June time of the year. On the closing day of this month came word from Washington. Captain James Allen of the United States Army arrived on the 30th to put an end to dreams. His credentials were for the raising of five hundred men to serve as volunteers in the war with Mexico, recently declared. Strange that a government which would permit thousands of its citizens to be mobbed, now should turn and ask such a people for the flower of their manhood to fight a war. Here was a chance for the saints to turn the other cheek, and this they did courageously. Five hundred men stepped forth within a period of weeks to complete the longest march in the history of the United States infantry. They not only wrote a chapter in the story of Mormon allegiance to the flag, but they were blessed to come through the war unharmed. \"Detachments of the battalion who wintered at Pueblo... Together with the main body of the Mississippi Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley, under direction of Captain James Brown,\" only five days after the arrival of the original company, bringing with them sixty wagons, one hundred head of fine horses and mules, and three hundred head of cattle. LESSON DEPARTMENT 569 How strange the ways of the Lord! Had it been written that upon the arrival of most of the saints in the promised land, domestic animals and modern wains would be there to greet them, would not this have taken a test of faith to believe! But this did not come to pass, however, without sacrifices, for because of the weakened condition of the main body of the saints, with the able-bodied men gone, it became necessary to make preparations for the coming winter. It was a bitter season of snow these exiles spent at Winter Quarters. Many lived in dugouts along the muddy bluffs not far from the Missouri River. At least the saints were consoled in the thought that they had been given permission to remain in that country, and had there found a true friend in Colonel Thomas L. Kane, who importuned the President of the United States in their behalf. Today, as solemn testimony of the bleak winter spent in Nebraska, there stands upon a hill in Florence a Mormon cemetery, within whose graves lie the bodies of many saints and those of infants born but to die of exposure in the cold. With their faces toward the east they await the call of a brighter morn. With the davming of the year 1847 came the voice of the Lord to:... President Brigham Young, at Winter Quarters, giving instructions for the guidance of the camps of Israel on their journeyings to the west. The Saints were to be organized into companies, with captains over hundreds, fifties and tens, as the case had been while journeying across Iowa. These companies were to be presided over by a president and two counselors, under the direction of the Twelve Apostles, who were at the head of all the camps of Israel. The Saints were to enter into a covenant \"to keep all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. (Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, p. 433). It was further the command of the Lord that departure for the West should be early in the spring in order to provide for the planting of crops. April 5, 1847, was the day when the march began. On up the north side of the Platte River it went, over the south pass of the Rocky Mountains, past Fort Bridger, west through Echo and East Canyons, then on to Big and Little Mountains which pointed to Emigration Canyon and the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. Stories of the landmarks of the plains, the forts, the Indians, the wild beasts and the travelers met en route, go to make up this eventful trek, until, from a bed in a carriage. President Young raised himself to look over the valley in the heart of the mountains and say, \"This is the place, drive on.\" It was in July, the month commemorating independence, that the saints arrived. Grateful and happy they were to mark their day of freedom in a new land as the 24th, which, singularly enough, counted the exact number of years since the Angel Moroni first brought the restored gospel to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the text to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word.\" 1. As early as six months after the organization of the Church the Lord, speaking through his prophet Joseph Smith, said the gathering of his elect \"into one place upon the face of this land\" must take place (Doc. And Gov. 29:8). Why are we as a people in a better position today to under stand the wisdom of the Lord in sounding such a call than were the few saints who were present when the revelation was given in September of 1830? In drawing out the answer to this question have the class reflect upon the world conditions today. These may be listed. Read Doc. and Cov. sections 1, 38, 88, 93 in the Doc. and Cov. Commentary. Found in these verses. Read any section in Doc. and Cov. 33.\nHave section 136 of the Doctrine and Covenants read with its introductory paragraph. Pay particular attention to the following parts of the revelation: verses 3, 6, 8, 10, 16, 20, 28, 31, 35, 36, 39. In the light of the lesson have these discussed.\n3. What are some of the interesting facts you know of the journey to the Rocky Mountains? Read chapters 37, 38, 39 in Essentials in Church History.\nThe following questions may be used if needed for further class activity or they may be assigned for home study. What facts of human interest may be gained from the diaries of the pioneers? Read \"Through Diaries of Long Ago,\" Children's Friend, July 1942.\nSpecial Note: Be sure to make full use of other material in the July 1944 issue of Thefor study in connection with the course in Church History.\n(Note: On this map an error was made in locating Harmony. The town of Harmony, now known as Oakland, should be located on the Susquehanna River, just south of the state line of New York and Pennsylvania. See Essentials in Church History, map page 47.) Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 3?Charity Envieth Not Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, December 4, 1945\nObjective: To show that the cultivation of the spirit of charity will rid our lives of envy.\nENVY works on the mind much as cancer does on the body. Instead of enriching the mind from without, it destroys it from within. Envy is a product of covetousness; it looks upon and desires that which is not its own, but upon that which belongs to another. Its ways are unholy evil: envy keeps one in misery by focusing his attention on that which he lacks; at the same time, it diverts one's energy from acquiring objects of one's desire in a profitable and legitimate way; and envy\ncauses one to dislike, and even to hate, the person who possesses that which he desires for himself.\nEnvy cannot be conquered by a frontal attack, by concentrating on the evil itself. To rid our lives of envy, we must look first for its cause, and second, to some power even greater than envy itself with which to erase it.\nEnvy has its roots in our own lack. It is an admission that we are not prepared to live a rich, soul-satisfying life. LESSON DEPARTMENT 571 Living the gospel win enable us to overcome the feeling of lack in our lives and rob envy of its nourishment. Alma tells us that, if we will plant the seed of faith (in the word of God) in our hearts, and nourish it with patience until it takes root in us, that by and by we?... Shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst (Alma 32:42 also note verses 27-43). \"Charity seeketh not her own.\" She rejoices in the success of others. She is aware, not of her own needs, but of the needs of others. Hers is the spirit of giving, of helping, of loving. A heart full of charity has no place in it for envy. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 3?Bible Influences As Revealed in Our Lyric Literature Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, December 18, 1945 Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace. Good will toward men. THIS heavenly lyric, voiced by angels over gentle Bethlehem in the long, long ago, touches the heart of our study. Its soulful lines carry a message of divine meaning for wayward humanity. They point the way toward heaven. This inspiring song is sometimes called the first of Christmas carols. Carol singing among human folk, however, did not come until more than a thousand years following that holy night. And yet, it was the inspiration of that beautiful song and the coming of the Christ child it heralded which gave to us the car- (Luke 2:14) ols we love to sing to help keep Christmas a holy day. In a true sense, a carol is a song of praise for a festal occasion. As Christianity was spread among the common folk, their joyousness began to find expression, particularly at Christmas time, in singing praise to the Savior. Lyric lines springing out of their hearts became, with time, charming folk songs; and the best loved of these were passed on through the years. From this rich heritage we get such soul-lifting expressions as the following; It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, From angels bending near the earth, to touch their harps of gold; Peace on earth, good will to men; from heav'n's gracious king. The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing. O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant; O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; Come and behold him, born the king of angels; O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord! Some of our gifted writers, catching the spirit of the folk carols, have created lyrics which take place with those time-honored songs. Among these are Luther's \"Cradle Hymn\" and \"Silent Night, Holy Night\" by Franz Gruber, known by heart and sung in many tongues. Another that holds our affection for its sweetness and light is \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" by Phillips Brooks, inspired on a Christmas Eve spent by him in this town where the Savior was born. Following is the first stanza of that beautiful song: O little town of Bethlehem! How still we see thee lie; Above thy deep and dreamless sleep, The silent stars go by; Yet in thy dark streets shineth The everlasting light; The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee tonight. All down the years the story of the Christ child, with the angels and the shepherds, the star and the wise men, has been the inspiration of lyric expression. Countless songs have been and are still being created around this theme. Another sacred theme that has profoundly influenced our lyric literature is the resurrection of the Savior. To a world groping in spiritual darkness, this divine event brought radiant light. With the sublime revelation that man can rise from the tomb into immortal existence, life took on new meaning, more heavenly purpose. For art expression, it was the opening of a new vista, arched by a rainbow of hope for a more glorious future. Lyric lines, expressive of faith in immortality, accepting death as a part of the eternal life plan, as but a portal opening into a larger life, are to be found in many outstanding poems. Following are a few such sincere and helpful expressions: Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returneth. Was not spoken of the soul. ?\"Psalm of Life,\" Longfellow Ah, well for us all some sweet hope lies Deeply buried from human eyes. And in the hereafter angels may Roll the stone from its grave away. ?\"Maud Muller,\" Whittier #? * I stay my haste, I make delays? For what avails this eager pace? I stand amid the eternal ways And what is mine shall know my face. ?\"Waiting,\" John Burroughs * ?# Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea. But such a tide as moving seems asleep. Too full for sound and foam. When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. Twilight and evening bell. And after that the dark And may there be no sadness of farewell. When I embark; LESSON DEPARTMENT 573 For though from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to meet my Pilot face to face When I have crossed the bar. ?\"Crossing the Bar,\" Tennyson Another appealing theme was found in the loving service of the Savior. His living lessons in true charity, tolerance, brotherhood, neighborliness, and other Christian virtues have been a constant inspiration to authors. Illustrations that follow are typical of thousands of lines that echo the divine precepts and example of the Master in making the gospel live among men: She never found fault with you, never implied Your wrong by her right; and yet men at her side Grew nobler, girls purer, as through the whole town The children were gladder that pulled at her gown? ?\"My Kate,\" Elizabeth Barrett Browning *?? It is not just as we take it. This mystical world of ours. Life's field will yield as we make it A harvest of thorns or of flowers. ?\"Perseverance,\" Goethe KY God send us a little home To come back to when we roam. Red firelight and deep chairs. Small white beds upstairs. Homely flowers in brown sod. Overhead thy stars, O God! ?\"Prayer for Home,\" Anonymous If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain; If I can ease one life the aching.... I shall not live in vain. ?\"Success,\" Emily Dickinson I see from my house by the side of the road, By the side of the highway of life. The men who press on with the ardor of hope. The men who are faint with the strife. But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears? Both parts of an infinite plan; Let me live in a house by the side of the road And be a friend of man. ?\"The House by the Side of the Road,\" Sam Walter Foss All such poetical expressions serve to further the great purpose of the Savior in bringing the gospel to earth. He spent his life doing good among men. Lyrical lines such as these help us to see more clearly the inner meaning of his divine work, and to feel something of the joy of our Father in heaven when we follow in the footsteps of his Only Begotten Son. It was something of this thought that inspired James Whitcomb Riley when he penned in homely dialect the little poem called ?Jim?? a tribute to a self-sacrificing shoemaker. Jim was always giving, always helping and cheering those who came to his shop. Even in his closing days, when an incurable illness was taking his strength, the kindly cobbler had ever a pleasant word to give to others. And after he had passed to his reward, the poet has one of Jim's fellow workers say tenderly: When God made Jim, I bet he didn't do anything else that day But jest set around and feel good. No small contribution to the bringing of the Savior into our daily lives has been made by gifted poets of our own faith. Songs of their creation that we love to sing not only keep us actively helpful, but also lift us closer to a heaven of reality, where the warmth of both father and mother love awaits those who win salvation through a life of righteousness. This appealing truth finds most artistic expression in \"O My Father,\" a lyric prayer by Eliza R. Snow, which ranks among the finest of religious poems. Besides the wealth of carols and hymns, anthems and oratorios linking directly with the Bible, there is a wealth of other lyrics that are in tune with its spirit. Songs of innocent childhood, of nature in all her moods, of home and friends, of pure love, of loyalty and patriotism?all are in consonance with true religion. Lines like these that follow surely lift us a little nearer heaven: My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky. ?Wordsworth The little bird sits at his door in the sun A-tilt like a blossom among the leaves. ?Lowell I can hear the robin's warble and the meadowlark's sweet trills All around the dear old homestead lyin' there among the hills. ?Harrison R. Merrill But the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze Of a crisp and sunny morning of the early autumn days Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mock? When the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder's in the shock. ?\"When the Frost Is On the Punkin,\" James Whitcomb Riley It has been a long evening. I have watched A sky of clouds go by. God lent A crown of sunshafts To flash and fall away. I am content. ?Leon Loofbourow Think every morning when the birds peep through The dim, leaf-latticed windows of the grove. How jubilant the happy birds renew Their old melodious madrigals of love! And when you think of this, remember, too, 'Tis always morning somewhere, and above The awakening continents from shore to shore Somewhere the birds arc singing evermore. ?Longfellow I'm hungering in the city for the smell of fragrant timber. For the valleys where the birchbark smoke goes curling through the trees. For the lazy miles of lakeshore, where the blue waves kiss the pebbles, In the land of skyblue water, up beyond the inland seas. ?May Stanley And last, this soul-stirring stanza from a nineteen-year-old American air pilot who gave his life to help preserve our freedom: Up, up the long delirious blue I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace Where never lark, or even eagle flew? And while with silent lifting mind I've trod The high untrespassed sanctity of grace, Put out my hand and touched the face of God. ?John G. Magee, Jr. Discussion and Activities 1.

My feet keep time to this tumultuous hymn, My blood through every secret channel flies, My throat bursts forth in a melodious strain.

And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER IV SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, jilted by Hugh Temple who is serving in Australia, begins to take an interest in the children of Jeff Holden, widower principal of the school where Delsa teaches. The townsfolk, who do not know of Hugh's change of heart, think that Delsa is interested in Jeff, and condemn her for her infidelity to Hugh. THE girls came noisily into the house, shaking their long curls, waving letters in their hands, hugging big knitting bags close to their hearts. Delsa greeted them gaily, with the special little comment that each one merited. These were her chums and playmates since babyhood, they were as familiar to her as if they had belonged to her own family. She knew of their absent sweethearts, their hopes, their dreams and longings. There's something very special about a small town?especially a small Utah town, Delsa thought, with everyone belonging to the same Church, knowing everyone else. It was just like one big family. They settled down to the business of the evening at last. The girls got out their sewing or knitting or crocheting and went to work. And as the others worked, one would read her letters, or bits of them?the bits she cared to share?each girl taking a turn. Delsa sat back in a corner working on the exquisite tablecloth she was crocheting, thinking, I can't read them Hugh's letter?not a word of it. I would break down and cry if I did. And I can't lie to them and say I haven't heard from Hugh, for his mother knows I have?and by this time, probably, every one of them knows it, too. What shall I say? Shall I say, \"Well, girls, I am withdrawing from the War Widows! I no longer have a right to belong? I'm no longer engaged to Hugh Temple! Should I say that now and have it over with? Grace Metcalfe looked at Delsa's tablecloth and sniffed. \"You'll never get that done, Delsa Marriott,\" she said, \"if you don't hurry. I don't think it's grown a stitch since last meeting.*' Delsa made herself laugh. She was sure that Grace had heard that Hugh's mother was displeased at her going to Jeff Holden's every day. If nice little Millie Lewis had heard it, surely Grace, who missed nothing in the way of gossip, had heard, also. She was gently baiting Delsa, but Delsa was not going to be drawn into any discussion of her own affairs tonight. She made herself laugh brightly, and reply casually. Millie rushed to her rescue. \"Delsa's got a surprise for you all tonight,\" she cried. \"A big surprise!\" Delsa looked up at her friend in astonishment. Millie had asked her to keep it a secret. Lina caught her breath sharply. She, too, had been made to promise secrecy. But Millie giggled, and would say no more. Page  She had succeeded in diverting their attention. They began to tease Millie and Delsa to tell them what she had planned, and Delsa was thankful for the minutes wasted in this nonsense, as they delayed the moment when the girls would ask, \"And now, what did Hugh say in his last letter, Delsa?\" But the demand came at last and Delsa, scarcely knowing what words she would say, looked at her friends and told them, quietly, \"Hugh was lonely, girls. There isn't a word of his last letter that I can very well share with anyone. It was meant just for me?\" The girls murmured, \"Toor Hugh! Delsa, give us his last address and we'll all write to him! We'll cheer him up!\" And Delsa heard Hugh's mother sniffle a little in the background, trying to let Delsa know that she felt sorry for her son, away off in Australia, loving, trusting the girl back home. Delsa glanced at the clock. \"We'll have to have our refreshments now if we're going to be ready for the surprise,\" she said, and hurried out into the kitchen to prepare the cake and ice cream that was the standard party food. Her mother came to help her, but Hugh's mother moved on into the living room with the girls, tacitly taking her stand with them and Hugh and against Delsa. DELSA felt her lip curving in a bitter smile and shook her head angrily. Sour old maid, already! She thought, and you haven't even released Hugh yet. What will your lips look like ten years from now? They had scarcely finished the ice cream when they heard voices on the porch, and Jim Lewis burst into the room. \"Surprise! Surprise!\" giggled Millie, and Lina was in Jim's arms, radiant, \"Oh, Jim, I could hardly bear it, waiting for you to come!\" Now Delsa had no more fears for her own secret. Everyone was hugging Jim, pouring out eager questions, laughing. Relief was in their voices and their laughter?the same relief Delsa had felt when she had learned that Jim was home. Then she remembered Jim's buddy, and would have crowded past the little knot to make him welcome, but Jim saw her and went to her. \"How's Delsa?\" he asked, lifting her chin and kissing her lightly. \"Oh, Jim!\" she cried, and didn't mind the tears that blurred his familiar face. \"Jim, it's so good to see you. You look so well!\" \"I brought my buddy along,\" Jim found the chance to say. \"Back up, girls. I want you all to meet Alec Windsor. Alec, this is my sister's and Lina's crowd?shall I tell you their names now, or one by one, so you'll have half a chance to remember them?\" Delsa's eyes went to the dark figure now beside Jim. He was like Hugh? that same eager, slanting-in-to-the-wind look about him; the same dark eyes and hair lifting from a tanned forehead. She held out her hand. \"I'm Delsa Marriott,\" she said simply. \"I'm glad you could come with Jim.\" Alec took her hand and looked down into her eyes. \"Jim's told me about you?about AND FOR ETERNITY 553 all the girls here?I envied him. It was just as if he had a dozen or more sisters waiting here at home to make him happy. You look just as he said you would, Delsa.\" Jim, who had gone over to greet the two older women, now came and extricated Alec from the laughing girls, and took him across the room. Delsa, watching, could see how Hugh's mother stared at the boy's resemblance to her son; could see how she bent eagerly to welcome him; how she adopted Alec immediately. Her own mother said, '1 think there's a little ice cream left, if you boys would like a dish,\" and everyone roared with laughter. It was so like old times?like the high school days, when the same crowd of girls, calling themselves the Merry Old Maids, had met. When it was just about time for them to break up the party, all the boys their age?Hugh and Jim and Louis and the rest-would drop by to walk the girls home. And then Mrs. Marriott would say the same thing, \"There's a little ice cream left,\" and would feed the whole crowd again. JIM and Alec loved the ice cream \" and cake, and the two mothers beamed tenderly on them as they ate. Delsa thought, \"I didn't realize how much, how dreadfully much, they miss the boys, too!\" When they could eat no more, Jim looked longingly at the record player and said, ?I guess we couldn't have a dance or two, Delsa? I promise we'll not play favorites? but give you all a whirl, if you'll only let us. It's been so long since we had a real dance?\" \"Why, of course, Jim!\" Delsa cried. \"We'd love it! The old records need a little exercise?if they aren't dimmed with rust and dust from disuse.\" She selected one of the crowd's favorite discs and set it in place. The girls watched worshipfully as Jim put his arm about Lina and his cheek against her hair and started to dance. Alec went to Millie, and Delsa felt a strange ache in her heart as he began to circle the room with her chum. Delsa was changing the record when she felt Alec's tall form beside her. Her hands fumbled, and his firm brown fingers took the disc and placed it in position. He pressed the button and the record began to turn. \"Our dance?\" he said, and his arm went about her and she was dancing with him. Delsa's first thought was, it's heaven to be dancing again! Then she smiled to herself. She had danced many times since the boys left?danced with the men and the older school boys. But it wasn't the same. Alec had to bend his head to talk to her above the music, but he said, \"Tm glad that I could come with Jim. I'm going to have a good time, I can see that plainly. And I hope you'll help.\" \"Help?\" Delsa asked, her straying thoughts not catching his meaning. \"Yes!\" he grinned down at her. \"I'd like to,\" Delsa smiled, \"but I doubt if I'll get a chance. You'll have more girls wanting to help you have a good time than you'll need!\" \"But have you ever noticed,\" he asked seriously, \"that it isn't always the many that make the much?\" She looked up at him, baffled, and he laughed down at her.\n\"I've found that one companion?the right one?can do more towards providing a good time than any number of miscellaneous folks,\" he explained.\nThey danced in silence for a moment, and then Alec asked \"Do you have those here? But of course you do! Do you ride?\"\nWhen Delsa nodded he went on, \"Well then, I appoint you chief guide and pointer-outer to show me the wonders of this valley. Jim will have no time, what with a wedding and a bride to look after, so I'll be left high and dry unless you take care of me.\"\nDelsa smiled.\n\"Wait and see,\" she said.\nTheir dance over, Delsa sat beside Hugh's mother while the two boys danced with every girl in turn.\nDelsa and her voice troubled, \"Do you think he's like Hugh, Aunt Martha?\"\n\"A little,\" Hugh's mother said judiciously, \"only not nearly so good looking, of course, and not so tall. And his shoulders aren't broad like Hugh's?\"\nSuddenly Delsa felt the tension inside her dissolve and she smiled and gave Hugh's mother a quick, affectionate hug.\n\"That's just what I thought,\" she said.\nHugh's mother returned her friendliness. She patted Delsa's hand and said softly, \"Poor boy! I feel so sorry for him?no mother, no family, no town full of friends waiting for him. I can't help thinking how it must be with Hugh?away off there in Australia. He's a stranger here, just like Alec is here, Delsa,\nnot knowing anyone. I hope somebody is trying to make him happy.\"\nBitterness twisted Delsa's lips again, and she turned her head so that Hugh's mother wouldn't see it, as she answered, \"Someone is, Aunt Martha! Surely someone has taken Hugh under her wing!\"\nAt last the evening was over and the crowd was leaving. Jim and Alec and the girls said their goodbyes and went laughing out into the clear, cool night?Jim with Lina, of course, and Alec Windsor walking with Millie.\nDELSA stood in the open doorway, watching them go down the walk and turn into the road, going in different directions toward their homes. Then with a sigh she went back into the house and started picking up the things, straightening the rooms.\nHugh's mother said, \"Don't do that tonight, Delsa. You're tired. Let's just leave everything, and I'll come over tomorrow morning and help your mother clear up.\"\nDelsa was surprised at the gentleness in the woman's voice. After the disapproval of the early evening, this kindness seemed suddenly sweet and dear. Delsa smiled gratefully and said, \"I hate to do that?leave my party things for you two to clean up!\"\nBut her mother said, \"You have to go to school tomorrow, Delsa, and we have the whole day to putter about in. Go on to bed.\"\n\"You'll maybe want to show that nice boy some of the sights around here,\" Hugh's mother suggested, insinuatingly, \"the old mill up the canyon, or that abandoned mine, or the spot where the Indians held their powwows in pioneer days. So you go to bed now, it's late.\"\nDelsa kissed the two women goodnight and went slowly upstairs. So that was it! They were holding out a very definite olive branch?she could take it and be in their good graces again, or she could ignore it and have that ugly bat of disapproval between them.\nShe smiled sadly, she understood them so well. Alec Windsor looked something like Hugh; he was a service man like Hugh; he was a stranger like Hugh?therefore, he was good and dear like Hugh. Also, and very important to them, he was betrothed to a WAC, a romantic figure beside whom Delsa, country school teacher, was colorless and ineffective.\nSo they would have her show Alec the sights, ride horseback with him, talk to him?even flirt with him if he wanted to do a little harmless flirting on his month's furlough. Then he would go away, and Hugh's Delsa would be safe and wholly Hugh's again. She would have shaken off her interest in Jeff Holden and Jeff's children.\nWell, Delsa thought, as she lay staring out of the window, across the dark toward Hugh's old room, why not? She had no interest in Jeff, except to help him out because so desperately needed help. And she had no interest in Alec, either. But if they wanted her to take their medicine she would take it?and with a vengeance.\nShe sat up in bed with sudden resolution. Maybe they were, unwittingly, giving her the answer to her own secret problem! She could be nice to Alec at first, as if just to please them. Then she could let them think that she had fallen in love with him?the nebulous plan in her mind began to take shape?furtive and secret, but definite.\nMaybe she could make Alec think she was in love with him?what if he did belong to another? Hadn't a stranger stolen Hugh from her? She could get even with them all this way?and what did it matter what her own feelings were?\nWith her plan slowly growing in her mind, Delsa lay back on her pillow and slept. (To be continued)"

Indeed it has been a theme of the prophets down through the centuries.\nThe Master of the world both by example and precept confirmed, in a superlative way, the truth of this message, and is appropriately referred to as the Prince of Peace. At the beginning of his ministry, he called to his aid twelve men, designated apostles, to declare the gospel of the kingdom to the world, first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles. All but a handful of the Jews rejected their Lord and his message of peace and \"nailed him to a tree.\" It seemed that Christianity was doomed to perish from the earth. But out of Tarsus of Cilicia was to come forth a man of the tribe of Benjamin who was destined to go down in history as one of the greatest missionaries of all times.

Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.\" Saul was obedient to the heavenly command and Ananias baptized him into the kingdom following a visitation of the Master, who said: \"For he (Saul) is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.\" How well Saul, now Paul, fulfilled this commission is a well-known story to the student of the"

However, gross darkness ultimately covered the earth and the voice of prophecy was heard no more over the centuries. But at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the heavens were again opened. By divine command, the Church of Jesus Christ was restored to earth through Joseph the Prophet. Soon thereafter, the same voice, which nearly two thousand years before had called the lowly Galilean fishermen from their nets to become fishers of men, was heard again, saying: Behold I send you out to reprove the world of all their unrighteous deeds, and to teach them of a judgment which is to come. And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.... Wo, I say again, unto that house, or that village or city that rejecteth you, or your words, or your testimony of me; For I, the Almighty, have laid my hands upon the nations, to scourge them for their wickedness. And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from the earth until I have completed my work which shall be cut short in righteousness (Doc. And Gov. Sec. 84:87 et seq.). THE first great missionary movement in this dispensation was inaugurated in the fall of 1830 when the Church was only six months old. A company of four elders, headed by Oliver Cowdery and Parley P. Pratt, was appointed by the Lord to bear the gospel to the Indians at and surrounding Independence, Missouri, on the frontiers of Western America. Their labors met with but little success among the Lamanites, but a rich harvest of souls was garnered by these men at Hyrum in the vicinity of Kirtland, Ohio, resulting in a migration of the Church from Fayette, New York, to Kirtland, which now became its headquarters. A little later the gospel was taken to Canada by Parley P. Pratt, where he found awaiting him a noble band of God-fearing truth seekers under the leadership of John Taylor, later to become a president of the Church. From here the gospel was finally to cross the broad Atlantic to the British Isles. The missionary work of the elders in the British Isles, under the able leadership of Heber C. Kimball, was phenomenal. Thousands, in the course of a few months, became identified with the Church, many of whom migrated to Zion. The opening of the British Mission occurred in the fateful year of 1837, a year fraught with great peril for the Latter-day Saints. A financial crisis, nation wide, left its impress upon the membership of the Church. The \"Kirtland Safety Society\" sponsored by the Prophet and other leading brethren of the Church failed as a result, largely, of poor management. The cashier of the institution, a one-time faithful elder, was found guilty of immoral conduct and of misappropriating the funds of the society to the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars, thus placing the institution in a precarious condition. The Prophet gave warning of the impending disaster, but without avail. He therefore resigned his position as president, and withdrew from the concern with the remark, that \"no institution of the kind, established upon just and righteous principles for a blessing not only to the Church, but to the whole nation, would be suffered to continue its operations in such an age of darkness, speculation and wickedness.\" MISSIONARY WORK OF THE CHURCH 517 Added to this financial disaster was the terrible treatment given our people in the State of Missouri by their enemies. They had been driven from their homes in Jackson County, and for a brief period had found respite in the northern and eastern counties. In the year 1837, the hydra-headed monster of vilification and persecution had begun to raise its head. As a result of the financial difficulties and bitter persecution, a dreadful wave of apostasy swept through the Church, carrying to their spiritual deaths, many of the leading officials of the Church, including several of the Twelve Apostles. The awful state of affairs led the Prophet to remark that it seemed *'as though all the powers of earth and hell were combining their influence in an especial manner to overthrow the Church at once, and make a final end.\" In this hour of deep sorrow and anguish, the Prophet appealed to the Almighty for wisdom and guidance, and in response came the voice of the Lord declaring that something new must be done for the salvation of the Church. Accordingly, on the 4th day of June, 1837, Elder Heber C. Kimball was called by the Prophet, while in the Kirtland Temple, \"to preside over a mission to England, to be the first foreign mission of the Church of Christ in the last days\" (D. H. C., Vol. II, page 489). In like manner, as the missionary labors of Paul and his associates saved the Church in ancient times from dissolution for a brief span, so did the preaching of the gospel in foreign lands by Heber C. Kimball and his companions save the Church in these latter days. The distinguishing difference between these two events was the fact that the Church of Christ in the meridian of time was not destined to survive the ultimate ravages of apostasy, while assurance has been given by the Almighty that the Restored Church shall stand forever amidst the wreck of nations and the crash of worlds. Not only has missionary work been the saving power, but also the enricher of the Church. I refer not to things of a material character, but to contributions on a spiritual and intellectual plane, as represented in language, literature, philosophy, and art. Every year over a period of several decades the Church has been represented by an average of two thousand young men and women, who have traveled as missionaries in most of the countries of the world. The return of these young people to the body of the Church has meant the infiltration of new ideas and new methods of doing things, thus rendering our culture the most cosmopolitan to be found in the world. Not only has enrichment come to the Church as a whole, but the development to be noticed in the missionary upon his return home is little short of phenomenal. He went into the world an inexperienced youth from the farm, the workshop, or the class room; he returns a well-rounded individual prepared through his experiences to meet almost any exigency that may arise in his journey of life. These young people have been called home to wear the colors of their country for the duration of the war, thus leaving the responsibility of preaching (at the Church upon the shoulders of a few of the older brethren and sisters and a very limited number of our young women, together with local brethren and sisters who are called to do part-time service.\nBut in spite of these restrictions, I am bold to declare that never before in the history of Mormondom has the leaven of Mormonism been more widely diffused than at the present time. The Church has nearly ten per cent of its membership in the service of the country. The vast majority of these young people, both by example and precept, are pleased to bear witness of the restored gospel to the great numbers whom they meet daily. Some of the strongest branches that we have in the Central States Mission are largely officered by servicemen and women, and the predominance in membership is composed largely of that class. Our branch at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, is a splendid example of this. I think no finer, energetic\ngroup of worshipers can be found anywhere in the Church than these army men and their wives. And what can be said of Ft. Sill can truthfully be said of many such branches throughout the world.\nThe spirit of these servicemen was beautifully expressed by a young man in an address before our Topeka conference recently. Following are his words as nearly as I can remember them:\nMy government has spent a great deal on me to make me a good soldier. It has supplied me with everything that modern ingenuity can devise for my comfort, with arms and ammunition, together with their proper use, as well as with other equipment, including the finest and most perfect protection that I shall carry with me when I go overseas to engage in combat for the Priesthood of the Son of God which I prize above all else. Upon it I shall rely, and I pray that I shall exercise it in righteousness before the Lord.\nSome of our number have expressed themselves as feeling that we are in the process of gleaning human souls, but I am convinced that following this war, with the gospel seeds that are now being sown by our young men and women, we shall reap the greatest harvest in the whole history of the Church. God grant that this may be so. NEW TESTAMENT Dott J. Sartori Here, within this black morocco cover. Abide His word and sacred ministry, Among these printed symbols angels hover, And here is light to set the prisoned free."

            "content": "the Constitution of the United States, granting suffrage to women, was introduced in both the House and the Senate of the United States, April 17, 1913. It was christened the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.Six more years elapsed before Congress passed the Amendment. On May 21, 1919, it passed the House of Representatives and on June 4, 1919, it passed the Senate. Before it could become effective, however, it was necessary that it be ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states. On August 18, the final state to ratify, Tennessee, gave woman suffrage the constitutional majority it needed and victory was won. The amendment which stands now as the law of the land reads as follows: Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. Section 2. Congress shall have power by appropriate legislation to enforce the provisions of this article. Susan B. Anthony was a faithful and loyal friend to the women of Utah. She kept in touch with them all during her period of leadership, and they worked closely with her in the cause dearest to her heart. She visited Utah on a number of occasions, and from the year 1879 Utah sent delegates regularly to the meetings of the National Suffrage Association, where they took active part in the deliberations. She rejoiced with them when they had the vote from 1870 to 1886; and because of their experience and knowledge and their training in organization work, she solicited their interest and help in her national program. She sympathized with them when they were disfranchised by the Congress of the United States in 1886, and stood by them as a true, faithful friend. She rejoiced again with them when Utah became a state, in April 1895, \"4 44 State constitution included a clause giving them full suffrage. She immediately wrote Mrs. Emily S. Richards of Salt Lake City, Chief Organizer for Utah and a member of the National Executive Committee, as follows: Well I am glad you are all awake to the cause out there in Utah. You have the power in your own hands, and if you do not move on to better things political, it will not be the fault of the men alone, you women will be equally responsible with them. You cannot therefore afford to be idle or indifferent to the political action of your city and state. With love to all and yourself the most, Susan B. Anthony. One month later, May 12, Miss Anthony and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, who were touring the West, visited Utah where they were enthusiastically received. A suffrage conference for two days was held, followed by a reception given in their honor by Mr. And Mrs. F. S. Richards at their beautiful home. Hundreds of people attended, including State officials and military officers from Fort Douglas. Governor Caleb W. West and his staff in full regalia stood in the receiving line with the host and hostess and honored guests. The sincere love of the women of Utah and of the Relief Society for Susan B. Anthony was demonstrated at the time of her death, early in March 1906, when a memorial service was held for her in the Salt Lake City Assembly Hall on Relief Society anniversary day, March 17.

            "content": "Postwar Planning\" delivered at the Friday afternoon session of the 115th annual general conference, April 6, 1945, in the Assembly Hall. I WOULD like to say a word about the returning soldier, that being a question about which we all talk and hear so much. I said something about postwar planning at the last conference and pointed out that we could and should plan to bring our soldiers back to homes of purity, chastity, and of righteousness, and that it took no worldly position, no wealth, to carry on that postwar planning. I want to add just a word along that line today... To bridge over the time when they [soldiers] return as heroes for achievements in war, until they may resume their peace-time occupations and become heroes in peace and in peaceful occupations, to bridge that over is one of the tasks we shall have to undertake and to which we must give our best effort and best thought. I am not thinking of the temporal side of the bridge-over, I am thinking of the spiritual side, and what that means; and in that connection it seems to me that they who are to play the greater part are the mothers, the wives, and the sweethearts of those who return. When all is said and done it will be our sisters who must take on that great load and that tremendous responsibility. Radio programs, magazines, and newspaper columns are more and more filling with instructions about how to treat our returning soldiers. All the deductions of modem psychology, and its kindred mental sciences are paraded for the guidance of the wives, the mothers, the sweethearts, in meeting, winning, and holding the boy back from the war. But I would not exchange the unerring inspired instinct of a good woman, fired with mother love, or wife love, or the love of a loyal, chaste sweetheart, for all that men have ever written. The boys say they do not wish to be regarded as problem children. They want to get home and enter again the family circle, and in its sacred precincts again to take up life and forget hate, carnage, and death. I believe their cry will be, \"Let us live again in love\"; and you mothers, wives, and sweethearts can bring to them this blessing. None other can. So in this crisis we turn to the women of the earth to save them and to save us men from ourselves. So it has been, in reality, in every great world crisis, however much it may have seemed otherwise. Yours, you sisters, has been the loyalty that has never wanted; your courage has not failed, has not been daunted, whatever the odds. You have often recognized a lost cause long before your men folks; you frequently have seen victory long before it came within the vision of those who battled. Your joy and tenderness and fortitude have succored the wounded and eased the passing of those who are called beyond. You never fail in kindness and mercy; your love endures forever. May God bless you, for you are angels of mercy. So, you mothers, wives, sweethearts, take into the sacred precincts of your heart around the altars of your homes these souls wounded in body, in mind, in spirit, and heal them as you alone.

            "content": "Settling Raymond, Alberta, Canada Jennie B. Knight Former Member Relief Society General Board RAYMOND is situated in Southern Alberta, Canada. It was founded by Jesse Knight of Utah, and named after his oldest son. It was built by pioneers who had faith in its future, and it took real pioneers with courage, thrift, good judgment, and faith to cope with problems that confronted the early settlers of that region. That they were victorious and are still a prudent, progressive, and religious people is shown in their beautiful modern homes and schools, churches and public buildings, their farms and ranches, factories, mills and elevators that today dot the land as far as the eyes can see. The name of Jesse Knight is so interwoven in the history of this commonwealth and the surrounding territory that it is fitting to relate how he came to be its founder. He was a man who had implicit confidence in the leaders of his Church. At the ushering in of the twentieth century, President Lorenzo Snow sent his New Year's greeting to the world. This message greatly impressed Brother Knight who at that time was receiving great wealth from his metal mines in Utah. In this message, he read: Men and women of wealth, use your riches to give employment to the laborer! Take the idle from the crowded centers of population and place them on the un-tilled areas that await the hand of industry. Page 524 Unlock your vaults, unloose your purses and embark in enterprises that will give work to the unemployed and relieve the wretchedness that leads to vice and crime around you. Make others happy and you will be happy yourselves. Many propositions had been made to Brother Knight to invest his money, but none appealed to him until he heard about Canada. However, Apostle John W. Taylor and Charles McCarthy of Alberta came to see him and told him of the fertile lands in Southern Alberta and urged him to buy some of the thousands of acres. The project impressed him. He could see the possibility of using his money to magnify his \"stewardship,*' for it was only as a steward, he believed, that wealth came to him. In the spring of 1900, he sent his two sons, Oscar Raymond and Jesse William, to Canada to investigate the situation, the result being that they purchased 30,000 acres of land and set to work to stock it. Later, their father met them in Canada. The weather was ideal, the country beautiful and green. It looked like a real paradise to Jesse Knight. He was there only a few days before he had a clear idea of what he wanted to do. He would build a sugar factory that would give employment to Latter-day Saints and others who would come where they might secure land on easy terms and make homes for their children and themselves. On July 10, 1901, he purchased 226,000 acres of prairie land from the Canadian Northwest Irrigation Company and the Alberta Railroad and Irrigation Company through their agent, Hon. C. A. Magrath. SETTLING RAYMOND, ALBERTA, CANADA 525; THRESHING SCENE IN RAYMOND, CANADA, ON THE HEREFORD RANCH Yield, sixty bushels to the acre He signed a contract to build a sugar factory, and have it ready to handle the beet crop in 1903 and to keep it in operation for twelve years. This contract was guaranteed with a pledge of $50,000. Who but a man of faith could have made such an agreement in so short a time with nothing but a vast, grass-covered prairie surrounding this location? RAYMOND townsite was selected soon after the contract was signed, and on a bright Sunday afternoon, at the request of Presi-ident C. O. Card, friends from neighboring towns and ranches met to dedicate this townsite. There was not a tree, or even a tent to be seen as they stood on the buffalo-trodden soil to participate in the exercises. In the town charter, which was read. Brother Knight had insisted that it contain a forfeiture clause to the effect that if liquor, or gambling houses, or places of ill fame were established on the premises, the property holders would forfeit title to the land. The dedicatory prayer was offered by Apostle John W. Taylor. Songs of praise and thanksgiving filled the air and a feeling of welcome and good will was felt by all. The town of Raymond grew rapidly,, for in less than two years there were over fifteen hundred settled there. Most of them were young, including many college graduates. Buildings sprang up with mushroom rapidity, the blacksmith shop of Ephraim Hicks being the first to break the horizon. Many of the early homes were of the ?lean-to\" type, just one room with a slanting roof to which other rooms were added later. A church with a heating plant was built by Jesse Knight. This and the school house were the first public buildings erected. Charles McCarthy and T. O. And Louis King were the first to build mercantile stores. B. F. Rolf son was a carpenter and his house was the first to be finished. HANNAH GIBBS, who planted the first tree, arrived on September 3, 1901, with her nine children. George Munn, William Lamb, and families came September 2d. They experienced real difficulty in pitching their tents, as there was a bleak blizzard when they emerged from the mixed freight and passenger train. A number of families lived in tents during the first winter. Water for culinary purposes was hauled in barrels from the canal until Ray Knight had it piped into the center of town, and from there it was still hauled to the homes in barrels on sleds. In winter, the water was always frozen in the barrels, and if one wished a drink he had to chop the ice and melt it. Hannah Gibbs became the community nurse and doctor. She had her first experience as midwife March 16, 1902, when the first boy, Raymond Holbrook, was born. This nurse, taught by experience and faith, brought numerous babies into the world. She nursed each mother and babe for ten days for which service she received five dollars. She never lost a case. Even after Dr. Rivers settled in Raymond she was still called in on many occasions. Jessie Nilsson, a girl, was the first child born in Raymond. In the spring of 1902, people came very fast by rail, or overland with teams and wagons, driving their cattle. This spring was very cold and stormy. During one of these bad storms forty-seven new settlers arrived. It was necessary to house them in the church for ten days while other shelters were being provided. Under the direction of the bishop and Relief Society, with the help of neighbors and friends, they enjoyed cooked meals. KNIGHT SUGAR FACTORY, RAYMOND, CANADA Building completed in 1903, and sugar was manufactured that same year SETTLING RAYMOND, ALBERTA, CANADA 527 THE RAYMOND RELIEF SOCIETY was organized in the lean-to in the back of this building, the home of Emma }. Bevan, February 1902. THE ward was organized on October 10, 1901, with Jesse W. Knight as bishop, and Joseph Bevan and Ephraim Hicks as counselors. Brother McCarthy notified the Bishop of this appointment while he and Mrs. Knight were \"riding the range\" on the \"K-2\" ranch, where they were then living. They moved to Raymond and built a home where young couples were married and many royal guests entertained, among them being President Joseph F. Smith and wife, President Francis M. Lyman, Dr. George H. Brimhall, L. H. Hol-brook, and their wives, some of the apostles and their wives, and other Church and government officials, as well as dear friends and associates. The first couple married by Bishop Knight was Katie Pitt and William Jensen of Salt Lake City. They were at the dedication of the townsite. All of the auxiliary organizations were fortunate in having efficient officers from the beginning. The Relief Society commenced its work early in 1902 under the direction of its president Emma J. Bevan, at whose home it was organized. With Counselors Mary J. Selman and Annie Gibbs, with teachers and members, this thrifty organization did a wonderful work, throughout the years it carried on the traditions of charity, love, and preparedness for which it was organized. The Relief Society erected a granary on its own city lot, which was filled with wheat. Later it owned a quarter section of land on which wheat was raised for the benefit of the Society. HOME OF JESSE WILLIAM KNIGHT First bishop of Raymond The year 1903 marked the completion of the sugar factory, the major activity in all that section of the country at that time. Words fail to express what a Herculean task it was to build and operate a sugar factory in so short a time. The land which was covered with tall grass and \"a million mosquitoes to every blade\" had to be prepared to raise beets for the factory. Men and boys who were not building were ploughing and cultivating the land. Warren Depew, a veteran plowman, reports that 3,000 acres were ready on scheduled time. It took the combined efforts of men. Women, and children, augmented by Indians, Chinese, and itinerant laborers to plant, thin, top, and harvest the beets, as well as 150 to 300 men to build and operate the factory. This enterprise was fortunate in the intelligent personnel of the men who supervised the work. Foremost among them was Ephraim P. Ellison, a man of acute understanding and executive ability-. His posterity-are still builders in the Alberta country. Brother J. William Evans, who remained loyal to Raymond to the end. Was the first supervisor of the beet fields and later held important positions in the factory. Along with all the work the women had to do, it fell to their lot to foster the social functions, as related before. The very first Christmas party was given in the meeting house. Sister Elizabeth King, who is still stake president of YW'MIA, and Sister Lamb decorated the building and the tree, and the appropriate program and dance of that date set a pace worthy to be followed. The pioneers who still remain are unanimous in the opinion expressed by Dr. George H. Brimhall, whose sons and daughters were among the first settlers, that: God from on high lights up the way For man to go that's best, He pro\\ides the opportunity, But man must do the rest.

            "content": "Stay as Sweet as You Are Ada B. Monson JIMMY was leading the way to the far side of the big waiting room. You shouldn't have come, Mother,? he said. ?Train stations are tough assignments for mothers these days.\" Mrs. Leeder started to speak. Jimmy interrupted, \"Don't say it, Mother, I will?\"the tougher the job, the harder you tackle.\" They both laughed and sat down on a long bench. Jimmy put. His suitcase between them on the seat. They both rested their arms on it and Jimmy put his hand over his mother's. \"Seriously, Mother, Fm very grateful for all the sweet philosophy you've dished up for me. I'm gonna need it, but sure.\" Mrs. Leeder tried to smile, but her chin went wobbly. Then to herself?I musn't cry, I musn't cry. I must talk, that's it, I must talk every minute to keep from crying. Boys in khaki and blue were dashing hatless and coatless in and out of the station between trains. \"They keep that girl at the newsstand really busy, and look, Jimmy, there are Fred and his mother coming in now, see, at the middle door?\" Mrs. Leeder stood up to wave at them. Jimmy put out a restraining hand. \"Let's stay here. Mother,\" he said. Mrs. Leeder sat down, \"Why sure?all right,\" she said. \"You'll get to see them out at the train,\" Jimmy said. He's afraid I'll break down in front of them all, she thought, but she said, \"I hope you two boys can stick together through this like you did through growing up.\" \"Can't though. Fred'll go in the air corps,\" Jimmy said. \"Oh, I didn't know. Poor Ruth. She won't have anyone at home, now.\" \"You be sure and call her up, sometimes.\" \"Oh, I will. Son?every day,\" Mrs. Leeder said. Jimmy smiled. \"She'll be calling you up, too.\" Mrs. Leeder smiled back and a lump came in her throat again. Talk fast, talk fast. \"Fred's mother is a beautiful woman, isn't she?\" \"Yeah,\" Jimmy said, \"clothes do an awful lot.\" Mrs. Leeder put her feet further under the seat and straightened up a bit. \"I guess I could have worn my hat,\" she said, smoothing her hair with a workworn hand. \"I've got those gloves you gave me for Christmas, too.\" Never before had she been so aware of her shabbiness, her lack of style. \"You sure you don't want to see Ruth, Son?\" she asked. Jimmy shook his head. \"We said goodbye last night.\" He changed the subject quickly. \"Wonder how I'll look in G. I. Cloth?\" Page  \"You'll look beautiful. Just beautiful? Mrs. Leeder said. They both laughed a little. Then, noticing the sudden activity, they both glanced at the clock. ?It's time, Mother,\" he said. She put out a hand, then quickly drew it back. Already he was standing, his suitcase in his hand. \"No, Mother?don't get up?and don't come out to the train. I'd like it best this way.\" With one fleeting look at her he dashed through the door that led to the trains. Mrs. Leeder's glance followed him until he was lost in the crowd. She sat still on the long bench. It was funny how all alone she felt with so many people around her. At the other end of the room she could see Mrs. Chambers sobbing in Fred's arms. Fred was using his handkerchief on his own eyes, then they went out to the train. After a while, Mrs. Leeder stood up and went out the entrance toward home. Well, anyway, she hadn't cried. She had promised herself she wouldn't cry. But now she could let down if she wanted to. Funny she didn't, seem to be able to shed tears. It had all turned out so differently from the way she had expected. She was sure Jimmy had acted unnatural. He had kept that old suitcase between them so she couldn't take his hand or get close to him. And he didn't kiss her goodbye, or even take her in his arms. A December snow was falling. She buttoned her coat more closely around her. A plate-glass door panel caught her reflection. She paused, then started on?came back and stood still, shoving her hands deep into her coat pockets and straightening her shoulders. Then, after a minute, she hurried on. The picture she had seen wasn't exactly pleasing. Certainly not anything like Mrs. Chambers. Jimmy had said, \"Clothes can do an awful lot.\" Jimmy hadn't wanted to join his friends. Could it be that he was? she wouldn't say it. Jimmy wasn't like that. And yet?something had been wrong. Suddenly she felt hollow inside, an emptiness which she couldn't shake off. That was it? of course it was. She had been so busy making a living for the two of them and getting Jimmy through school for the last five years she just hadn't taken time out to keep herself up. She hadn't been in a beauty shop for?well she couldn't remember. Oh dear! She had let Jimmy down, not purposely, but down, just the same. The wind blew little wisps of hair around her face, and suddenly it seemed colder. She buried her chin and nose down beneath her storm collar and hurried homeward. That's what she needed?home-home and a good cry.  IT was October and Mrs. Leeder entered the depot and walked over to the train schedule. Number Twenty-Six was due at nine o'clock. It was eight now. She stopped a redcap. \"Can you tell me when Number Twenty-Six comes in from San Francisco?\" she asked. \"Nine o'clock, Mam,\" he said. She thanked him and walked to the far end of the waiting room. She placed one foot slightly back of the other one and sat down gracefully. Martin leaned back, she thought, always keep the back perfectly straight, shoulders relaxed. One of the beauty lessons had said, \"Always choose chairs with a firm seat, or the knees might collide with the chin.\" Well, this seat was firm enough, and it was on this same seat that a mother had said goodbye to her son last December. And now, after almost a year, she was here to meet him, with one hour to wait.\nYes, she had been the mother, but a very different one. That mother wore a coat that slapped her legs too far below the knees; had straight hair pinned in a tight knot at the back of her neck, and broken nails; she had also had the analgesic not to wear a hat or gloves.\nShe recalled words from lesson twenty-seven: \"Street clothes should be chosen with utmost care. Suits are best, and careful attention must be paid to accessories.\"\nA little smile played about her lips as she slowly and nonchalantly tugged at the glove on her left hand. She removed only one. She wanted to admire again her long lacquered nails. Leisurely she worked the fingers back into the soft kid. Underneath her tailored suit her heart was racing. She glanced at the clock. Forty-five more minutes to wait for Jimmy. Would he like her? He'd be surprised, she knew. Maybe he wouldn't know her with her? He'd be surprised, she knew. hat with bright feathers right smack on the top. She was all of an inch taller in these new shoes, too.\nPretty minutes to go!\nShe just couldn't sit there that long, she'd have to move about. The place hadn't changed much in a year?the same clanging of trains and the same calling of trains, except that now the voice came from a loudspeaker overhead. Everywhere, boys in khaki and blue rushed in to buy magazines, candy, and postcards, then dashed out to get on their trains.\nMrs. Leeder found herself moving with them out to the platform. Soon a long train slowed to a stop. She noticed a neatly dressed woman in a fur coat and red-feathered hat glancing anxiously up and down; white dozens of men in uniform spilled out of the cars. A smooth-faced sailor with a cane and a slight limp detached himself from the crowd and hurried toward the woman. \"Mother!\" he exclaimed, \"I hardly knew you.\" He clasped her in his arms.\n\"Boy?your coat. Mother, can you still afford mink with a war going on?\" He laughed and patted her arm. \"But I love you anyway. Mother. Gosh, is this black hair a wig, or does it wash out? I liked your hair with gray in it. But of course you are glamorous.\" He squeezed her again and guided her laughingly through the crowd. Mrs. Leeder watched them disappear.\nFinally she came to the end of the platform and automatically turned and started walking back. She thought she knew what the boy had meant when he had referred to his mother's mink coat. He had tried to laugh it off but he hadn't liked her hair, either. It was awfully black for such a wrinkled face. Mrs. Leeder guessed the boys liked to find things the same when they came back from the war. And now she was glad she hadn't rearranged the furniture or moved the rose garden. And jolly well glad she was that she didn't have a new fur coat to plague her. Yes, she felt cozy in the thought that Jim would find everything about the same. The same? She ran her gloved hand up the back of her neck. Those loose locks on an up-sweep were so annoying! Up-sweep! And her hat was a monstrosity, so her boss had said. But then, men didn't know anything about women's hats. But it was more than that. Her nails were so long she'd given up playing the piano months ago. Mrs. Leeders' heart did a drop act. She ran inside and looked at the clock. Eighteen minutes to go. Like one pursued, she ran to the ladies' lounge. Behind a screen she found a dressing table and a chair. Frantically she tore off her hat,\"\" pulled out combs from her hair. A big black face appeared around the screen. \"Ah's Mandy,\" it said. \"You all seemed in such a powah-ful hurry. Cain I do somp'in foah you all?\" Mrs. Leeder's heart came back into place for the first time in minutes. \"Oh, Mandy,\" she exclaimed, \"Never again will I doubt that prayers are answered. If you can lengthen this skirt two inches in ten minutes, you can name your price. Just baste it in, of course.\" Mrs. Leeder was already slipping it off. \"Ah'11 be right back, quick as scat,\" Mandy said, and left with the skirt over her arm. Mrs. Leeder studied herself for a second in the mirror. She hurriedly wiped off the heavy print of lipstick, leaving just enough, then turned her attention to her hair. She ran her comb through it several times, until it fell glistening to her shoulders. Then deftly she pushed the soft waves loosely around her face and wound the length into a low bob on her neck. Then, with a nail file she set to work on her nails. Surely, swiftly, in no time at all, she had filed away the sharp claws, rounding the ends and smoothing them off. \"Heah's you' skirt. Ma'am, and right on de dot a ten minutes,\" Mandy said, holding the skirt toward her. \"Oh, thanks. Thanks, Mandy,\" Mrs. Leeder said, \"help me pull it on, will you? It can't go on over my head, or my hair will be mussed. There. I'll fasten it. Run, see the time, please,\" slipping her a quarter. Mrs. Leeder finished dressing and hurried out to the platform, and stood among others who were waiting. From far away came the long, lonesome whistle of Number Twenty-Six. Everyone suddenly stood at attention, looking down the long track to where it curved out of sight. Mrs. Leeder thought, it won't be long now. Her stomach did a flip-flop. Again the whistle gave vent to two longs, one short, and a long, and soon the train came in, its engine puffing and panting. Mrs. Leeder's feet seemed glued to the platform. How could anyone see all the cars at once? She decided to stand in one place, near the main entrance. Then, if she didn't see Jimmy, he would see her after the crowd had thinned out.\nBut after a little while when the crowd had thinned out, and still no Jimmy, Mrs. Leeder grew anxious. Could it be that Jimmy had missed his train? There was another one due from the Coast in about nine minutes. But the telegram had said he would be on Number Twenty-Six.\nThere were two soldiers standing a little way down the platform. Maybe they could tell her something, she thought, as she started over to where they stood. One was bareheaded, and wearing dark glasses.\nThey were looking at her now and walking toward her.\n\"Why?that boy's hair is like Jimmy's!\" she thought, but he didn't look like?yes, he did. It was the dark glasses that had puzzled her. It was funny!?Oh, Jimmy?Jimmy couldn't see. Her fast strides broke into a run, and then her arms were about him, holding him tight, tight.\nShe wanted to say so many things. She wanted to tell him it didn't matter. But not a sound would come for years. She just could only press them tight together and pray for it it had been important that she keep from crying when he went away, it was doubly so now.\nShe felt his fingers exploring her face, then her hair, and the loose softness must have confused him?then crinkly the eager fingers sought and found the low bob at the back of her neck. A smile relieved the sternness of his mouth. \"It's all right, Lieutenant,\" he said, turning to the soldier. \"This is my mother. Thanks for standing by me.\" He held out his hand and the Lieutenant shook it warmly, lifted his cap to Mrs. Leeder, then hastily left them.\nGuiding Jimmy carefully through the station, she called a cab and they got in.\n\"That was Lieutenant Conrey. He's swell. On the train I told him about you. I said, 'You'll know my mother. She maybe won't be wearing a hat or gloves, and she combs her hair awful plain and wears it in a little knot on the back of her head.' Gosh, Mother, he knew you right off?\"\nMrs. Leeder leaned over and laid her cheek against his.\n\"Oh, Jimmy,\" she said."

To one remembering moon-drenched desert range, This forest land is beautiful.... But strange. Sixt Years J4go Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, September 1, and September 15, 1885 \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women OF All Nations\" Home: It has been very wisely remarked that in order to fully appreciate the blessings and comforts of life, it is necessary for a person to be described of them for a time. Who can so much appreciate the cheerful home fireside, the association with parents and friends, as those who have been separated from them for a season, and called to face the hard, cruel world alone, away from the kind, cheerful faces and helping hands of the loved ones? Home is the haven of rest to which we flee when the day's work is done What is so cheerful a sight as to see fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters surrounding the bright and cheerful hearth, each happy in the other's love, and all contented with their lot.... Where there is disorder and confusion the spirit of God cannot abide.... It is said, and reason and reflection corroborate the statement, that \"order is heaven's first law.\" So also should it be the first law of the home. Note: With a tender remembrance of that magnificent woman Helen Hunt Jackson, of Colorado Springs, we record her demise.... Mrs. Jackson wrote over the signature of H. H. And is widely known as a journalist of rare merit. Her last book is entitled \"Ramona\" and has been spoken of by critics and reviewers as the best novel by an American woman,... During her two visits in this city we had many interesting conversations, and she expressed herself always as intensely interested in all religions, especially anything new or original and when it most concerned women. Excerpts from a letter written from Almo, Cassia County, Idaho, by Hannah T. King: I have a few words to say about this remote region.... First, it is a wild but beautiful country, the atmosphere seems the very breath of heaven; so clear, pure, cool and invigorating, even in these dog days! The inhabitants are so widely separated, that nothing but love and joy are exhibited when they meet;... The spirit of the place breathes of peace and goodwill. Freedom and liberty reign supreme.... On Thursday I attended the first Relief Society held in this region.... There was a sweet, even childlike spirit in that first meeting! Each felt desirous to do her part, yet felt her inefficiency to carry out the desires of her heart; but everyone must have realized the Spirit of God was in that meeting. Don't we look back, as we ascend, Over the journey clear to the end? Cannot we see, though our eyes are dim, All of the past unknown to them?, Cannot we feel we are drawing near Those who are gone to the higher sphere? Nearer the treasures we lost long ago? They are above, and not below. ?E. Stephens Music: There is great power in music! Among the fine arts this has the strongest effect upon human character.... Who has not had his heart melted into tenderness and the fountain of his tears broken up by some touching appeal of melody.... And at church, what will concentrate the minds of the audience on God more than a beautiful hymn or anthem? Page 534"

            "content": "Regular Weekly Relief Society Meetings Begin for 1945-46 Season \nTHE month of October marks the beginning of regular weekly Relief Society meetings for the 1945-46 season. Beginnings are always interesting. They represent a space or period of time at which action is taken in the fulfillment of dreams or in the realization of plans, many of which have been long in the making. Beginnings are accompanied by all sorts of reactions on the part of persons identified with them. Some approach them with enthusiasm, full of faith in that which has been initiated, and determined that the outcome will be successful and glorious. Others are skeptical, approaching them with doubt and criticism, seeing errors in judgment, weakness in plans, and insurmountable obstacles in the way of fulfillment. Still others are passive or indifferent toward beginnings, taking them much for granted and little concerned with their own responsibility toward that which has been started.\nOne cannot always judge the outcome of a beginning by its auspiciousness. Often beginnings which to all but a few seem of little import are proved by time to be of greatest moment, defining objectives, introducing activities, setting patterns that touch the lives of tens of thousands and that exert a profound influence in the forward march of society. Such was the case 103 years ago when eighteen Latter-day Saint women were organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith \"under the Priesthood and after the pattern of the Priesthood\" to \"look to the wants of the poor, search after objects of charity, and administer to their wants, ... to assist by correcting the morals and strengthening the virtues of the community.\" These sisters were early taught the proper relationship to their husbands, and their position in the home was an integral part of gospel teachings.\nWomen, young and mature, were quickly drawn toward the new institution. Forty-four new members came into the Society at the second meeting. Something had been initiated that appealed to all.\nToday, 102,000 women are awaiting the beginning of the regular weekly meetings for the 1945-46 season. The objective as set forth by the Prophet will be adhered to carefully, adapted to present-day conditions and in line with present-day Church procedures.\nWelfare work will receive a great deal of our time, with full support being given to the Church Welfare Plan. Concern for neighbors will be emphasized. Page 536 EDITORIAL 537 WE must \"cherish\" one another, and graciously and willingly render service that will bring comfort and happiness into the lives of one another. Homemaking, too, will receive special emphasis during the coming season. It is the duty of Relief Society to train women to be skilled housekeepers and good homemakers. Attendance at Relief Society should give women an enlarged vision of the importance of maintaining their homes according to Latter-day Saint standards. Officers are urged to enlist young women as members of the Society, and to interpret and conduct the program so that it will attract them and meet their needs. The Latter-day Saint viewpoint and the spirit of the gospel should characterize all that is done in Relief Society, and the testimony of the truth of the restored gospel should be strengthened in every woman attending. Let us each resolve to be among those who approach the beginning of this season's work with enthusiasm, full of faith in that which has been initiated, and determined that the outcome of the year's work will be successful and glorious. -B. S. S. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES \"Other misfortunes may be borne, or their effects overcome. If disastrous wars should sweep our commerce from the ocean, another generation may renew it; if it exhaust our treasury, future industry may replenish it; if it desolate and lay waste our fields, still, under a new cultivation, they will grow green again, and ripen to future harvests. \"It were but a trifle even if the walls of yonder Capitol were to crumble, if its lofty pillars should fall, and its gorgeous decorations be all covered by the dust of the valley. All these may be rebuilt. \"But who shall reconstruct the fabric oi demolished government? \"Who shall rear again the well-proportioned columns of constitutional liberty? \"Who shall frame together the skillful architecture which unites national sovereignty with State rights, individual security, and public prosperity? \"No, if these columns fall, they will be raised not again. Like the Coliseum and the Parthenon, they will be destined to a mournful and a melancholy immortality. Bitterer tears, however, will flow over them than were ever shed over the monuments of Roman or Grecian art; for they will be the monuments of a more glorious edifice than Greece or Rome ever saw, the edifice of constitutional American liberty.\" ?Daniel Webster, \"Eulogy on General Washington,\" (1832)."

            "content": "Notes TO THE FIELD Auxiliary Regional Meetings and Monthly Union Meetings Authorized COPIES of the following letter \"Further Instructions Regarding Conventions and Union Meetings\" over the signature of the First Presidency of the Church were mailed to Relief Society stake presidents. It is reprinted herewith for the information of Relief Society officers: July 16, 1945 To Church Officers, Dear Brethren and Sisters: Further Instructions Regarding Conventions and Union Meetings Because of limitations set on automotive travel, the General Church Authorities on January 17, 1942, speaking through the First Presidency, advised General Boards of Auxiliary Organizations to discontinue the holding of monthly Union meetings, Institutes, and Conventions. Later, the Government itself placed a limitation upon assemblies throughout the entire country. The suspension of Unions and Conventions, of course, made less effective direct contact of Stake Boards as such with wards and branch officers and teachers, but placed greater responsibility upon the ward and branch organizations. We commend the local officers and teachers upon their willingness, ability, and increased effort to guide and instruct the members of their respective organizations during this Page 538 critical war-time period. It is gratifying, indeed, to note how efficiently the quorums and auxiliary organizations have functioned notwithstanding the limitations and difficulties under which they have had to labor. Occasional visits by General Board members to wards, stakes and districts requesting special help have contributed to increased efficiency in class work and in general spiritual uplift. A recent ruling by the Office of Price Administration, increasing the amount of gasoline for \"A\" coupons seems to point to such a relaxation with regard to the use of gasoline as will permit additional travel. Accordingly, we now authorize the holding of monthly priesthood leadership meetings that may include quorum members who may be especially invited to attend these meetings, monthly priesthood meetings, auxiliary regional meetings, and monthly union meetings where any such meetings may be held without violating the restrictions regarding the use of gasoline and rubber, and where the holding of such meetings will not interfere with quarterly conferences or other regularly established meetings. However, we do not, by these amended instructions, intend to authorize nor to countenance the holding of any of these meetings under circumstances which involve the violation of governmental rules and regulations regarding travel either by automobile or otherwise. NOTES TO THE FIELD 539 In this connection, we point out that experiences during the exigencies of war indicate that the visits of stake board members to wards produce even better results than having local officers and teachers travel to a central place for a monthly union meeting. Youth Need Guidance And Supervision In moving thus early to lift the ban hitherto placed upon the holding of Conventions and Union meetings, we are obedient to the necessity for close cooperation and personal contact between general and stake officers, and the young people of the Church. Every means that will foster such association must be made available wherever and whenever possible. The proper guidance of our children and youth is one of our paramount responsibilities. We are looking to those who represent the General Authorities in Priesthood and in Auxiliary work to discharge this responsibility in sincerity and prayerful devotion. Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence. He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand. Even so. Amen. Sincerely your brethren, George Albert Smith J. Reuben Clark, Jr. David O. McKay The First Presidency Ward Relief Society Conferences, November 4, 1945 CONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on Fast Sunday evenings, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evenings of Fast Day in November and March. Fast Day in November this year will occur November 4, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the annual ward Relief Society conference. Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of Fast Day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society conference, coming as it does only one month after the opening of the regular weekly meetings in October, thus affording opportunity for previewing the lessons and other work, near the beginning of the educational season. It is recommended: 1. That each ward conference be attended by a representative of the stake board who should be present at both the officers' meeting and the general session. 2. That each conference consist of  two meetings? a. An officers' meeting to be attended by the ward executive officers, special workers and class leaders, the ward bishop or his representative, and the visiting stake board member.\nb. A general session for all Relief Society members and for the general membership of the ward.\nThe purposes of the officers' meeting are to discuss special problems confronting the ward Relief Society, and to provide opportunity for the stake board member to evaluate the condition of the ward Society and to advise, instruct, and stimulate the ward officers. In order to accomplish the purposes of the meeting, some stakes prepare a questionnaire or present and discuss data from the last annual report. At least one hour should be allowed for this meeting and, in some instances, a longer period may be required. The time for holding the officers' meeting is optional with wards, but should be at a time convenient for the visiting stake board member and bishop. For example, this meeting may be held immediately preceding the general session, as heretofore\nsuggested, the previous evening, or at some other time convenient for the bishop and visiting board member. This officers' meeting, held in connection with the ward conference, may constitute the monthly ward preparation meeting for the month in which the conference is held.\nIn order to insure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that advance announcement of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members particularly should be urged to attend.\nA suggestive program for use at ward conference will be sent to ward and stake presidents in bulletin form. Its use is optional and stakes and wards desiring to plan their own programs may do so. However, the General Board is very anxious that this meeting be used to acquaint ward members with the work of Relief Society and also with a view to enlisting the active participation of the women of the ward.

            "content": "Beyond This Dorothy Clapp Rohinson THE car was cruising effortlessly. It was a rare morning and a rare scene. Peaks of mountains and barbs of lava etched jagged holes through a downy quilt of shifting rain clouds. The scent of wet earth and green sage crept through the open window. In the back seat Mary Evans quivered with nostalgia. \"It's camouflage,? she whispered to herself. \"Cruel, selfish camouflage.\" The desert stretched before them with blue mountains for a backdrop. The soft rain came, then passed and came again. Quiescent, the mood of the travelers softened. Only Mary stiffened. '*We should be home by five o'clock.\" Home. These carefree people, Mr. McCollum, his wife and daughter, Patricia, would be home. Mary no longer had a home. Home meant a family and love and dreams. It meant building for the future. Her future lay behind. A roaring filled the sky. Between cloud puffs three bombers appeared flying in formation. The car stopped while the driver watched. \"That's the life,\" he sighed. \"Those kids are lucky.\" \"Lucky.\" Mary spat the word. The girl beside her laid a hand gently on her knee but Mary moved. The hand was withdrawn. To these people war meant honor and glory. It even made them kind to their seamstress. They had brought her on this trip thinking it would make her forget. As if there were such a thing as forgetting. A quick smothered sob made her turn quickly, but Patricia's face was turned away. Gene had been the son every mother thinks she has. Strong, rugged, yet as full of dreams as a girl. \"Don't you worry. Mom,\" he had said so many times. \"Some day people are going to point to you and say, 'Know what? That's Gene Evan's mother. And you will swell with pride and I will tell the whole world the kind of mother you have been. And I'll pay the mortgage and buy new furniture. How's that?\" \"Perfect.\" Mary never doubted he would do just that. Gene had what it took to make dreams come true. The bombers passed and the car started again. Mary stared unseeing at the rocks and brush. It was such a little way back to his boyhood. \"Know what?\" he had asked once in a burst of confidence. He had finished mowing McCollum's lawn and they were sitting on their own back steps. The softness of a spring evening filled the dusk about them. \"No. What?\" \"Some day after I go away and make my fortune, I'll come winging back out of the clouds in a big shining ship. I'll set her down over there on that vacant lot and everybody will come running to see. Page  Pat will be there, too. I'll be big then and strong, and I will pick her up in my arms and while everybody is watching we will fly away into the? into the land of Shining Mountains. DREAMS. Sweet dreams of youth. Their ending was of the essence of their birth. He had gone winging into the Shining Mountains, but Patricia was here and all the dreams had been for nothing. Mary had tried desperately to make the years less hard. Her efforts had been but fumbling beside the directness of his purpose. He had grown tall, hard of muscle and keen of eye. Handsome fellow, people said, and drew their daughters away. He would be like his dad. Mary knew better. From first grade on he'd had eyes for one girl only, Patricia McCollum, the untouchable. But his pride was as fierce as his strength. Mary glanced briefly at the girl, then looked again. She was staring ahead, her face a study in alabaster, hands motionless in her lap. Compelled by Mary's gaze she turned. Her mind came back slowly from long distances. There was something baffling in her eyes. Was it pity. Mary would have no pity. For herself or Gene. Oh, especially not for Gene. How he had managed flying lessons she never knew. It seemed impossible to add one more hour to his day. But he had. Then those flying lessons had suddenly become the important thing in his life?in all life. At twenty-one he had put aside the dreams of youth for the grim business of war. Mary tried to shut her mind to that first parting. He had stood on the back porch a long time staring in the direction of the imposing McCollum home, but he left without going over. Patricia had come the next day and if her eyes were bleak with sympathy, well, Mary's were bleak, too. She was left with only memories. The car picked up speed. The landscape became wilder, more stark. Was it like this in Greenland, she wondered? He'd been there the last year. He had written so few details. Don't worry, Mom. Our huts are warm, and we can take it. I am getting a leave the next time we hit the mainland. I hope it will be soon. There is nothing in all the world like the feel of good old U. S. Soil under a punk's feet. Nothing unless it is the sight of his Mom or his best girl. I'll come winging out of the clouds as I promised. And I am getting Pat this trip. Do you think she will spare me a week? I have learned basic values up here, and I am going to tell her what I should have told her long ago. But he hadn't asked Patricia to spare a week from her busy comfortable life. He had never whispered the wild sweet love that had been his secret dream through the years. In quick thought Mary turned, and wondered at the nakedness of the girl's face. Why?why it hadn't been pity. Patricia had been in love with him. She would have gone winging with him into the unknown. That explained so many little things. Mary sickened a little. The knowledge would have meant so much to Gene. It would have meant fulfilment to him. Now he would never know?or had he known? Of course. That. Explained what he had said about basic values. Her lips set stubbornly. Patricia had never known want or an unfulfilled desire. Let her suffer as Gene had suffered. In all her life Mary had had just her son. She was not sharing him now.\nShe had worked night and day to prepare for his coming. Her few carefully hoarded dollars had gone for paint and wallpaper. The money he sent home she was saving for him. She had changed her bed to his room. Maybe he would not recognize it under its coat of paint. She wanted him to have the best of everything.\nAnd then?and then the very day he was to have arrived there came a cablegram instead. \"Lost in performance of duty.\" A month?a long, long month?during which Patricia had stood by, white-faced, tight-lipped. How blinded Mary had been by her own suffering. A moment ended by a letter. His plane had been found. He and all his crew had been buried at an advance base, whatever that meant.\nYes, after all Mary did know what it meant. It meant empty, desolate years. It meant the end of the world. It meant the end of planning?and that Patricia would never know.\nThe rain clouds lifted and the rocks grew hot. They stopped at the Craters of the Moon. It had been very kind of the McCollums to bring her on this trip but she wished they would not stop so often. She watched impatiently while the driver paid an entrance fee and received instructions. More impatiently she saw him turn the car onto a road where no road should ever be. It lead into lava flows once spewed white-hot from a dragon's\nmouth. Immediately her impatience vanished. For the first time in months she was interested. The bleakness and blackness found echo in her heart.\nWeird, uncanny formations, terrifying in their stark nakedness, were sharply etched, as yet untouched by the raging power of time and the elements. Rising from the confusion, were several sharply sloping cones of coal-black pulverized cinders.\nSomething was rising unbidden in Mary. Something akin to justification. How like LIFE this barren waste was, bleak, impotent and utterly without form or purpose. Of no earthly use to God or man.\nThey rounded a quick turn and stopped abruptly. Leaving the car they stood at the edge of the road gazing in awe and bewilderment.\nHEAVEN had laid a fleece of beauty over stark sterility. Every slope of every black hill was covered with a carpet of flowers. Wild snowballs, Gene had called them. From between two slender silver leaves a stem rose, topped by a snowball the size of a large marble. The balls graduated in color from pale canary through orange, to crimson.\nUnbelievably, there was a tiny orchard of these among them. A Heaven by Gardener not only had planted, but had spaced them. Looking from any direction there were perfect rows with plants four inches apart. Silver, yellow, orchid, crimson, and, underneath, the rimming black lace of cinders. It was a miracle. The ash of black despair had given birth to HOPE, beautiful beyond compare.\nAt Patricia's gasp, Mary turned to face her. Tears were streaming unheeded down the girl's cheeks. This was the girl Gene had loved, who loved him; and there must be no despair. Patricia's must not be denied her. Mary took the girl's hand. \"He meant to tell you,\" she whispered. \"That is why he was coming home.\""

            "content": "Planning For Safety THE great number of accidents occurring in the homes of America has intensified research into their causes. It has been found that many accidents are due to faulty home design, unsafe equipment, and careless actions. If the greatest degree of safety is to be obtained, careful consideration must be given to the elimination of hazards which are known to produce accidents. This may require changes in the house plan, rearrangement of the. Furniture, provision of places for putting things away, or the addition of more light to entrances, passages, and stairways. The National Safety Council tells us that falls cause about two-thirds of all home tragedies. All stairs should have an easy ascent with equal step heights or rises and treads of equal width. Sturdy hand rails should be provided. Good lighting is essential and may be secured by placing a switch at both the top and the bottom of the stairs. There should be non-slip floor surfaces and well-secured carpeting. Loose metal step guards or small throw rugs are malicious hazards. Rooms with floor levels of varying heights?a step up to the dining room or one down to the living room?are a constant danger. Any door opening into a hall should swing roomward and should not open directly on a down stairway. If this arrangement cannot be avoided, a safety lock should be placed on the door to give time for realization of a potential fall. Overhead obstructions should be removed or painted white, especially in the basement and attic stairways. Top and bottom steps, when painted white, will indicate when the end is reached. A gate to bar the stairs is essential if there are toddlers around. The bathroom is often the scene of falls, scalds, and burns if the equipment is not arranged to prevent them. The tub should have a flat bottom with at least one strong, solid grip on the wall to hold on to when getting in and out of the tub or shower. There should be a non-slip mat on the floor and a good container should be provided to keep soap out of the way. The water should be kept below scalding, about 125? Fahrenheit. Records tell of fatal results to children from too hot water being turned on them. Electric switches should be placed outside the bathroom or beyond reach of the tub or shower. Never touch an electrical appliance with wet hands. Many older people, as well as children, die from falls and burns in bedrooms. There should be light fixtures at both doors and bedsides. See that there is a straight path from the bed to the door to avoid bumping or falling over furniture. Children should be provided with safe cribs having the slats close enough to prevent the baby's head Page  being caught between them. Be sure that children's furniture and toys are painted with non-poisonous compounds. Reliable dealers should know the ingredients of their paints. Radiant heaters should be placed away from materials that could be ignited, and heating pads should be placed away from materials that could be ignited, and heating pads should be kept in good repair to prevent burns.\nWindows need careful consideration. If they can be arranged to swing or turn in for cleaning, a very definite falling hazard will be eliminated, as sitting or leaning out of windows to wash them is dangerous. Screens and storm windows should be adjusted from the inside and the catches on all screens should be strong and secure.\nThe roof design of a home should be kept simple and the attic well insulated to eliminate the necessity of removing snow and ice from the eaves and gutters in heavy winter weather.\nMake the living room livable by grouping the furniture where it will be most used, leaving clear paths for family traffic. Provide enough electric plug-ins to eliminate the necessity for long cords which may be tripped over or broken. Sew weights or rubber fruit rings on the under side of rugs to keep them flat and secure them from slipping or tripping. Use non-skid wax on the floors.\nThe kitchen is the most dangerous room in the house. Children should be kept out while cooking or canning is going on. All equipment should be kept in good repair. Shelves should be placed within reach, or where this cannot be done, a sturdy stepladder with wide treads or \"step stool\" should be used. Stoves with an open flame should not be closer than twelve to eighteen inches from a window. Curtains should be securely fastened so they won't blow over the flame and ignite. All floors, walls, and chimneys should be properly insulated from heating stoves. Matches and all sharp instruments should be put away from little fingers.\nMore than half of the home accidents happen outside the home. Provide adequate light for porch steps and walks. If paths cannot be cleaned from snow and ice, they should be sprinkled with salt or ashes. Clean rain gutters will form fewer icicles. Clothes lines should be arranged higher than the head or placed out of the line of traffic.\nTake advantage of foresight and planning to prevent home tragedies. Good housekeeping is safe housekeeping.Therefore,... See that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again. For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored (Alma 41:14-15)."

            "content": "His First Teacher Mildred Y. Hunt ONE of the ever-increasing wonders of my world is the capacity of the child mind for receiving impressions. In his quest for learning he is inexhaustible. In the beginning, his questions were very simple and the main problem was framing replies in language that he could understand. Day by day his interest has widened and with it my responsibility, for I must weave the type of fabric which I desire to be the basis of his future education. This is a part of motherhood in which I have always believed, but not until my own child reached this stage did its possibilities rise before me in such limitless proportions. The impressions made now, upon virgin soil, will take root and live to shape the conduct of his entire life. That which concerns me most at this stage is the foundation of religion. I feel certain that the responsibility for this belongs essentially to me, rather than to those who teach him outside of home. Their contribution will help, but mine is the task of building the main structure. Sunday School and Primary lessons will be more beneficial if he has a background of religious knowledge. It is well that repetition does not bore him, for each retelling strengthens his knowledge and widens his understanding. The characters of the Bible are real and interesting. He never tires of hearing about Jesus and all the incidents and happenings that bring out the beauty and purity of his life. Joseph Smith, too, lives for him in all his nobility. Adam, Enoch, and Noah, the stories of Joseph and the enslavement of the children of Israel, and their delivery by Moses are as interesting to him as any characters of fiction. This is the wonderful thing about teaching him, for once the child's interest is gained the teacher's work is easy and pleasurable. Our Church leaders have stressed the importance of early training for children. According to President Grant: The Lord has said that it is our duty to teach our children in their youth. Children are not born with a knowledge of the gospel. Each one must learn and study and gain that knowledge for himself. Brigham Young was very explicit in his direction to mothers: Let mothers commence to teach their children while in their laps; there do you teach them to love the Lord and keep his commandments.... If you, mothers, will live your religion, then in the love and fear of God teach your children constantly and thoroughly in the ways of life and salvation, training them up in the way they should go, and when they are old they will not depart from it. If we do not take the pains to train our children, to teach and \" instruct them concerning these revealed truths, the condemnation will be upon us as parents. Page 547 The value of family prayers in training children for religious and spiritual lives cannot be over estimated. Sincerity and humility on the part of the parents seeking the spirit of the Lord in the home is one of the first profound impressions to be made on young minds.\nIt is easy to let less important tasks crowd out these essential activities. One of the most potent weapons of the adversary is procrastination. Our lives today move at a rapid tempo, but it is more important than ever that we remain calm, and hold fast to the enduring and everlasting principles of the salvation of souls.\nfor us but also for our children. Not one of the tasks constantly tugging at us is important enough to justify neglect of the great trust which is ours in the training of these little ones.\nAnd so, of the two precious years that remain before I give him over to others to teach, there is no time to waste. In studying for the information which I must have in order to meet this goal, I, too, shall be immeasurably benefited. We shall share a rich and happy experience together which we shall be better able to give to others."

Many people, young and old, traveled along the Highway, for it was the Road of Life. This is a tale of two men who journeyed thereon.\nNow, there was a legend in the Beautiful Kingdom that when a man had traversed the Highway's length, even unto the shores of the Silver Sea, the Radiant One would take him by the hand, and lead him into an enchanted land, where his eyes would behold things too beautiful for mortal men to look upon. None had ever returned to tell of its wonder, for the law was that a traveler walked that way but once.\nIt was springtime when Jan and Justin began their pilgrimage. All the earth was made fair and lovely by the silvery sunshine that fell from happy skies. Birds and flowers grew in rich abundance, and birds' celestial music filled the air like a blessed benediction.\nJan was in ecstasy. Nothing, he thought, could be as beautiful as this; no, not even the vision of the Radiant One.\nEach day, each hour, brought new delight to his soul, and his feet tarried along the trail until Justin became impatient.\n\"Hurry,\" he would call to Jan,\n\"these are only flowers and trees and birds which we can see every day. Why linger among these common things? Let us not stop until we have reached the Silver Sea.\"\nHe would have hastened ahead, but he could not, for it had been decreed that they journey together. He complained bitterly when Jan delayed while they listened to the rustling of moonlit pines.\n\"Angel whispers, they are,\" he told Justin, but Justin could only hear the branches scraping one against the other, and he fretted to be on his way, until his heart became filled with worry and resentment.\nSummer came, and passed; then autumn and the earth was more beautiful than it had been in the springtime. To Jan, each scarlet leaf became a miracle, each golden tree more exquisite than the last, and where green fields had lain in lazy loveliness, now abundant harvests gave the promise of royal riches to all men. But Justin's impatience waxed more strong.\n\"The nights are becoming chill,\" he complained, \"it will soon be winter, and it is still a far journey to the Silver Sea.\"\n\"Yes, I know the nights are chill,\" said Jan, \"but the stars hang low and close like diamonds upon earth's pure breast, and I would drink of this beauty while I can, for we will pass this way but once.\" So they tarried until the winter of life was upon them, and their footsteps faltered many times, for their bodies were tired from their long journeying. They knew now that they would soon reach the Silver Sea, and Justin inlaid his companion bitterly.\n\"See,\" he said, \"you have wasted our strength and time along the way on transient trifles. Our eyes are dim with age. Tell me, how can we now see the Radiant One?\"\nAnd Jan replied, \"I am glad for the experiences of the springtime, for summer's clouds and showers, for the recompense of the harvest. These things have given me power to understand the immenity of that which is to come.\"\nThen the day came when they stepped beyond the sunset into the Silver Sea. With eager, expectant eyes they looked for the Radiant One, as the legend had told them.\nJustin spoke first. \"We are too late, or we have missed our way. This is only another sea, like the many we have passed, and I do not\nI see a person standing in the sun.\"\nBut Jan did not hear, for his ears were filled with the chant of angel choirs, his eyes were filled with the beauty that was too great for mortal man to look upon. His soul stood singing, for it knew the ecstasy of immortality, the glory and the joy of heavenly things, the wonder of eternity.\nThe Radiant One took him by the hand.\n\"Only those who have known me as they journeyed along the way of life can see me here. I walk with all men, but there are those who will not see and some who will not hear. Blessed are you, Jan, for you have seen me in the sunrise, and in the sacred silence of a higher noon; have known me when I manifested myself in acts of kindness by fellow travelers.

Front row, left to right: Mary Carpenter, Second Counselor; Ethelind Carpenter, President; Elvira Mellor, recently released First Counselor. South Sanpete Stake (Utah) ELVIRA MELLOR, former first counselor, Manti Center Ward Relief Society, reports an anniversary program held Tuesday, March 13, 1945. The theme was \"Relief Society, Keeper of the Golden Key.\" A character representing Emma Hale, the first to hold the Golden Key, gave a brief summary of events at the initial organization and led in singing \"The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning.\" \"Charity\" was introduced who spoke of her part in Relief Society. Then \"Music\" told of the benefits she adds to the organization. A character depicting Emmeline B. Wells explained woman's educational privileges attained through Relief Society and told of the study courses instituted during her presidency. A stake board member then gave her interpretation of Relief Society's future frontiers. The majesty and power of Relief Society cannot be measured; no one but God alone can determine the treasured heights of love, the breadth of charity, or sound the depths of knowledge. The scope of our work, the possibilities of our development, are bounded only by woman's capacities and eventualities. The Relief Society is as broad as eternity, as far-reaching as love, and holds the Golden Key for richer blessings above. South Los Angeles Stake (Calif.) SISTER MAUDE McOMIE, second counselor in the South Los Angeles Stake Relief Society, reports the following unusual program: \"Commemorating the one-hundred and third birthday and anniversary on March 7th, the South Los Angeles Stake Relief Society arranged an unique affair. ?To put on a program in the stake house would not be unusual, and with the thought of our war mothers, their anguish of soul for their sons and husbands, we wanted to do something for them, to reach out a kindly hand and have them feel and realize our love for them. This could not be done individually, but collectively we could convey, in a measure, some gesture that would be fitting and appropriate to honor these women. With this in mind, we remembered the beautiful window The Last Supper' at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. What a beautiful setting it would make for a program! They could view the window, listen, and think of the sacrifice Christ made for them. In contemplating the greatness of this sacrifice they could derive comfort in knowing that he understood the suffering of their hearts. \"Out of this grew the following program: Welcome Mrs. Blanche M. Johnson \"The Holy City\" by Stephen Adams Hyrum J. Christiansen, tenor Invocation Mr. W. W. LeCheminant \"Meditation\" from Thais by Jules Massenet Merwin Waite, violinist The Story of \"The Last Supper\" Window Mr. James Herron, narrator \"In the Desert of Waiting\" by Annie Fellows Johnson Mrs. Erma Peterite, dramatic reader \"In the Garden\" by C. Austin Miles Mr. Christiansen Tribute to War Mothers and Wives President Noble Waite Benediction Mrs. Lillian Collings Taps Mrs. Glenna Nelson \"The setting alone was a glorious sight, and something that mere words cannot describe. \"At the conclusion of the program each gold-star mother was presented with a corsage, a token of love from the stake board. Following this, the haunting beauty of taps echoed through the beautiful 'Court of Honor Building'.\" Mt. Graham Stake (Arizona) TRELLA ELLSWORTH, President of Layton Ward Relief Society, and Clare K. Claridge, Secretary of Mt. Graham Stake Relief Society, wrote in April of this year: \"The Layton Ward Relief Society of the Mt. Graham Stake celebrated the March 17 anniversary with a banquet for the mothers and daughters of the ward. There were about 150 present and among them a family of four generations, Sister Ida Norton, her daughter. Belle Tal-ley, her daughter, Eula John, and her daughter, Loretta John. \"All assembled in the chapel where beautiful music was played. When all had arrived they were ushered into the banquet hall. The tables were decorated with beautiful flowers of various colors. At the head table were seated the Relief Society presidency, with their daughters, and one of the stake board members. In the center of the table was a very lovely birthday cake made by one of the members of the Society. \"After being seated, President Trella Ellsworth welcomed all and announced the program.

ANNUAL PICNIC OF THE LINCOLN WARD RELIEF SOCIETY', (TACOMA), SEATTLE STAKE, (WASHINGTON) Photograph submitted by Vilate C. Bottoms, secretary Work Meeting Plan now for Christmas AN APRON DAY FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS CHRISTMAS will be upon us before we know it! Conditions this year present a real opportunity for Relief Society to help its members make lovely gifts for Christmas out of materials they may have on hand. Let us plan the three remaining Relief Society work meetings before Christmas most carefully, so that they will be profitable for all who attend. In addition to necessary work-meeting activities, let us offer special projects designed to interest women who have not hitherto taken an active part in work meetings. There is a way to catch and hold the interest of every woman in the ward if the right way can be found. In order to find it, it is necessary to study carefully the needs of the particular group to which you wish to appeal and try out a number of activities that would seem to meet their special needs. If our program is organized to take care of all members who attend the meeting, we will be able to hold them and help them to solve many of their problems. The women who are interested and busy are not the ones who slip out and go home. Almost every woman makes or buys aprons to be given as Christmas gifts. We all delight to receive one, but how often the delight changes to disappointment when the aprons are tried on and are found to be uncomfortable and poor fitting. This year, when good materials are so difficult to get, it is more important than ever to have those who in the past have given \"just any apron\" consider whether the style and fit they select will be suitable for the one who will wear the apron. One ward with a very enterprising work leader planned a most successful apron day last fall. By looking ahead she was able to purchase enough materials and trimmings for the use of her group. No organdy ruffling was obtainable, but she found an organdy curtain which she had hemstitched in strips. This provided plenty of ruffling. Other trimming was picked up here and there, and soon the class leader had a very interesting assortment of materials and findings for her day. Patterns were selected carefully so that there were some suitable to each material and to every type of figure. Invitations were given to the ward women to come, purchase their materials, cut their aprons, and sew and fit them in the regular work meeting. Making aprons in a group is fun Page  because many ideas may be exchanged. Even though a ward leader may feel that she cannot purchase enough material this year for her entire group, such a day could still be carried out by using all the material available and having every woman who has an apron length of print tucked away in her home bring it for her own use. Odd lengths of bindings, bias tape, rickrack, and bits of lace, too, might be donated. When they are all brought together it will be astonishing to discover what can be done with them. Every tiny scrap can be utilized some way in Relief Society. Save odd pieces of material for toys or gift wrappings which will be discussed in future articles in the Magazine on activities for work-meeting days. This year let us help each other to see the possibilities in the things that are on hand. see: \"Combination Apron and Sewing Bag,\", pages 96-97. \"Utility Aprons,\", page 183. \"Notes From the Field,\" Mount Ogden Stake,, page 457."

Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, December 4, 1945 Objective: To trace the march of the saints westward, and to show that physical hardship can be more easily endured by those who are supported by the spirit of the Lord than by those who are without his spirit. WHEN the Lord set his hand to fulfill his promise and gather Israel, far-reaching were the results. Especially was this true in regard to the journey of the Mormon pioneers. To trace the westward march of the Mormon pioneers under the vigorous hand of President Brigham Young makes real the beginning scenes of God's promise to bring again Israel. A few comparisons of the journey of Israel of old with that of its modern counterpart are interesting. Under Moses were a people of one tongue, having the same customs and racial background that living as a nation brings. Brigham Young led a band of people whose roots were deep within no one nation but many, for the gospel call was to all the world. Ancient Israel was fed manna by the hand of the Lord; the pioneers of our day not only carried their own provisions, but, of necessity, had to plant en route for others to reap. It was to a land of milk and honey, of fertile soil and vineyards, that God sent his people in the days of yore; the modern Israelites for the cause of Zion had left homes of comfort to go into a wilderness, a vast terrain, which early trappers doubted could be made successfully to yield any crop. Had not the Lord planted in the hearts of these pioneers a faith in his word, the marvelous work of the latter days could never have been accomplished. Let it not be felt that suffering and pain were always the lot of the saints, though great indeed at times was their anguish. There was always a joy of spirit which blessed their efforts and made even the physical hardships lighter. To know the true heart of these souls is to know the perfect balance in life between material and spiritual values. With threats, day in and day out, from mobocrats and corrupt government officials, the saints learned to hold their peace and live. Page  For them it was the kingdom of God first, with the assurance that all else would be added. Such a spirit made them build the Nauvoo Temple, knowing their joy within its walls was to be only a matter of months. In fact, this beautiful edifice was not dedicated until after the great majority of the saints was on the march, having left to some three hundred persons the satisfaction of presenting to the Lord, in ceremonial prayer, this most stately of structures then to be found upon the upper windings of the Mississippi River. Nor were these people without their music and dancing. It is recorded within the diaries of many that after the ordinances of the day had been performed in the House of the Lord, there was often a period of recreation. To cover, within the allotted words for this lesson, even a hundredth part of the story of the journey from Nauvoo to the valleys of the mountains would demand the most strict editing of the facts. It is hoped, therefore, that while presenting this interesting part of our history, the teacher will bring to the class, whenever possible, the diaries of pioneers, together with any of their personal effects long preserved and cherished from early days: a fancy pair of gloves, a piece of prized silver, an exquisite shawl, a hand-painted dish or other such loved appointments of the cultured home. These things, somehow, found their way into the barrel bottoms, the odd box corners, and, often, an opportune opening in a wagon-bed. Here was a people sensitive. Too, to the fine arts of living even in the midst of hard requirements which schooled the heart to forego the luxuries. It was the spirit of the Lord, day and night, that made possible the arduous journey across the plains. A firm belief in him and his word put courage in the step and faith in the heart. Ever bear in mind this thought to understand fully the zeal with which the saints traveled on each different day with the hope for better things. What are the significant facts of the pioneers' journey westward? In the dead of winter, the first of the saints crossed the Mississippi from Nauvoo to begin the trek. It was Wednesday, the 4th of February, 1846. Two days later ferrying began in earnest. At the same time as this march by land began, there set sail from the New York harbor the S. S. Brooklyn, to carry by sea around Cape Horn and on to San Francisco two hundred and thirty-five members of the Church. Loaded within this vessel was also a good supply of all kinds of farming implements, tools for the carpenter, the blacksmith, and the wheelwright, together with the machinery for two gristmills and a sawmill. In addition, there were books on various subjects, a press with type and enough paper to start the printed word among the saints when they should arrive in their new-found home. Samuel Brannan was given the directions for this undertaking. It was to become a helping hand, extending material aid to the other companies of foot-weary emigrants whose weighted wagons, of necessity, had to load lightly the iron implements so needed to break the valley sod. LESSON DEPARTMENT 567 To those who were to travel by land or sea came the word from President Young: When the time comes to start westward we will continue to gather until Israel is gathered: let there be no feelings about who shall go first; those who go first will lay the foundations for those who shall come after, and none will be neglected in their time (D. H. C. Vol. VIL, P- 575)- Most of the month of February was spent, by those preparing for the journey by wagons, at a camp on Sugar Creek, Iowa, while, day by day, additional families rolled in to swell the number of exiles. Council meetings were held both at the camp and back in Nauvoo to lay plans for caring for the destitute and needy, many of whom had rushed off without proper supplies for the journey. President Young was prompted to give direct instructions to members of the camp as follows: I wish the brethren to stop running to Nauvoo, hunting, fishing, roasting their shins, idling away their time, and fix nose-baskets for their horses, and save their corn, and fix comfortable places for their wives and children to ride, and never borrow without asking leave, and be sure to return what was borrowed, lest your brother be vexed with you and in his anger curse you and then you would be cursed according to the power of the priesthood that brother possesses and evil will come upon you (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 586). In this winter outpost much suffering from the cold was endured. Nine infants were born at Sugar Creek during those February days. Dr. Richards recorded in his journal for the 19th: The wind blew steadily from the northwest accompanied by snow which fell to a depth of seven or eight inches, but much thawed as it fell, the storm was unceasing, and the evening was very cold (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 593). March of 1846 came in like a lion, and in its extreme cold the camp at Sugar Creek broke up. The journey west began in earnest. All through this month and the month of April which followed, the steady stream of saints pushed over the heavy soil of Iowa with its grassy and rolling lands and deep ravines. By April 24, some one hundred and forty-five miles west of Nauvoo, a camp site was selected and named Garden Grove. Here, within a short period, a thriving village was set upon a clearing. Samuel Bent was named president with Aaron Johnson and David Fullmer as counselors to direct this camp of Israel. Here, many of the saints were to remain, build, and plant for those who were to come after. President Brigham Young saw the need of holding ground while extending ever westward the march to the mountains. By now the great body of the saints had left Nauvoo. May brought the return of spring to the prairies. By the 18th, President Young, in company with Parley P. Pratt and others, found joy in the sights there were on every hand. Elder Pratt writes: One day riding about three or four miles through beautiful prairies, I came suddenly to some round and sloping hills, grassy, and crowned with beautiful groves of timber; while alternate open groves and forests seemed blended in all the beauty and harmony of an English park. While beneath and beyond, on the west, rolled a main branch of the Grand River, with its rich bottoms of alternate forest and prairie. As I approached this lovely scenery, several deer and wolves, being startled at the sight of me, abandoned the place and bounded away till lost from my sight and the groves. Being pleased and excited at the varied beauty before me, I cried out \"this is Mount Pisgah\" (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 607). With joy and the returning hope of the new season of the year, the saints set about building their second camp of major importance in Iowa. Land was fenced and preparations begun for planting and home building. William Huntington, Ezra T. Benson, and Charles C. Rich were chosen to take charge. But for President Young and his party the call was to press on. Over Indian trails and rude bridges they traveled until, on June 14, they arrived at the banks of the muddy Missouri not far from Council Bluffs. They were then in the land of the Potawatomis, a friendly tribe whose chiefs were kind. By the 29th, companies were ferrying across the river. At Council Bluffs, President Young waited to gather in the long train of companies, for he was desirous of giving his people instructions. When some five hundred wagons had wheeled in, their leader addressed the saints assembled. He warned them to be faithful to the Lord and press on. Wicked men would seek to prevent them from doing so, he said, but the saints would find the place to which the Lord would have them go if they would heed his words. Things now seemed right for the journey to continue, the summer months lay ahead and the Platte River with its green banks and shallow eddies lay flattened out some five hundred miles across the level plains of Nebraska. Here was the life-line of shade and drink for the travelers. Then came Wyoming and its Sweetwater leading high into the bracing air of the Rockies. Yes, the journey from here on gave a feeling of uplift and freedom in the heart. Then, too, it was June time of the year. On the closing day of this month came word from Washington. Captain James Allen of the United States Army arrived on the 30th to put an end to dreams. His credentials were for the raising of five hundred men to serve as volunteers in the war with Mexico, recently declared. Strange that a government which would permit thousands of its citizens to be mobbed, now should turn and ask such a people for the flower of their manhood to fight a war. Here was a chance for the saints to turn the other cheek, and this they did courageously. Five hundred men stepped forth within a period of weeks to complete the longest march in the history of the United States infantry. They not only wrote a chapter in the story of Mormon allegiance to the flag, but they were blessed to come through the war unharmed. \"Detachments of the battalion who wintered at Pueblo... Together with the main body of the Mississippi Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley, under direction of Captain James Brown,\" only five days after the arrival of the original company, bringing with them sixty wagons, one hundred head of fine horses and mules, and three hundred head of cattle. LESSON DEPARTMENT 569 How strange the ways of the Lord! Had it been written that upon the arrival of most of the saints in the promised land, domestic animals and modern wains would be there to greet them, would not this have taken a test of faith to believe! But this did not come to pass, however, without sacrifices, for because of the weakened condition of the main body of the saints, with the able-bodied men gone, it became necessary to make preparations for the coming winter. It was a bitter season of snow these exiles spent at Winter Quarters. Many lived in dugouts along the muddy bluffs not far from the Missouri River. At least the saints were consoled in the thought that they had been given permission to remain in that country, and had there found a true friend in Colonel Thomas L. Kane, who importuned the President of the United States in their behalf. Today, as solemn testimony of the bleak winter spent in Nebraska, there stands upon a hill in Florence a Mormon cemetery, within whose graves lie the bodies of many saints and those of infants born but to die of exposure in the cold. With their faces toward the east they await the call of a brighter morn. With the davming of the year 1847 came the voice of the Lord to:... President Brigham Young, at Winter Quarters, giving instructions for the guidance of the camps of Israel on their journeyings to the west. The Saints were to be organized into companies, with captains over hundreds, fifties and tens, as the case had been while journeying across Iowa. These companies were to be presided over by a president and two counselors, under the direction of the Twelve Apostles, who were at the head of all the camps of Israel. The Saints were to enter into a covenant \"to keep all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. (Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, p. 433). It was further the command of the Lord that departure for the West should be early in the spring in order to provide for the planting of crops. April 5, 1847, was the day when the march began. On up the north side of the Platte River it went, over the south pass of the Rocky Mountains, past Fort Bridger, west through Echo and East Canyons, then on to Big and Little Mountains which pointed to Emigration Canyon and the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. Stories of the landmarks of the plains, the forts, the Indians, the wild beasts and the travelers met en route, go to make up this eventful trek, until, from a bed in a carriage. President Young raised himself to look over the valley in the heart of the mountains and say, \"This is the place, drive on.\" It was in July, the month commemorating independence, that the saints arrived. Grateful and happy they were to mark their day of freedom in a new land as the 24th, which, singularly enough, counted the exact number of years since the Angel Moroni first brought the restored gospel to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the text to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word.\" 1. As early as six months after the organization of the Church the Lord, speaking through his prophet Joseph Smith, said the gathering of his elect \"into one place upon the face of this land\" must take place (Doc. And Gov. 29:8). Why are we as a people in a better position today to under stand the wisdom of the Lord in sounding such a call than were the few saints who were present when the revelation was given in September of 1830? In drawing out the answer to this question have the class reflect upon the world conditions today. These may be listed. Read Doc. and Cov. sections 1, 38, 88, 93 in the Doc. and Cov. Commentary. Found in these verses. Read any section in Doc. and Cov. 33.\nHave section 136 of the Doctrine and Covenants read with its introductory paragraph. Pay particular attention to the following parts of the revelation: verses 3, 6, 8, 10, 16, 20, 28, 31, 35, 36, 39. In the light of the lesson have these discussed.\n3. What are some of the interesting facts you know of the journey to the Rocky Mountains? Read chapters 37, 38, 39 in Essentials in Church History.\nThe following questions may be used if needed for further class activity or they may be assigned for home study. What facts of human interest may be gained from the diaries of the pioneers? Read \"Through Diaries of Long Ago,\" Children's Friend, July 1942.\nSpecial Note: Be sure to make full use of other material in the July 1944 issue of Thefor study in connection with the course in Church History.\n(Note: On this map an error was made in locating Harmony. The town of Harmony, now known as Oakland, should be located on the Susquehanna River, just south of the state line of New York and Pennsylvania. See Essentials in Church History, map page 47.) Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 3?Charity Envieth Not Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, December 4, 1945\nObjective: To show that the cultivation of the spirit of charity will rid our lives of envy.\nENVY works on the mind much as cancer does on the body. Instead of enriching the mind from without, it destroys it from within. Envy is a product of covetousness; it looks upon and desires that which is not its own, but upon that which belongs to another. Its ways are unholy evil: envy keeps one in misery by focusing his attention on that which he lacks; at the same time, it diverts one's energy from acquiring objects of one's desire in a profitable and legitimate way; and envy\ncauses one to dislike, and even to hate, the person who possesses that which he desires for himself.\nEnvy cannot be conquered by a frontal attack, by concentrating on the evil itself. To rid our lives of envy, we must look first for its cause, and second, to some power even greater than envy itself with which to erase it.\nEnvy has its roots in our own lack. It is an admission that we are not prepared to live a rich, soul-satisfying life. LESSON DEPARTMENT 571 Living the gospel win enable us to overcome the feeling of lack in our lives and rob envy of its nourishment. Alma tells us that, if we will plant the seed of faith (in the word of God) in our hearts, and nourish it with patience until it takes root in us, that by and by we?... Shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst (Alma 32:42 also note verses 27-43). \"Charity seeketh not her own.\" She rejoices in the success of others. She is aware, not of her own needs, but of the needs of others. Hers is the spirit of giving, of helping, of loving. A heart full of charity has no place in it for envy. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 3?Bible Influences As Revealed in Our Lyric Literature Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, December 18, 1945 Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace. Good will toward men. THIS heavenly lyric, voiced by angels over gentle Bethlehem in the long, long ago, touches the heart of our study. Its soulful lines carry a message of divine meaning for wayward humanity. They point the way toward heaven. This inspiring song is sometimes called the first of Christmas carols. Carol singing among human folk, however, did not come until more than a thousand years following that holy night. And yet, it was the inspiration of that beautiful song and the coming of the Christ child it heralded which gave to us the car- (Luke 2:14) ols we love to sing to help keep Christmas a holy day. In a true sense, a carol is a song of praise for a festal occasion. As Christianity was spread among the common folk, their joyousness began to find expression, particularly at Christmas time, in singing praise to the Savior. Lyric lines springing out of their hearts became, with time, charming folk songs; and the best loved of these were passed on through the years. From this rich heritage we get such soul-lifting expressions as the following; It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, From angels bending near the earth, to touch their harps of gold; Peace on earth, good will to men; from heav'n's gracious king. The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing. O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant; O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; Come and behold him, born the king of angels; O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord! Some of our gifted writers, catching the spirit of the folk carols, have created lyrics which take place with those time-honored songs. Among these are Luther's \"Cradle Hymn\" and \"Silent Night, Holy Night\" by Franz Gruber, known by heart and sung in many tongues. Another that holds our affection for its sweetness and light is \"O Little Town of Bethlehem\" by Phillips Brooks, inspired on a Christmas Eve spent by him in this town where the Savior was born. Following is the first stanza of that beautiful song: O little town of Bethlehem! How still we see thee lie; Above thy deep and dreamless sleep, The silent stars go by; Yet in thy dark streets shineth The everlasting light; The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee tonight. All down the years the story of the Christ child, with the angels and the shepherds, the star and the wise men, has been the inspiration of lyric expression. Countless songs have been and are still being created around this theme. Another sacred theme that has profoundly influenced our lyric literature is the resurrection of the Savior. To a world groping in spiritual darkness, this divine event brought radiant light. With the sublime revelation that man can rise from the tomb into immortal existence, life took on new meaning, more heavenly purpose. For art expression, it was the opening of a new vista, arched by a rainbow of hope for a more glorious future. Lyric lines, expressive of faith in immortality, accepting death as a part of the eternal life plan, as but a portal opening into a larger life, are to be found in many outstanding poems. Following are a few such sincere and helpful expressions: Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returneth. Was not spoken of the soul. ?\"Psalm of Life,\" Longfellow Ah, well for us all some sweet hope lies Deeply buried from human eyes. And in the hereafter angels may Roll the stone from its grave away. ?\"Maud Muller,\" Whittier #? * I stay my haste, I make delays? For what avails this eager pace? I stand amid the eternal ways And what is mine shall know my face. ?\"Waiting,\" John Burroughs * ?# Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea. But such a tide as moving seems asleep. Too full for sound and foam. When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. Twilight and evening bell. And after that the dark And may there be no sadness of farewell. When I embark; LESSON DEPARTMENT 573 For though from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to meet my Pilot face to face When I have crossed the bar. ?\"Crossing the Bar,\" Tennyson Another appealing theme was found in the loving service of the Savior. His living lessons in true charity, tolerance, brotherhood, neighborliness, and other Christian virtues have been a constant inspiration to authors. Illustrations that follow are typical of thousands of lines that echo the divine precepts and example of the Master in making the gospel live among men: She never found fault with you, never implied Your wrong by her right; and yet men at her side Grew nobler, girls purer, as through the whole town The children were gladder that pulled at her gown? ?\"My Kate,\" Elizabeth Barrett Browning *?? It is not just as we take it. This mystical world of ours. Life's field will yield as we make it A harvest of thorns or of flowers. ?\"Perseverance,\" Goethe KY God send us a little home To come back to when we roam. Red firelight and deep chairs. Small white beds upstairs. Homely flowers in brown sod. Overhead thy stars, O God! ?\"Prayer for Home,\" Anonymous If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain; If I can ease one life the aching.... I shall not live in vain. ?\"Success,\" Emily Dickinson I see from my house by the side of the road, By the side of the highway of life. The men who press on with the ardor of hope. The men who are faint with the strife. But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears? Both parts of an infinite plan; Let me live in a house by the side of the road And be a friend of man. ?\"The House by the Side of the Road,\" Sam Walter Foss All such poetical expressions serve to further the great purpose of the Savior in bringing the gospel to earth. He spent his life doing good among men. Lyrical lines such as these help us to see more clearly the inner meaning of his divine work, and to feel something of the joy of our Father in heaven when we follow in the footsteps of his Only Begotten Son. It was something of this thought that inspired James Whitcomb Riley when he penned in homely dialect the little poem called ?Jim?? a tribute to a self-sacrificing shoemaker. Jim was always giving, always helping and cheering those who came to his shop. Even in his closing days, when an incurable illness was taking his strength, the kindly cobbler had ever a pleasant word to give to others. And after he had passed to his reward, the poet has one of Jim's fellow workers say tenderly: When God made Jim, I bet he didn't do anything else that day But jest set around and feel good. No small contribution to the bringing of the Savior into our daily lives has been made by gifted poets of our own faith. Songs of their creation that we love to sing not only keep us actively helpful, but also lift us closer to a heaven of reality, where the warmth of both father and mother love awaits those who win salvation through a life of righteousness. This appealing truth finds most artistic expression in \"O My Father,\" a lyric prayer by Eliza R. Snow, which ranks among the finest of religious poems. Besides the wealth of carols and hymns, anthems and oratorios linking directly with the Bible, there is a wealth of other lyrics that are in tune with its spirit. Songs of innocent childhood, of nature in all her moods, of home and friends, of pure love, of loyalty and patriotism?all are in consonance with true religion. Lines like these that follow surely lift us a little nearer heaven: My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky. ?Wordsworth The little bird sits at his door in the sun A-tilt like a blossom among the leaves. ?Lowell I can hear the robin's warble and the meadowlark's sweet trills All around the dear old homestead lyin' there among the hills. ?Harrison R. Merrill But the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze Of a crisp and sunny morning of the early autumn days Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mock? When the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder's in the shock. ?\"When the Frost Is On the Punkin,\" James Whitcomb Riley It has been a long evening. I have watched A sky of clouds go by. God lent A crown of sunshafts To flash and fall away. I am content. ?Leon Loofbourow Think every morning when the birds peep through The dim, leaf-latticed windows of the grove. How jubilant the happy birds renew Their old melodious madrigals of love! And when you think of this, remember, too, 'Tis always morning somewhere, and above The awakening continents from shore to shore Somewhere the birds arc singing evermore. ?Longfellow I'm hungering in the city for the smell of fragrant timber. For the valleys where the birchbark smoke goes curling through the trees. For the lazy miles of lakeshore, where the blue waves kiss the pebbles, In the land of skyblue water, up beyond the inland seas. ?May Stanley And last, this soul-stirring stanza from a nineteen-year-old American air pilot who gave his life to help preserve our freedom: Up, up the long delirious blue I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace Where never lark, or even eagle flew? And while with silent lifting mind I've trod The high untrespassed sanctity of grace, Put out my hand and touched the face of God. ?John G. Magee, Jr. Discussion and Activities 1.

            "content": "FAMILY prayers help to keep the family in remembrance of its obligations to and covenants with the Lord. We, as Latter-day Saints, are pledged to \"always remember him\" that we may always have his spirit to be with us. Families who remember these obligations will not be disobedient to the commandments. They will not be found among the numerous waves of the world; they will not be listed among the Sabbath-breakers, nor among those who violate the Word of Wisdom or the law of chastity. They will not be teaching their children disobedience by holding before them an example of disobedience. Rather, they will be among the stalwarts of the Church, upholding the program of the Church, keeping the commandments and working constantly in the work or stakes.\nFamily prayer brings into the home the spirit of prayer, and any family which is actuated by the spirit of prayer is actuated by the spirit of God. Persons who leave a house of prayer each morning should carry with them an attitude of good will and fair play, of doing unto others as they would be done by; of righteousness, having a distaste for evil. In that way they may come to understand the meaning in the Savior's words: \"Pray always lest ye enter into temptation.\"\nWhere family prayers are held in sincerity and humility, the hearts of the members of those families are moved by a desire to be in harmony with the Lord and his servants. Where such a spirit prevails, there is no criticism of the bishop or the stake president, and there is no denunciation of the general authorities, for such criticism is out of harmony with the spirit of prayer. When persons refrain from criticism of the brethren, they resist one of the\napostate tendencies against which the Prophet Joseph has warned us.\nWhere family prayers are held with devotion, the home is not given over to activities which are opposed to the spirit of prayer. There is no drinking or smoking there, no vile stories, no unchanneled dealings, no lying nor backbiting, nothing unseemly. On the contrary, the home functions are conducted on a high plane where the habits of life are clean. Have you considered what this is worth in the rearing of a family?\nIt is the desire of the Church to see character built into the souls of\nfull of faith, devotion, and integrity. Sincere family prayer will help tremendously to bring this about. Can we neglect so great an opportunity?\nIf we as a people will hold family prayer in our homes with regularity, with faith and humility, and then establish habits of life in keeping with our prayers, the windows of heaven will be opened and such blessings will be poured out upon us that we can hardly contain them. Many of the problems which now vex us will fade away, life will be sweet indeed, and not only will we ourselves be benefited, but we will be as a light upon a hill, a beacon to all mankind. PRAYER Edwin C. Bliss To some, a prayer is mere routine, A boresome obligation. Prosaic offering of thanks. And unfelt adoration. Such praises, sung by grudging lips. Can never reach the throne; For God cares not for prayers made up Of words and words alone. A prayer must be a consecration, Heartfelt and sincere; A faith that, though the load be heavy, God is ever near; A willingness to work and wait As through the years we plod. And place our life entirely Within the hands of God. Shall I Be an Active Member of Relief Society? A Question Which is Vital to Every Woman in the Church Kate M. Barker Former Member Relief Society General Board \nAT the dedication of the science hall on the campus of one of our large universities, a student guide explained to the group he was conducting, \"In this room the tables for these sensitive instruments are stone pillars built on solid rock. If we are to get accurate readings it is necessary to have a foundation that goes down below the vibrations, shocks, and jars of the earth's surface.\"\nWhen the news came of the restoration of peace to the world, we received it with humble, prayerful thanksgiving. For five long years we had prayed for this moment, hoping that if the opportunity were given us again we would build a better world. The war has been a major spiritual shock. For five years we have seen the result of the greed, false pride, and selfishness that was the war's antecedents. Every day the press and the radio have brought us graphic accounts of man's \"inhumanity to man.\" So shocking have been the devastating events of the past years, that evil has seemed to far overshow good and we have become almost fearful of life.\nAt the same time that peace came we realized we were facing a new age a stupendous new age, the fruits of which, when the reactionary forces will be harnessed for man's\ndestruction or blessing. When the voice of the President of the United States came over the radio announcing the dropping of the atomic bomb with its resulting terrible devastation and loss of life, the first universal reaction was one of fear. \"It is a harnessing of the basic powers of the universe,\" came the voice of the President, and we stood awestruck, fearful. Verily \"men's hearts failed them.\"\n\"Can truth and goodness triumph?\" we ask. \"What does the future hold for our children?\"\nAs in the case of the delicate scientific instruments, in times like these man's spiritual nature must be anchored on solid rock. Unless the foundations of our faith are so anchored, the contemporary shocks of world affairs will find us confused and fearful; and our reading of life's scales will be only surface readings and not accurate readings.\nThe challenging words of our Savior to his disciples can be applied to us. \"Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?\" And the comforting words, \"And this word, Yet once more ... signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken ... that those things which cannot be shaken may remain\" (Heb. 12:27).\nOur faith, then, assures us that now after the world hurricane has\npassed, we shall find that the things of real value have survived. Beauty will remain beauty in earth and sea and sky; beauty in art, music, literature; beauty in character, in life. Truth also will remain. Goodness will survive. God still lives and will guide our destinies if we but let him and are willing to cooperate. We have lost some of our worldly assets, but the real values will carry through. They will survive for all to choose who will.\nSo the present, instead of making us despondent, should be a challenge. Surely we are thanking our Heavenly Father today more gratefully than ever for the gospel and for his Church. Surely now more than ever our testimonies seem priceless, and we are resolved that their foundations must go deeper and deeper until \"surface shocks\" of life cannot weaken them. Now we know that the thing we desire above all else for our children is a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, a testimony so strong that it will be the motivating force always in their lives, a testimony and faith anchored so deeply and solidly that it will stand against all life's storms.\nThe use to which these tremendous forces which have been harnessed will be put, will depend on us. It will take intelligence. Such an age as we are facing demands strong people, a people who have faith in God, in mankind, and in man's destiny. We realize that the world is going to be filled with confusion, problems, and great demands.\nNo generation of women has ever faced greater responsibility. The home must be the nucleus for the better world; and the home cannot\nbe protected by merely negative ethics you must not do this, you must not do that. We must build a more definite, constructive faith in the basic, eternal, guiding principles of life. We must know as never before the divine plans for our happiness and welfare. Surely, the women of the Church, having faced the horrors of the war years, are resolved that henceforth their homes shall be built on the solid foundation of faith and, having seen the world suffering from so much that is false and ugly, are resolved that, insofar as they are able to control, only truth shall enter the home such truth as gives beauty to life and dignity to mankind and to human relationships.\nWOMAN has a great responsibility in setting standards and maintaining the spiritual and cultural level of the home and community. Our Father in heaven, knowing our needs to meet this responsibility, has been kind to the women of the Church. He has given them an organization of their own in which they can seek all those things that are \"virtuous, lovely, and of good report\" as the Prophet said, \"according to their natures.\" We do not learn best by ourselves added understanding, added appreciation comes with contact with the ideas and experiences of others.\nThe knowledge most worthwhile is certainly an understanding of the greatest needs of the beauty in the gospel, which is God's plan for our happiness. We could study all the greatest literature and no doubt never new beauty would unfold. As our knowledge and testimony increase, life takes on new meaning and beauty.\nOur Relief Society gives us the opportunity of a course of study that has been prayerfully planned and as broad as life itself spiritual, cultural, practical. We can be sure that only truth is contained therein, that everything given is worthwhile. Facts alone may be cold, but when interpreted in the light of the gospel, they take on glorious meanings. Our Relief Society teaching is done in \"the light of the gospel.\"\nToday, we must seek our happiness in a world where experiences, in a variety of ways, are continually attacking our faith and menacing our homes and our chances for a satisfying life. The modern tempo is characterized by an acid type of cynicism which does not believe that anything in the world is worthy of our serious allegiance. When people feel this way, not only marriage ties but all human relationships lose value, and life loses its sense of direction. And yet in every human soul is a longing for loyalty to something outside ourselves. The dictators have capitalized on this innate longing in their appeal to the young. \"Cynicism is defeatism applied to ideals.\" We can best be protected from it by the atmosphere of a loyal group working together for worthy ends.\nSo, active membership, loyalty to the Church is the finest safeguard against this defeatism, and all the resultant things that are cheap and shallow. The lack of intense loyalties to worthy causes is one of the great spiritual losses of modern times. Most parents desire greatly that their children belong to and feel a loyalty to their Church organization; yet, sometimes to us, we that the things they say and do, the\nloyalties they show, forge themselves into a pattern for their children, and children are influenced most by those whom they love most.\nMoreover, seeing is believing. We of the older generation whose parents or grandparents sacrificed so much to be true to the Church, have a background whose influence can seldom be entirely lost. We may become inactive and apparently indifferent for awhile, and then in later life repent. But what about our children who have seen only our disloyalties? President George Albert Smith, in a recent talk in Bonneville Stake, told the story of the son of one of our brethren who drifted away from all Church activity. In later life he realized what he was missing and returned to the Church, but found that his interest in the Church or its ideals could be aroused in his children. As President Smith said, \"He could repent but he could not repent for his children.\" In the fine lives of our children is our greatest joy, and in their failure is our greatest sorrow, especially when we realize that some fault of our own has contributed to that failure.\nWe can be no greater than our loyalties. The women of the Church have a divinely organized, divinely guided organization which is deserving of their greatest loyalty.\nFRIENDSHIP is one of the finest spiritual experiences and one of the greatest needs of the human soul. We find strength in companionship. Loss of sincere, loyal friendships has been another of the spiritual losses in our superficial, material-minded, modern age. Relief Society offers the opportunity for building close, warm, sincere friendships with women who will share their courage, vision and faith with us. The world is crying for greater understanding sincere friendships. We of the Church must demonstrate that true friendship can be had that groups of women can organize work together, study together, in understanding and sympathy the joy of one bringing joy to all, the sorrow of one bringing sorrow to all, the reputation of each being the concern of all. Spiritual life flourishes in such deeply knit groups. The Prophet Joseph Smith, when organizing Relief Society, promised, \"If you live up to your privileges, the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates.\" Are we missing this great blessing because of lack of unity and because of the apathy of some to sense their responsibilities? What great spiritual benefit, what great strength to the Church would surely come if, in every ward, all the women were united in such groups!\nAdults do not grow unless they serve. The opportunities for service in Relief Society are many. Someone has said that in service one and one are more than two but two together can accomplish more than two working alone. There is power in united effort, though the individual contribution may be small, yet if each does his share a few hours, what a wonderful contribution their united efforts make to the great Church Welfare Plan. Our little becomes part of a great whole.\nThe average attendance at Relief Society meetings is low. There is too often the feeling that absence from meetings affects only the members who absent themselves, that\nization can never realize its highest potentialities until every woman senses her responsibility, that there is an influence, a spirit, an interest and enthusiasm which the alone can give, that there is a definite plan and need for her at each meeting.\nAn unusual custom is observed in a small English country chapel at evening services. At the end of each pew is a candlestick. When the family is not constantly uses that pew is ushered in, the candle is lighted. When the family is not present the pew remains dark. When we are absent from meeting our place remains dark.\nTo every woman of the Church our Father in heaven has given the opportunities that come in Relief Society, and every woman has the responsibility for the success of the organization. As members of the Church we must choose opportunities and responsibilities are ours. There can be no question as to that. The only question is, will each one of us gratefully seize these opportunities, and will each one of us gladly accept our responsibilities?\nToday, there are many avenues of activity for women outside the home. But we have limited time and energy we must choose wisely and spend it well. It seems especially true of mothers that there is often confusion when they leave home, unless some responsible person can make for the children the little while she is away. Every woman needs mental stimulus, spiritual enrichment, friendly associates. How necessary it is that we get our values straight that our life's perspective be right and that we attend our activities accordingly. The hours spent in Relief Society are not hours selfishly spent. We put our market basket on our arm, as it were, and go forth to obtain food, spiritual food, to share with the family.\nIT is therefore vital that every woman in the Church should ask herself the question, \"Shall I be active in Relief Society?\" Each one should get her values straight and answer fairly.\nWhy Should I?\nBecause I want a living, growing testimony of the gospel and an understanding of woman's nature. The Relief Society lessons and discussions help me in this understanding.\nBecause I want to continue my education along the lines I most need. Relief Society offers an educational course which as the Prophet said is \"according to woman's nature.\"\nBecause I want intellectual and spiritual contacts with women of like ideals. Relief Society offers me these contacts.\nBecause I need sincere friendships. Relief Society offers me the opportunity for forming such friendships.\nBecause I want to get all the truth and beauty I can. I want life to be meaningful. Everything offered in Relief Society is worthwhile.\nBecause I need help in being a homemaker. Relief Society gives this help.\nBecause I want to be associated with an organization deserving my greatest loyalty. Relief Society, divinely organized and divinely directed, is worthy of my greatest loyalty.\nBecause I am thankful for the blessings the Church has brought me, I will show my appreciation by my activity. I want happiness and satisfaction in life. Our Father in heaven has told us to meet together often as sisters. I will follow his advice.\nBecause I wish to serve. In Relief Society my little becomes a part of a great service.\nBecause I have the opportunity of joining an organization which, in origin and nature, is different from all other women's organizations.\nBecause I want to face life eagerly and courageously, my faith, my loyalties must be so firmly anchored that I can read life's values accurately.\nThese are but a few of the answers that come so probably our question should not be, \"Shall I be an active member in Relief Society?\" but, \"Can I afford not to be an active member?\" CHALLENGE Mabel Jones Gabhott These words He gave to man, His challenge, rich and true; \"Love one another. Even as I love you.\" The Bottom Drawer Ruby Scranton Jones MAJEL hurried home as soon as school was out. It was Wednesday, the day Bart's letter came, and the thought of it had made her day bright. Yes, there it was on the hall table where Grandma always put it. She carried it to her room and began to read. She smiled at the salutation, \"My darling little Sweetheart,\" but soon frowned as she read, \"There'll be three weddings right after graduation. Why not make it four? Please, don't say 'no.' It's what I want most in the world. I'll have two weeks' leave and then I report at a field on Long Island for three months' bomber training. We could be sure of that much time together, at least.\" Majel sat in her little rocker, the letter in her lap. What was Bart thinking of? He must know a teacher couldn't run off that way without giving notice. Then there was Grandma. What would she do? Just then Grandma stopped in the doorway. \"What's the matter, Honey,\" she asked. Majel looked up into the wise old blue eyes so like her own young ones. \"Bart wants me to come to Texas and marry him next Wednesday. He should know I can't do that.\" \"Of course not,\" Grandma said indignantly. \"Such haste wouldn't be decent.\" \"But how to tell him, that's what bothers me.\" Majel took up the letter and started to read again. \"Scold him good for suggesting Page 588 such a thing.\" The little old lady dismissed the problem with a shrug. But it wasn't so simple as that. Majel and Bart had gone together since high school days. She had worn his fraternity pin since they had been juniors in the university. They had planned their life together in long, earnest talks. They knew just what kind of house they would build to accommodate the hoped for children. Always there had been a place for Grandma in their plans. When war came Bart became a pilot, not a lawyer, and they decided they would not marry until the war was over. All evening Majel worked on her answer. She explained what the principal had said about the disloyalty of teachers who left to make more money or to get married, and how she had promised to finish out the year. She told how Grandma had had several heart attacks and could not be left alone. She wrote the letter over and over but the last version sounded no more convincing than the first. Wednesday, Majel sent a telegram of congratulation to Bart. She had no letter that day but, of course, she thought, Bart would have been too busy to write. And then on Saturday she heard that Bart was home home without letting her know so she could meet him. Why would he do that, she wondered, when we haven't seen each other for nine months? He must know this is as hard for me as it is for him. SUNDAY, Majel did not go to church. She wanted to be home when Bart called. She spent an hour arranging her soft black curls in the even rows he liked. She put on a new blue suit and then changed to a rose wool dress that he had said he hoped would never wear out. And still there was no call. At last she went to her room and sat staring out the window.\nAfter dark, when she had almost given up hope, the bell rang and Bart was there. He said, \"Hello,\" as though nothing had happened and kissed her on the cheek.\n\"Lieutenant Winters,\" she said, stepping back to look at him. \"How you do set off that uniform.\" She touched the gold bar on his shoulder. \"And how tanned you are. Or is it that your hair has bleached in the Texas sun?\"\n\"A little of both,\" he said, following her into the living room.\nShe wanted desperately to throw her arms around him and tell him how proud she was, but the unusual coolness of his manner restrained her.\nJust then Grandma hurried in. She pulled down his head and kissed him. \"Bad boy,\" she said. \"Surely you wouldn't want Majel to be one of those war brides.\"\n\"Well,\" he said flushing, \"we've been engaged long enough, haven't we?\"\n\"What kind of marriage would that be?\" She shook her finger at him. \"You've plenty of time. Why, Majel's not twenty and you're only twenty-one. You're just children.\" She went out, leaving them laughing but annoyed.\n\"Oh, Bart,\" Majel said as he sat down beside her. \"You must see\nthat I couldn't break a contact. Teachers are impossible to replace and I promised to stay.\" She turned to look at him but he wouldn't meet her eyes. \"And I just couldn't leave Grandma when she's not well.\" Still he didn't speak. \"Don't you see, Bart, I just couldn't do it?\" Her tone was pleading now.\n\"No, I don't. You've always said marriage meant more to you than anything else.\" His voice rose in anger. \"Now you say a job is more important or your Grandmother.\" When Majel tried to speak, he hurried on, \"I want you to be my wife before I have to go. Is it too much to expect?\" He got up to pace back and forth, his gray eyes stormy.\nMAJEL reached out to stop him, but he stepped aside. \"Bart, dear,\" she said, \"you know how I love you and how much I want to be your wife. But what kind of marriage would that be for either of us? I wouldn't be happy because I would feel guilty, and you wouldn't be happy feeling you had persuaded me to do something wrong. We've got to plan for all the years ahead, not just for three months.\"\n\"Yes, and while you're planning, I'll be out there fighting and probably getting killed.\"\n\"Don't, Bart, don't.\" She covered her face with her hands.\nBart stopped in front of her. \"Well, marry me then if you care so much.\"\n\"There are so m many reasons why I can't,\" she sobbed.\nBart snatched up his cap and started for the door. Then he turned. \"I might have known it was that bottom drawer you cared for,\" he accused, \"and not me.\" He went out and slammed the door. Majel sat a long time thinking. How could this have happened to her and Bart who loved each other so much. And what was it he had said about her \"bottom drawer?\" Majel had been left' an orphan when she was six and had come to live with her father's mother. The old lady had kept the little gid from being too lonely by telling her stories of Ireland. The one most sure to interest her was about the Irish girls who set aside the bottom drawers of their dressers for their hope chests. So Grandma had taught her all kinds of needlework and together they had crocheted doilies, embroidered towels, hemmed napkins, and wrapped them in blue tissue and put them away in the bottom drawer of the old dresser. As the years passed, under this influence, she had come to look upon marriage as the sole interest of her life. When Barton Winters moved to their town and began to show his preference for her, Majel accepted him as the fulfilment of all her dreams. And then her bottom drawer held an added interest. She worked vacations to buy the finest sheets and pillow cases to monogram. She pieced quilts of intricate pattern, crocheted a bedspread, and lastly learned how to weave a tablecloth as dainty as a spider web. The bottom drawer had long ago become an overflowing cedar chest. She had told Bart about it as he watched her sew in the evenings they spent at home. He had shown pride in her work. \"My little housewife,\" he had said, \"my little old-fashioned girl.\" But tonight, Majel thought, he had not been proud of her. He had been disappointed and angry like one of the little boys she taught. \"DART came back the next evening and apologized. He laughed it off and took her to a movie. Tuesday evening she wanted to stay at home but Bart said they should go calling. Wednesday, they decided to have a real party with dinner and dancing at the hotel. For the first time since his return, Bart seemed natural and happy. They had given their order and Bart had just said, \"Let's try this dance,\" when Milly Andrews, a girl they had known in school, came in with another officer. When she saw Bart she hurried over. \"Hello, handsome,\" she said. \"Why didn't you let your friends know?\" She nodded to Majel and introduced her escort. \"Why can't we sit here, too?\" she asked, so Bart drew out a chair for her and they all sat down. All through the university, Milly had made no secret of her liking for Bart. When the orchestra started a particularly snappy tune she said, \"Oh, Bart, that's ours,\" and jumped up. Bart looked at Majel with raised eyebrows, so she nodded. There seemed nothing else to do. Lieutenant Jackson turned to Majel. \"Do you mind not dancing?\" he asked. \"I'm hardly up to it. I'm just out of the hospital.\" For the first time Majel looked closely. At him and noticed how pale he was. \"Of course not,\" she answered. \"It's too fast for me anyway.\" With her usual kindliness she set about to entertain him, but with half her mind she kept thinking, why, Milly would marry him tomorrow if he asked her. THE BOTTOM DRAWER 591 When the dance was over, more friends came in, so they pushed two tables together and the evening became a reception for Bart. Majel enjoyed the repartee, the dancing, two things she had missed while Bart was away. He was very attentive and she soon forgot the unhappy incident which had threatened to spoil the evening. At midnight Majel stood up. \"Fm sorry,\" she said, \"but I have to work tomorrow.\" \"Oh, yes,\" Milly laughed, \"the little school-teacher.\" Her voice showed plainly the scorn in which she held the whole profession. \"Why don't you take her home, Bart, and then come back?\" \"I guess not,\" he said as he held Majel s coat. \"I d just be extra.\" \"An extra man's not to be sneezed at these days.\" Milly shook her blond bob becomingly. All the way home Majel kept thinking, why couldn't we have had the evening to ourselves. I might have been able to explain things. I might have been able to convince him. She lay awake a long time wondering if Bart had gone back to the hotel. Should she be more demonstrative? Should she try to make Bart jealous? It would have been so easy with Lieutenant Jackson. No, no matter what happened to her she would never be like Milly. But should she forget her scruples and offer to marry him? What could a nice girl do to hold the man she loved? On Bart's last evening he was having dinner with Majel and her Grandmother, when Mary Stuart, an old friend, came in. She was incoherent with excitement but they finally gathered that she was leaving the next day to marry a man she had met the summer before and seen but twice since. \"But, Mary, you hardly know him,\" Majel said in shocked surprise. \"And how could you live on a private's pay?\" \"Why, I know him better than Fve ever known anyone,\" Mary answered indignantly. \"And as for living, Fll get a job. A stenographer can get work anywhere.\" OART got up from the table and patted her shoulder. \"Good girl,\" he said. \"You're doing exactly right. If you want him, better grab him before some other girl does.\" Mary smiled and said \"Thanks. That's the first good word I've heard.\" Majel thought, that's what he really believes. That's how he wants me to be. He can't see the difference between Mary's problem and mine. Bart left early because he was taking a midnight plane and he didn't suggest that Majel see him off. He kissed her and told her that he would write soon. She might have been just any girl he had taken out a few times. She cried when he was gone because the ten days had been such a failure. He knew, of course, that school would be out in three months, and the chief obstacle to their marriage removed, but he hadn't mentioned it. And he hadn't given her a ring. Of course, she still had his fraternity pin but a ring seemed so much more definite. She couldn't sleep, so she got up (Continued on page 613) The Fight Against Infantile Paralysis Must Continue Frank S. Emery Utah State Representative, National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis  POLIOMYELITIS, commonly known as infantile paralysis, is caused by a virus, infinitesimally small, which lives on the nerve cells of the living body. The future activity of the victim depends upon the extent these nerve cells are affected.\nNow, when we think of an epidemic, most of us are beset by fear that drives all reason from us and causes us to say and do things that, on sober thought, we never would do. With any sickness, it is wise to be careful and clean, but, with any sickness, it is foolish to become panicky. Poliomyelitis is a contagious disease, but, according to our present knowledge, it is not nearly so contagious as previously assumed. However, under our statutes, a polio patient must be isolated during the acute period so that he will not expose others to this serious infection.\nIt is believed by the medical profession that poliomyelitis virus is transmitted by common vectors or carriers. Dr. John R. Paul, an epidemician at the University of Utah, who has had considerable experience in epidemics, states that a survey which he made indicates that in the 1945 epidemic were traceable to four hundred cases reported during of contracting the disease through\ndirect contact is much less likely than formerly supposed.\nHowever, there are now hundreds of victims of infantile paralysis who need care and attention from trained personnel, and hundreds more this year will swell the ranks of those afflicted with this dread disease. Early diagnosis and specialized care are essential to the well-being of a polio patient.\nPhysiotherapy is now a must in the treatment of poliomyelitis. Under the direction of competent physicians, physiotherapists are helping patients to recover from this disease and assisting crippled victims to do the things which heretofore have been regarded as impossible. Through the efforts of our medical men and women, hundreds of boys and girls, who might have been hopelessly handicapped, now have the use of their arms and legs, and, from all appearances, are normal men and women.\nTechnicians must be recruited and trained without delay. To this end, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis has outlined a program for the recruiting and training of physiotherapists who will be available at the call of qualified physicians.\nThe Foundation has set aside the sum of $1,267,600 to be used for training men and women in the art of physiotherapy. These scholarships are now making it possible for people interested in the healing arts to acquire not only a dignified and lucrative profession, but also to become of immeasurable help to their fellow men. The National Foundation is very anxious that these scholarships be used.\nThe field is not limited to the treatment of poliomyelitis, but similar methods of treatment are being used in practically every branch of medical science. As our knowledge of diseases and their cause progresses, the need for physiotherapists becomes more obvious.\nScholarships for nine to twelve months' training at approved schools of physical education, covering expenses, books, and transportation, according to the needs of qualified students. Candidates for this specialized instruction must be capable of classification within one or more of the following groups:\n(a) Graduates of approved schools of physical education.\n(b) Graduates of schools of nursing.\n(c) Students who have completed two or more years of college work, including twelve semester hours in biology and the basic sciences.\nAnyone interested in these scholarships should communicate with the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Inc., 120 Broadway, New York City 5, New York, or, more directly, with the local state or county chapter.\nFor the hundreds who are now being helped by the limited force of properly trained nurses and aides, thousands of the healing arts are needed. There are not enough trained people\ncare for those now afflicted and the many others who will undoubtedly contract the disease in future epidemics.\nIn the treatment of poliomyelitis, the application of hot-packs from the beginning is now an essential process. These hot-packs, depending upon the condition of the patient, must be applied from four to twelve times a day. In case of an epidemic, we do not have enough trained people to do this work.\nThere are many women who lack the educational requirements and the time necessary for becoming professional physiotherapists. These women may help in the fight against infantile paralysis by training themselves as aids in the nursing profession. In this way many mothers and many future mothers may learn the healing arts of hot-pack application and bedside nursing.\nThere is only one center in Utah offering proper training for nurse' aids in the treatment of poliomyelitis at the present time. A program has been outlined whereby each county will send to Salt Lake City at least three women for a tentative intensive course in hot-packing and beside nursing of infantile paralysis victims. Several competent and experienced physicians, assisted by various social service and nursing groups, will supervise this essential training. The expenses of the women will be carried by the auxiliary chapters of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis which have been organized in every county in Utah. Living quarters will be provided. When these women have completed their training, they will be asked, under the direction of the county medical authorities, to organize classes and train other women to be prepared in case of an emergency. Remember the needs of our children. Volunteer in the service of the healing arts. No mother knows when the dread poliomyelitis may strike one of her own children. If she has had training in the essential nursing procedures, a mother may render her child a service that might not otherwise be available. If you are unable to get in touch with your local chapter officers, contact the State Representative, Room 250, Union Pacific Annex, 19 West South Temple Street, Salt Lake City 1, Utah, or telephone 3-3126. Let us go forward in the fight against disease. Let us protect our children and care for them. It is today that we must prepare for the emergencies of tomorrow. \"FOLLOW ME\" Rose Thomas Graham As Jesus walked with men along The shores of Galilee, There must have been a little child Who played there by the sea. As Jesus, standing on the Mount, Taught men, whose hearts were stirred, There must have been a little child Who hearkened to his word. As Jesus struggled up the hill Beneath his heavy load, There must have \"been a little child Who stumbled on the road. As Marys gathered round the tomb Where their Lord Jesus lay, There must have been a little child Who knelt alone to pray. Our Public Buildings Howard Barker Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, Salt Lake City Schools THE other day a five-year-old boy was \"helping\" his uncle with some carpenter work. The plane, Yankee drill, and other tools were very attractive. Without any preliminary discussion of the line of thought, the lad said, \"When you die, can I have these tools?\" His experience of the past two years in losing a father and grandmother had taught him that things outlive people. \" This might be called axiom number one in our evaluation of public buildings. Axiom number two follows very logically: of all the works of man, public buildings are among the most enduring. In spite of the disintegration of time and the elements, and even of world wars, the pyramids of Egypt, St. Peter's in Rome, the leaning tower in Pisa, and countless other structures built many generations ago are still with us. But how valuable are our public buildings? NORTH AND SOUTH EIGHTEENTH WARD, ENSIGN STAKE, SALT LAKE CITY Chapel Built 1901 Page  Are they worth maintaining in good condition? Or, is it less expensive in the long run to do. as many of us have done with our automobiles, get as much use out of them as we can for a short time and then turn them in on new ones? Some of our public buildings have been designed and built to last and serve a long time. Examples of this type in Salt Lake City are the temple, the Utah State Capitol, and the L. D. S. Church Administration Building. These can be expected to be practically as valuable after a hundred years as when they were built. They will require relatively low maintenance expenditures and they are not likely to suffer rapidly from obsolescence. They are examples of axiom number three: the better the construction, the less the cost oi maintenance. But let's talk about the average church, or school, or library, or city hall. When most of these were built their builders were probably thinking in terms of a useful life of about forty or fifty years. Many of these structures are well past that age. But, since they have been maintained fairly well, they are worth more dollars today than when built. Worth more dollars today? That's a pretty strong statement. But if it is true, Our buildings are certainly worth maintaining at a high standard. What are the facts? The present worth of a building can be fairly accurately determined if we know three things: (1) the year in which it was built, (2) its original cost, and (3) a logical estimate of its depreciation. For example, $42 bought as much in 1890 as did $100 in 1926, or as did $127 in 1944. Putting it another way, each $100 worth of building in 1890 is now worth about $302, or each $100 worth in 1926 is now worth about $127. That is, this would be the relationship if we neglect depreciation. But suppose the 1890 building should now be depreciated by fifty per cent. It would still be worth about one and a half times as much today as when built. We can then state axiom number four: buildings become worth more as the purchasing power of the dollar declines. Now as to depreciation. There are two major factors: wear and tear due to use and the elements, and obsolescence. Both of these factors can be largely overcome by replacing worn parts and by functional remodeling to meet current needs  To give an idea of the relationship of depreciation costs to total building valuations, the values for the Salt Lake City school district might be interesting. There are now about fifty buildings, having a total 1945 valuation of about $11,500,000. Many of these buildings are now more than fifty years old. But, due to lower construction costs when they were built as compared to now, and to the consistent spending of maintenance money for the improvement or replacement of floors, roofs, heating, plumbing, ventilating and lighting equipment, etc., practically all of these buildings are worth more dollars today than when they were erected. The total maintenance cost for a fifty-five year period has averaged about $1.25 per $100 valuation per year. In this connection, however, it should be kept in mind that the valuations used for this comparison have been based on annual appraisals of present value which take into account variations in construction costs, and also as accurate depreciation data as are available. ST. GEORGE STAKE TABERNACLE, ST. GEORGE, UTAH Built in   What about deferred maintenance? When a building needs painting, repairing, or the replacement of any part, nothing can be saved by waiting. In fact, deferred maintenance will not only increase the ultimate maintenance cost, but will eventually wipe out the capital investment. There's an old saying that When you need a thing you pay for it whether you buy it or not.\" Let's list that as axiom number six. Its author must have had a life-long experience maintaining buildings. Our discussion thus far has all been on the logic of maintaining our public buildings from the standpoint of economics. The facts overwhelmingly indicate that as long as a building is worth using it is worth maintaining. We cannot afford otherwise. But there is another point. Our buildings are our children inanimate, yes but we have created them. Our care of them is a pretty good index of how we live and how we think. Enter a strange house by the back door, and by the time you have reached the kitchen you will know what the living room will look like. Or, walk into the boiler room of a public building and you will know the custodian (and maybe the fellow the custodian works for). Yes, our public buildings are built to be used and enjoyed. In their planning and construction let us seek the best architectural and building talent available. Harmony of mass, color, and line can typify our culture and our hopes. FOURTEENTH WARD, SALT LAKE STAKE, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH Chapel Built in 1857 Good quality materials and workmanship can indicate our stability and our wisdom. But only good care can prove our thrift and our appreciation of the fine things of life. And, in the final analysis, this appreciation is measured in terms of such simple things as a broom, some soup, a hammer, a plane, a Yankee drill, a bucket of paint and a will to do.  Yes, Sonny, you can have my tools when I die, but remember, we can build a building in a year, but we have to take care of it for a century.  OCTOBER MAGIC Jeanette P. Parry October, the roving gypsy. Is here in my garden again, With scarfs of exotic color To tie on the hillside and glen. The valley wears a grape-blue veil, To hide the sadness in her heart; It is hard to see October go And with her jocund spirit part. Through dreamy, shifting, opal days The river dons a silver coat, And hosts of gold and crimson leaves Upon its placid surface float. The sun climbs down the autumn sky And leaves a flame-like afterglow, Soon winter's biting winds may sweep Across the frozen wastes of snow. Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, October 1, and October 15, 1885 \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women OF All Nations\" GIRLS, DON'T MISTAKE BRASS FOR GOLD: The bestowal of the affections of a woman is a strange subject, perhaps, to dilate upon, but one which, in my estimation, should be dwelt upon and discussed far more than it has hitherto been, for by the bestowal may come joy and happiness, or woe and heartache. Who would wish for shadow when she could have sunshine?... Then why should we not be more wise and discreet in the choice of a husband, when, by the selection, may come life-long sorrow, tears, and wishes for an early grave.... Then we should be careful not to mistake brass for gold... To be sure that we have the real, genuine metal; then we are more confident of happiness. Ida. RESPONSE Love on! Love on! In life's maturer age, When time with iron pen fills up the page, O'er which we sigh and often drop the tear. As scenes are shifting by us year by year.  Hannah T. King  SCENES AND INCIDENTS AT WINTER QUARTERS: Lately, in looking over some old papers, I found a letter of exhortation and counsel to father's family.... Itis dated August 22nd, 1846, my eighteenth birthday, and had been preserved among father's papers: Now I shall require these things at your hands... Cease from vanity, seek humility and meekness, bow before the Lord in the morning and at eve, and in so doing your days may be many, peace and tranquility shall soothe your bosoms, health and happiness shall dwell in thy wagons, tents, wigwams and cottages, while these things are observed. Cease from murmuring or complaining, finding fault with your friend or with each other, but manifest to all men and women, by your works and the closeness of your tongues, and the integrity of your hearts, that you are right, and that God is with us of a truth. I always do, and shall expect that those which constitute my house, will remember me before the Lord, that I may have wisdom, health, patience, endurance... That I may always give suitable counsel to my family. Heber C. Kimball.  Helen Mar (Kimball) Whitney. A GOOD TESTIMONY: Fault-finding does not enhance our peace of mind, and it almost invariably disturbs that of those we most desire to promote. If we wish to be loved and trusted, then let us love and trust in return; and be sure that the best and truest way of pure happiness is to suffer wrong rather than do wrong Violet Owens. Page 600 Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon A MOVEMENT is on in our country to bring education into closer co-operation with daily living, national business, labor, professional, religious, and other organizations. Plans are under way for choosing committees to meet and advise with the United States Office of Education. Miss Margaret A. Hickey, President of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, is one of the representatives of the business groups. A FORMER Salt Lake woman, Dr. Beulah Ream Allen, who was living in the Phillipines in 1940, was rescued with her two sons from the Santo Tomas prison camp. The former Miss Ream put herself through medical school, principally by night-duty nursing, though medical school authorities feel that even a man cannot successfully work his way through medical training with its rigorous demands. Dr. Allen's second son was born in the prison camp. Her husband, captured at Bataan, is believed to have died in the Cabantuan camp. MORE and more Latin-American women are assuming leadership in civic, intellectual, and artistic life. Santiago, capital of Chile, has had a woman mayor, the wife of Oscar Schnake. A number of highly gifted women among our good neighbors attended the San Francisco Conference. Senora Isabel Sanchez de Urdaneta was a pioneer in introducing kindergartens into Venezuela. Dr. Berta Lutz of Brazil is a famous scientist and feminist. Senora Isabel P. De Vidal is a member of the National Senate of Uruguay. Senora Adela Formoso de Obregon Santacilia is president and founder of the Women's University, Mexico. MANY of Utah's daughters are winning recognition for outstanding achievements. Dr. Lenore Richards shows a marked talent for surgery. She is the first woman ever to be accepted in the Teaching Surgical Service of the Cincinnati State Medical School with service at the Cincinnati General Hospital. Dr. Richards instructs and is continuing her own specialized studies. MRS. Elaine Stevenson Michelsen, while living temporarily in Hartford, Connecticut, was invited to exhibit her paintings at the Hartford Public Library on the occasion of the commemoration of its founding. Moving with her husband to Seattle, Washington, she became a successful art instructor there. A USEFUL and interesting book is Home-School Relations, written by Dr. Ernest G. Osborne and Sarah E.

With the reported cessation of hostilities in Japan and the Far East, once more the healing wings of peace are enfolding the world. And, although many of the fighting forces still remain far from their native hearthstones, the comforting assurance has come to their loved ones that no longer are they called upon to face the horrors and destruction of a total war. The year A. D. 1945 will ever mark the close of an old era?one of sorrow and grief for the mothers of men?and the beginning of a new era. The unleashing of a new force in the final phase of the war, whose future power either for good or evil seems to be incalculable, foreshadows the new world era. If the inhabitants of the earth turn to righteousness, and this power is harnessed and developed for the good of man, its future use may prove a blessing to humanity In the hands of wicked and ungodly men, however, the development of this new force, as evidenced in the action of the atomic bomb, may result in the utter destruction of the human race. Such a supposition recalls to the minds of Latter-day Saints the words of the Lord: For I, the Almighty, have laid my hands upon the nations, to scourge them for their Page 602 wickedness. And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from the earth until I have completed my work, which shall be cut short in righteousness (Doc. And Gov. 84:96-97). May the prayers of the righteous ascend upward in ceaseless supplication that a spirit of righteousness may abide in the hearts of mankind. The assurance of peace at this time brings a spirit of joy and thanksgiving to Relief Society members throughout the world. Faithfully and well through these past years have they carried on the work of the Society. With their own hearts torn and their sensibilities at times harrowed up almost beyond endurance, they have continued to meet together, oftimes under difficult conditions, to relieve the distress of the less fortunate and to mingle their fears, doubts, hopes, and even tears, in a closeness of spirit. They have added to their ability to carry on from the truths of the gospel they have been taught and from increasing the strength of their testimonies. Those women whose wounds will never entirely heal, who have been called upon to bear the supreme loss of a loved father, husband, or son, unselfishly rejoice in the happiness of their sisters and the blessings still remaining to them. With the removal, of the terrible anxiety which has oppressed the EDITORIAL 603 spirits of the women of the Church, and with restrictions on meetings lifted, there must come to Relief Society a great upwelling and resurgence of power. The future lies ahead unknown, but all the calls that may come to the Society will be met if members answer every call made upon them as individuals. Each day the Church Welfare Plan broadens and deepens. The part of Relief Society women in this Plan is great. The responsibility of the Society in saving souls by teaching and living the gospel, is also great. Only by a rededication by the women of the Church?the young ones as well as the older ones?to the work of Relief Society will it be able to fulfill its destiny in the years ahead. Endowed with the grace of humble hearts and contrite spirits, the women of the Church everywhere will work together?for only through their magnificent, united accomplishments will the unbounded potentialities of Relief Society be realized. And the righteousness of the daughters of Zion will be pleasing unto the Lord. M. C. S. THE fall time, the waning of the year, to some people foreshadows a season of dryness and decay, to be followed by the blanketing numbness of winter. So it appeared to the poet Bryant who lamented: The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year; Of wailing winds and naked woods, and meadows brown and sere. To such people the fall seems a dread season, a time of regret and heartache, of farewell to happy, carefree days, and a time to shoulder the burdens which are waiting. The word \"fall\" itself connotes a time of decline, an ebbing away of the fulness, a gradual withdrawing of pulsating life which leaves behind but a hardened shell, an empty husk, and a baren waste. To others, the third quarter of the year is best described by the term new ?John Banister Tabb \"autumn,\" an uncertain time, typifying the unpredictable, the colorful, whirling, restless season of the year when activities which have been slumbering in the hot, languorous days of summer are revived; when the blood quickens in tempo with the biting winds without, and energy and spirit are renewed. The keen expectancy of a new school year with friendships and pleasures still untested, seems to pervade the very air. The snatching of unlearned books, the rushing out to meet playmates, the boisterous chatter of children, gaily attired in plaids and brilliant sweaters to match the kaleidoscopic colors of the foliage, punctuates the stillness of the morning. The noontide quiet is shattered by the calls of the released boys and girls who run home, sniffing and exclaiming over the sharpness of pepper-red chili sauce, the acrid tang of pickles or the cloying sweetness of preserves, and the unforgettable odor of freshly baked bread. The dancing leaves outside the kitchen door cast a living applique of shadow over the luncheon scene. Tempting samples from bottles whose contents are to be more fully enjoyed in the long months ahead, make these occasions ones to be cherished and recalled in future years. Such sunny, bright days may be interrupted by days of winds and rain, when the family gathers in close companionship around a crackling grate fire, and gratitude wells up in the hearts of the surrounding half circle for the plenty and security found within the beloved home. And after such days of blustery rains and squalls comes a ring of days, each one a jewel reflecting russet, saffron, taffeta tans or tawny orange, with here and there the glowing red of the sumac on the hill, all set in a gleaming band of maple gold. The season of all seasons?Indian summer. Then, as the days grow short and night shadows lengthen, the blaze of color painted by the Master Artist is swept away by the mighty brush of winds, and the mind comes to accept the changelessness of changes?of the season, moods, and circumstances. Over the glory of the beauty that was autumn imperceptibly but surely steals the gaunt, stark beauty of the winter. One is. Led to acknowledge the hand of the Lord over all in the inevitableness and lightness of the changes that enter into the lives of his children, as in the seasons, and to accept, with thankfulness, the sorrows, as well as the joys, of mortality. M. C. S. AN UNWEEDED GARDEN Caroline Eyring Miner How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable, Seems to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't! Oh fie, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! Were these lines written in 1945, before the end of the war? No, but they might have been as far as their application is concerned, and yet they were penned by the hand of Shakespeare in the sixteenth century. Unbelievable, do I hear you say, that our mechanized and scientific world should have come from that unweeded garden of the sixteenth century? And yet it did. On the same foundation, may we not hope that four hundred years from now it will seem unbelievable to our descendants that out of the economic and social chaos of 1945, the idealistic order of that day could have come? Nevertheless, I believe it will be said. NOTES TO THE FIELD Relief Society Singing Activities Encouraged IT is gratifying to know that, despite these strenuous times, so many of the Relief Society singing groups have remained intact and have been able to keep their membership and often have increased it. We realize that due to the restrictive conditions that have been brought about because of the war this has not been possible in some areas.\nThe General Board appreciates the fine leadership and effort that have been put into the organizations of the Singing Mothers and that have made them distinctive and valuable.\nThose who participate in these singing groups receive many cultural benefits as well as rendering worthy service to the Relief Society and\nto the Church in general. This was definitely emphasized by our beloved President Grant in the following lines:\nThe singing of our sacred hymns written by the servants of God has a powerful effect in converting people to the principles of the gospel and in promoting peace and spiritual growth. Singing is a prayer to the Lord, as He has said: \"For any soul delighteth in the song of the heart: yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.\"\nWe therefore hope that every Relief Society member who is able to sing will affiliate herself with these singing groups and receive the blessings and inspiration of such endeavor. TAWDRY JADE Courtney E. Cottam Oh, Autumn is a tawdry jade, Ragged skirts aflutter. Her hair unkempt, and 'round her feet Summer's useless clutter. * She dresses in a tawny red, Gypsy-gay, and bright. Spurning pastel shades of spring And winter's pristine white. Her heart is warm, and through her hands Pours the harvest yield. Garnered by this tawdry jade From fruiting tree and field. Page 605 And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER V SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, who has not divulged the fact that her fiance, Hugh Temple, wants to break their engagement, is condemned by the townsfolk for what they consider an unseemly interest in Jeff Holden. In order to show them that Jeff means nothing to her, and yet save her face in the affair with Hugh, Delsa decides to appear captivated by Alec Windsor, a marine visiting Delsa's friend, Jim Lewis. THE whole town was excited over Jim's and Lina's wedding. No one was so small, so unimportant, that he didn't have a part in the preparations that now went forward. Jim and Lina were to go to Salt Lake City on Thursday and be married in the temple. Then they would return home, and that evening a big reception would be given for them. Not only was the whole town invited?but the whole valley, as well. Friends and relatives from far and near would gather in the ward amusement hall to wish the young couple happiness, and to dance and eat. \"It's going to be a real, old-fashioned wedding,\" Lina told Delsa happily. \"Dad and Mother think it would be nice to have a get-together like they used to have, years ago. In spite of rationing, some of the women think they can get up a good, hot meal. There'll be dancing and a program?everyone who wants to take part on the program can.\" Delsa smiled. \"I wonder if you know what you're Page 606 letting yourself in for?\" she asked. 'Tve heard Mother tell of those old-time affairs?they lasted a good part of the night. You'll be tired after the day in Salt Lake?going through the temple and all.\" \"I don't care!\" Lina said, \"if Mother and Dad and Jim's folks want an old-time party again, we'll give it to them. We've been so sober for so long. We're going to be happy and all together again for once!\" Talk of the wedding even permeated the schoolroom and grounds. Nellie Gibson was learning a recitation to say at Lina's wedding, and the girls' quartet was practicing a song. Delsa stayed after school and played the piano for them. Jeff came over and leaned his elbows on the piano and beat time for the girls, watching Delsa over the bright heads of the youngsters. After the practicing was over, Jeff and Delsa walked down the road toward Jeff's house together. Jeff said, with a strange urgency in his voice, \"Are you going to let me take you to the wedding, Delsa?\" Delsa laughed, surprise giving a ring to her voice. \"Oh, Jeff! You know I don't go anywhere with anyone!\" Jeff smiled wryly. \"I should think you could go with your principal without hurting your conscience at all. Goodness knows, Delsa, I haven't any idea of beating Hugh's time. It's just that everyone will be going and I thought Delsa put her hand impulsively \"How has the town been treating on Jeffs arm. You?\" Delsa put her hand impulsively on Jeff's arm.\n\"It's all right, Jeff,\" she said. She had remembered, then, that she was no longer bound to Hugh. She could go to the dance with anyone she chose. She felt suddenly cold and alone.\nJEFF must have been watching her face more closely than she knew for he spoke quickly. \"Don't look like that, Delsa. Hugh'll be back one of these days and then we'll all be dancing at your wedding. I'm sorry I made you unhappy.\"\nThey went on in silence, each busy with his own thoughts, until they reached Jeff's gate and Davy came running to meet them.\nBut when Delsa's work at Jeff's had been done and she went out into the clear blue night, she was startled to see a man's form leaning over the gate, obviously waiting for her. She knew at once that it wasn't Jeff; and almost as immediately she knew who it was?Alec Windsor, the forest green of his marine uniform dark against the starlit sky.\n\"Hello, there!\" he said happily, familiarly, as if he had waited for her every night for years.\nDelsa smiled up at him. \"This is a surprise!\" she cried. \"It's been a long, long time since there were young men in town with leisure to lean on gates!\"\nHe answered soberly, \"It's been a long, long time since I had leisure to lean on a gate, I assure you. But now that I do have the leisure, I am going to make good use of it.\"\nHe fell into step beside her and they walked up the wind-tossed path to Marriott home.\n\"How has the town been treating you?\" Delsa asked, for want of something better to say.\n\"Fine!\" he laughed. \"Only everyone is so busy with Jim and Lina and plans for the wedding, I've had to shift for myself a bit today. Not that I mind,\" he hastened to add, \"but I had plenty of time to remember you and how pretty you looked last night with that blue ribbon in your hair. Gosh,\" he went on, \"what you girls could teach those South Sea natives?or could you?\"\nDelsa laughed. It was definitely pleasant to have someone to walk with in the cool spring evening. And when Alec took her arm and drew her a little closer to his side, she felt the old, half-forgotten thrill of being liked and protected.\nThey walked slowly, talking of many things, and when they reached Delsa, she turned and looked up at the tall, dark, serious boy who reminded her so much of Hugh.\n\"Come in and have supper with us,\" she invited.\nHe hesitated a moment, and then smiled like a little boy caught in mischief.\n\"Thanks,\" he said.\n\"But I can get Dad to step over and tell your friends . . .\" she began, but he grinned more broadly.\n\"I've already told them that I might not be home to supper,\" he said. \"I had hopes.\"\n\"Oh, you marines!\" Delsa laughed, and opened the door.\nHer parents were happy to have a young man at the table again, and the meal went gaily. Afterward, Alec put on one of Mrs. Marriott's aprons and wiped the dishes for Delsa. \"WHEN the kitchen was shipshape and Delsa would have gone into the living room where her parents were, Alec stopped her. \"Let's sit here in the kitchen/\" he suggested. \"Gosh, it's been so long since I sat in a real kitchen!\" He sniffed audibly. \"I like the smell of it!\" So they drew up chairs and sat beside the table with its red-checked cloth, and talked, with Alec getting up now and then to put sticks of wood into the big, old-fashioned stove. After a while Delsa said, \"It's rather late in the year for popping corn?we generally do that in the winter time. But we still have some good corn left?and it's always fun!\" So they popped corn and sprinkled it with salt and with homemade, unrationed butter, and ate it in big handfuls. But at last Alec had to go. He frowned at the big wooden clock ticking away persistently on the kitchen shelf, and said, \"You're a school marm, and I know what modern kids are. You'll need all the reinforcement of a good night's sleep to handle them, I bet.\" Delsa smiled. \"These children aren't bad,\" she said. \"They are just the town kids?I've known them all ever since they were born. I've taught them in Sunday School and Primary?and they aren't spoiled like city children. They all have plenty of work to do in their homes ?it makes them more responsible and obedient.\" He looked at her wonderingly. \"You really like them, don't you?\" he asked. \"I wonder if I ever had a teacher that really liked me?\" \"Of course you did, silly!\" Delsa said with a sudden tightening of her throat. Alec reached across the table and put his big, brown, hard hand over hers. \"Who's taking you to the wedding dance, Delsa?\" he asked gently. THERE it was, her chance, handed to her on a silver platter. But she couldn't take it?not just yet. Delsa thought of Hugh and of Jeff. She could go with Alec?but that was so sudden. It might fool her mother and Hugh's mother, who wanted her to be attracted by the newcomer; but it wouldn't fool Jeff Holden. He would think she had refused him and then had accepted Alec's invitation to show him that she didn't care for him at all? that she didn't want even to trust him as her escort to Jim's and Lina's wedding. She shook her head gently. \"No one,\" she said. \"I go with Mother and Dad.\" Alec opened his hand, which now held hers, and looked down at her fingers. Hugh's ring, a simple little token?but all that she had wanted ? circled her finger. The tiny diamond winked up at Alec, like a bright tear. \"He's pretty wonderful, I'll bet, to have a girl like you waiting for him.\" Delsa felt that she ought to defend her position, somehow. She began, hesitatingly, \"And there's Millie, Alec. Oh, I don't want to point out your social obligations-it's not that?but I know Millie would feel hurt if you took me?\" A sudden smile broke across Alec's dark features, and he squeezed her hand gently. \"You're absolutely (Continued on page 620) Flowers and Fruit for the Table Adele Matheson AT the table the family gains the fuel for living. Children grow and develop from its bounties. Three times each day, through all seasons, parents, children, relatives, and friends come together to participate in the all-essential requirement for physical survival. What, then, must be the importance of this homely routine? What can be done to lift this commonplace function into a less prosaic experience? The piquancy of well-selected and carefully prepared food is an indispensable requirement. Beyond this, resourcefulness, art, and skill must be constantly employed to give surprise and zest to table arrangements. The mother-hostess must never give way to the mere \"feeding of the family\" routine. Never should our loved ones be called to surround a \"tired table.\" Color is a pleasant invitation to happy dining. Its use is not expensive, and color demands no drudgery. Use color in flowers and fruit, in dishes and table linen. Create colorful food combinations and watch the effect of lifted spirits and congenial gaiety when the diners see the fresh beauty that beckons them to the table. Suggestions for good table setting ?may come from the particular meal, the season, or the occasion. Photograph courtesy W. Atlee Burpee CREAMY YELLOW COSMOS AGAINST THE CORAL PINK OF A FLUTED SHELL ?Photograph courtesy W. Atlee Burpee PALE YELLOW AND GOLDEN GAILLARDIAS IN CREAM-WHITE BOWL Holidays and birthdays, the wedding anniversary, Sunday dinner, a fireside supper, breakfast on the porch?all provide an opportunity for the alert and loving housekeeper to portray her artistic ability. The table covering, whether it be a cloth or runners, is the background for the setting of china and accessories. The linens may vary according to the meal?breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Faultlessly-ironed linens contribute much to the charm of a table setting. For dinners, and particularly for formal occasions, white linens are always correct. However, the delicately tinted rayons so popular at present provide a rich background which makes the table fairly sparkle. Hand-blocked peasant linens in gay floral patterns and fruit motifs offer a wide choice in the selection of an inexpensive covering to be used for the breakfast table. Set with gaily colored pottery, such a table presents an invitation to enjoyment which stimulates the day's activities. 'INHERE is never a meal where floral decorations are out of place, never a buifet supper nor a children's party that is not made more attractive by artistic flower arrangements. These decorative centerpieces should be simple, composed of clear, bright colors, entirely cheerful in effect. Nasturtiums, intermixed with their crisp green leaves, are appetite-inspiring flowers. The simplest arrangement is suitable for the informal luncheon. A few sprays of asters or cosmos, if placed in an appropriate container, will make a FLOWERS AND FRUIT FOR THE TABLE 611 lovely centerpiece for this meal. Calendulas and marigolds reflect the warmth and brilliance of the autumn season. The ingenuity of the mother-hostess is put to the test in the choice of flowers which may be available in the family garden plot. Charming center decorations may be made by placing one or two dahlias or chrysanthemums in a shallow dish filled with water. Pansies, also, provide an attractive center of interest by cutting the stems and letting the petals float on the water. Petunias, in their gay multicolors, are a delight, and they adapt themselves to almost any type of container. Autumn is particularly lavish in its gifts of color and beauty. Grains of all kinds, in their golden splendor, offer endless opportunities for attractive table decorations. Feathery oats, in gleaming yellow, against a blue bowl make a picture not soon forgotten. Weed stems, red berries, colored leaves, are gifts from autumn ?gifts that we may bring inside our homes. Fruit arrangements are at all times appealing. Luscious grapes are irresistibly tempting, especially in clusters of green and purple which can be draped gracefully over the edge of a bowl. Mixed fruits, such as oranges, bananas, apples, pears, and peaches do not lack in decorative appeal. Fruits of contrasting form should be selected for combinations. There should usually be a preponderance of one kind of fruit, with color and line accents of other kinds. Whatever type of centerpiece is selected, the arrangement should never be high enough to obstruct the view across the table. DINING TABLE WITH FRUIT CENTERPIECE Picture taken at Lion House, Salt Lake City. Dining room decoration by Mary Grant Judd Also, it should not be so flat that it does not display itself to advantage. If the table is long, several small arrangements may be more effective than a single elaborate centerpiece.\nCandles for the dinner table provide a festive touch, but they should be used only in the evening when artificial light is required. For intimate occasions the light from the fireplace may be sufficient for the evening meal.\nWhile individual ingenuity must be depended upon for variety and results, there are certain basic rules for table setting. The linen, china, and silver required will depend upon the meal and the menu. However, the placing of the napkins, silver, china, and glassware is the same for all occasions. The napkin is folded simply?large napkins with the monogram up, and smaller napkins with the long side toward the plate.\nSilver is placed on the table at the beginning of a meal only for the courses which are served before the tines up, and all knives and spoons to the right of the individual setting. They should be laid at right angles to the edge of the table, about an inch from the edge. The blades of the knives should be turned toward the plate. Each piece of silver should be laid in the order in which it is to be used, from the outside in. If more silver is required it should be placed upon the table immediately before the course for which it will be used. The tumbler or goblet for water should be placed an inch above and slightly to the right of the largest knife. Butter plates should be placed to the left and above the forks, with the butter knife lying across the rim of the butter plate.\nPleasure may be found in doing anything well. The three times daily task of table setting may be made pleasant and adventurous by using materials readily available for bringing beauty to the table. Let us serve our families with thoughtfulness and artistic planning.ORPHANED Dott J. Sartori The maple lets her green-winged fledgings fly Aslant the autumn?s fitful atmosphere. Sightless, they ride among the enemy And conquering soar into the coming year. Now frost and thought of future goading her The gentian floats her parachutist free, Trusting to filaments of gossamer A century's emerald genealogy. The future is flung into the couch of fall? The green world's minute infants swaddled tight In sheaths of brown, impervious but small? To brave alone the winter and the night. THE BOTTOM DRAWER 613 The Bottom Drawer (Continued from page 591) and sat on the floor beside her cedar chest. She took out all her beautiful things and looked at them one by one. What dreams and hopes she had put into them and now they seemed to be the barrier between her and Bart. With a sigh, she replaced them carefully. I'd better get back to bed, she thought. No matter how I feel I must be on hand to teach the children in the morning. One afternoon the next week when Majel got home she found Grandma lying on the couch gasping for breath. The doctor looked grave as he said accusingly, \"You?ve been worrying about something.\" To Majel at the door, he said, \"It's this war. Keep her from thinking about it. She can stand about one more attack like that.\" Majel went back and knelt by the couch. She smoothed back the soft white hair. \"You've been worrying about me,\" she said. \"Well, you just get well and I'll be all right.\" As she got dinner she thought back over the thirteen years she had lived with her grandmother. She must have been a trial at first and a great responsibility. Grandma might have had a very different life without her? trips and friends of her own age. She shouldn't have let Grandma put her through college either. She knew now that she had done right in staying. Bart's letters came now at irregular intervals, sometimes three weeks apart. They were interesting, though, telling of places around New York he visited, of dances at the field. But he never used the extravagant terms of endearment that had so amused her, and he never mentioned the future. Soon after school was out in June, a different kind of letter came. He wrote, \"Sometimes when I'm ten thousand feet up I have the strangest impulse to turn west and fly straight back to you. Instead, I'll probably soon be moving east where I can't even be sure of your prim, sweet little letters.\" This was too much for Majel. She went to her room and cried a long time. When Grandma called her to dinner her eyes were still red but Grandma seemed not to notice. It was not until they were clearing the table that she asked, \"You got a letter, didn't you?\" Majel said, \"Yes.\" \"Is he about through at Long Island?\" Another \"yes\" was all Majel could manage. They were washing the dishes when Grandma spoke again. \"You know what I'd do? I'd go and marry him before he goes. I'd fly to get there.\" Nothing in Majel's life had ever surprised her so much. \"Why, Grandma,\" she faltered. \"You?ve always said such marriages weren't decent.\" GRANDMA interrupted impatiently. \"I can change, can't I? I'm in this war, too, and everybody says war changes people.\" \"But he hasn't asked me to come,\" Majel objected. Grandma seemed not to hear. \"You could leave tomorrow and you needn't worry about me. I'm going to visit Cousin Clara. I've already written to her.\"\nThen Majel laughed and hugged her tight. \"You're not fooling me a bit,\" she said, \"but I'll do it. You start packing while I get reservations.\"\nWhen Majel saw Bart all her confidence left her. But his hug and kiss were ardent enough. He guided her over towards the cafe saying, \"We'll get something to eat while the baggage is being sorted.\"\nNot until they were through did he demand, \"Now tell me, what's the idea?\"\n\"Is it too late?\" Majel asked, scarcely above a whisper.\n\"You surely don't mean you'd marry me now when you wouldn't three months ago. Why, we could have only two or three days together.\"\nMajel spoke rapidly. \"You thought it was a home with nice things I wanted. But it wasn't. All those things in my 'bottom drawer' were just?just something to keep me busy while I waited. I could be happy with you in an auto court even. It was my contract. If was my responsibility to Grandma. Oh, Bart, I've been so unhappy because you didn't understand.\"\n\"Understand?\" At last he said, \"Maybe I do now. I've done a lot of thinking.\" He paused?then laughed. \"Why, I suppose, marriage to you is a sort of contract and ?and?a responsibility.\"\n\"Yes, oh, yes,\" she said.\n\"And I could be sure of having a wife waiting for me when the war is over?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Oh, my dear, I guess I like you just the way you are.\" He took from his pocket a little green velvet box. In it were two rings?one with a large diamond and the other a band. As Majel watched with shining eyes, he took out the engagement ring, reached across the table for her hand and slipped the ring on.\n\"There,\" he said, \"I've had them three months.\" Then his voice took on a familiar, teasing tone. \"Not that I haven't tried to find someone in New York to give them to.\"\nWhen Majel heard that tone she knew that everything was right between them. She brushed. \"No one would look twice at you. They could all see the sign 'taken' right across your forehead.\"\nBart got up. \"Come on,\" he said, \"I understand it takes time to get married in New York and we haven't a minute to lose.\" OCHRE LEAVES Ruby Baird Andersen In zeal, my neighbors heaped their leaves in mounds Then watched them go, in curling, smoky spires; And smugly thought: \"How neat?my grounds.\" Not I, to burn such gold in sacrificial pyres. What though the flame of autumn soon expires, Remembered still are buds that April knows, And sound of wind on summer's leafy lyres. Deserving now, these leaves, of some repose, Intimate with earth and kindly fallen snows. Notes FROM THE FIELD Blanche B.

Bonneville Stake (Utah) A DELE MATHESON reported a pageant she directed, given at the Relief Society conference in the Garden Park chapel, November 5, 1944. 'The theme was inspired by the current study of biblical literature in the regular Relief Society outline. The material, covering, in effect, the complete life of Christ, was selected by President preserved throughout by the writer: Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist, appearing first, related the remarkable incidents concerning the birth of her son, and the prophecies forecasting the advent of the Savior.

The beauty and simplicity of the biblical expression was GARDEN PARK WARD, BONNEVILLE STAKE, PRESENTS PAGEANT The five women most important in the life of Christ tell their own story in tableau, dialogue, and song at the Relief Society conference in Garden Park Ward, Bonneville Stake, November 5, 1944. These characters, most beloved by the Savior, were played by left to right: Florence Hill as Martha; Lucile Cederlof as Mary; Adele Matheson as Mary, mother of Jesus; Ruth Romney' as Elizabeth; in front. Lota Lamoreaux as Mary Magdalene. The production was written by Genet B. Dee, President of Garden Park Relief Society, and was produced by Adele Matheson. Poge  Mary, the mother of Jesus, unfolded the marvelous story of the miracle of the coming of the Son of God. She told the appealing and human story of the mother and her son from his birth and childhood to his tragic crucifixion. The raising of Lazarus from the dead and the sojourn of the Savior within their humble home, was skillfully depicted in conversation between Martha and Mary. The story of Mary Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, was recalled in its forceful simplicity and the dramatic summary of the scene at the cross which concluded the story. \"Appropriate musical numbers interspersed the program: 'A Voice in the Wilderness? 'Prepare Ye the Way/ and 'He is Risen/ were rendered by Elaine Tomlinson; 'I Think When I Read That Sweet Story of Old/ by Wanda Gibb; 'Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?' rendered by the Garden Park Girls' Chorus; and 'I Know That My Redeemer Liveth sung by Edward O. Piatt. \"The authentic costumes, together with appropriate background and music, contributed to an atmosphere of dignified solemnity, and through the spoken word the characters appeared to actually live their parts. The effect upon the hearers was one of profound reverence. Particularly impressive was the final scene at the cross.\" RELIEF SOCIETY PRESIDENCY, BELLINGHAM WARD, SEATTLE STAKE (WASHINGTON) Left to right: Thelma Umphenour, secretary-treasurer; Ella M.

But this won't keep you from dancing with me, will it?\" and he frowned at the little ring. \"Of course not,\" Delsa laughed. \"I love to dance, do you?\" He nodded, and let go of her hand. Rising, he reached for his cap, which he had hung on a hook behind the door when he came in. Delsa followed him, and as he stood, waiting to leave, twirling his cap in his two hands, Delsa thought, how lonely he is! How alone and away from all the folks that love him ?his mother?his sweetheart! That's the way Hugh was, down there in Australia! She laid her hands on his arm, feeling the rough texture of the cloth beneath her palms. \"Drop in any time,\" she said. \"If you feel lonely, come here. The Lewises, of course, are wrapped up in their plans for Jim?but we have nothing to distract us. Mother and Dad would love it?\" He bent toward her in that slanting, eager posture so like Hugh's and said, \"It's been a wonderful evening, Delsa. And I am going to take you at your word?I am going to drop in here often. I only wish I could go to school, too!\" A FTER he was gone Delsa went slowly upstairs to her room, but her mother called to her from her AND FOR ETERNITY 621 bedroom, and Delsa turned and went in. \"He's a nice boy,\" her mother said, with a little gesture that reminded Delsa of the past?of the many nights she had come in from a dance or a party to sit on the pieced coverlet and tell her mother and father of the good time she had had. T But Delsa didn't sit down tonight?the old easy confidence was gone? gone with Hugh?though her mother didn't know it yet. Now between them lay a shadow of restraint and, perhaps, deceit. So Delsa stood beside the bed, ignoring that gentle gesture, and said, \"He's had a tough time, out there.\" \"I could see that,\" her father went on, and his gruff voice was gentle. \"I don't suppose he told you much about the fighting? It's terrible?I can't help thinking of all our boys?\" Delsa patted his heavy, calloused hand where it lay on the coverlet. \"You took yours in the last war. Dad,\" she said softly. \"I guess the boys can take theirs now.\" They talked a little longer, and Delsa stooped and kissed her parents before she went out of the room. Somehow, tonight, she felt sorrier for them than for herself. They both loved Hugh so much. He had taken the place of the son they had never had, and her father had been the only father Hugh had known. \"If it were only my problem alone!\" she whispered, \"I could go away?I could even face it here. But it is theirs, too. Hugh, Hugh, did you forget Dad?did you forget the pony he gave you when you were ten?the days you have helped him stack hay?the way he taught you to box and wrestle so you could hold your own with the bigger boys? Did you forget mother? and her cookies and her presents?her affection that gave you two mothers where less fortunate boys have but one?\" She knelt by the window, looking out over the trees to where the snowy crest of the mountain that guarded the valley stood pale and white in the moonlight. Between the mountain and her window lay the acres of her father's farm, and beyond them other acres, and then the road and the foothills where she and Hugh had gone Eastering and May walking and hunting pine nuts and cutting Christmas trees. \"I am not a dog in the manger,\" she told herself at last, \"hanging onto Hugh when he is tired of me and wants to be free. I am remembering my parents and Aunt Martha?and I am holding on for them, too.\" Suddenly she bent her head onto her arms and cried, \"And for you, too, Hugh?Oh, now, tonight, I know how you must have felt, out there. And, tonight, I don't blame that girl so much?I know how she must have felt, too.\" To be continued) Work Meeting Plan Now for Christmas DOLLS AND MENAGERIES OUT OF A SCRAP BAG LAST month on this page suggestions were given for holding a successful apron day in work meeting to help members style and make aprons for Christmas giving. That activity had been planned and carried out by Sister Thelma Kam-merman, work director of Parley's Ward, Highland Stake. The General Board believes that by sponsoring different types of sewing activities in work meetings, all members of Relief Society, the young as well as the older, may become actively interested in sewing and take part in the sewing program of Relief Society. This month Sister Melvina Sheets describes another type of sewing activity for providing Christmas gifts which was carried on very successfully in her ward. \"If you were to have visited the Highland Park Ward, Highland Stake, on the second Tuesday of last October, you would have had a glimpse of busy mothers, grandmothers ? yes, even great-grandmothers all enthusiastically working. Some were cutting, some sewing, others pulling bits of white fluffy cotton from large bats and stuffing it firmly into varied shapes for legs, arms, heads, tails, ears and bodies. Stuffed toys were in the making! Page 622 There were dolls with embroidered faces, short and tall Raggedy Anns and Andys, baby dolls, upside-down dolls, and a big doll?a girl thirty-two inches tall, complete with panties, slip, dress, and bonnet, or perhaps with a large bow in her yarn hair. There were brunettes, blondes, and redheads, a complexion to suit anyone's choice. \"Cuddly animal toys proved to be popular with the younger mothers, such as: Jumbo, the elephant with his great floppy ears?with a tiny Jumbo, too; the long-necked giraffe and baby with ruffled manes; Scotty, the bow-wow dog; the pony so proud of his long yarn mane and tail; the teddy bear; Peter Rabbit with his pink eyes, ears, and nose; but better still, the white wooly lamb with colored face and tummy which proved to be a favorite with everyone. \"It was while helping my niece make a set of rag dolls for her tiny daughter that the idea had come to me that this might be an answer to the Christmas suggestion question. I had immediately gone pattern hunting and had been pleasantly surprised to find so many patterns for different animals and dolls. I also cut additional patterns in order to have plenty on hand so that everyone one would be able to keep busy and happy.\nIn order to know the amount of material needed and to familiarize myself with each pattern, I made up one article of each pattern. Being very thrilled and satisfied with my menagerie, I placed the toys on display at our next Relief Society meeting. Thus began weeks of work and fun. Each mother, grandmother, sister, or great-grandmother was anxious to make the toy of her choice.\n\"I asked for pieces of material ranging from one and a half yards to only a quarter of a yard, and these were put in a scrap bag to be used as needed. We used peach-colored washable chintz for the faces, arms, and legs of the dolls. This I purchased, along with the cotton bats for stuffing, the string yarns (black, brown, yellow, and rust) for the hair, and the large, white bath towels for the little lambs. It was found that five lambs could be cut from two towels.\n\"Our project was most successful. A repeat program of this type has been requested, and we are planning to make an entire beginner's class next year.\""

LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 12?Building an Empire in the West Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, January 8, 1946 Objective: To indicate the continued fulfillment of prophecy concerning the gathering of Israel. THE day which followed the arrival of the first company of saints into the valley of the Great Salt Lake was the Sabbath. Fittingly enough this should have been so, for these were a people who had chosen the Lord for their king. In their struggling efforts to establish his kingdom in the East, the Mormon people had found nothing but bitter opposition. Therefore, the Lord led his people where they would be unmolested in their efforts to establish his work.\nTo bring the nations of the earth to a knowledge of the literal establishment of such a kingdom was, however, the purpose of God. In his wisdom, therefore, he prepared a place for his saints to gather where they might become strong, a place of refuge among the towering rocks and hidden valleys of the mountains. Here, as a peculiar people, they too must be prepared, that they live and obey his laws, which eventually all men, too, must obey if they would enjoy peace and the blessings of prosperity.\nPresident Brigham Young's first advice to the saints on that July 25, 1847, was concerning one of the laws of God?that of keeping the Sabbath day holy. Weakened as a result of an illness which had seized him just before the company of first pioneers entered the Valley, he expressed his wishes briefly. Elder Wilford Woodruff recorded his remarks as follows: \"He told the brethren that they must not work on Sunday; that they would lose five times as much as they would gain by it. None were to hunt on that day and there should not any man dwell among us who would not observe these rules. They might go and dwell where they pleased, but should not dwell with us\" (Josmer Paramos Saints without Halos in Church History, page 451).\nThese remarks and the spirit which prompted them were typical of the serious manner with which\nPage 624 LESSON DEPARTMENT 625 the followers of this Prophet regarded the literal acceptance of God's word. Within the period of the first ten years that followed the entrance of the saints into the promised land, they set to work with zeal bringing about the fulfillment of many of the great and beautiful prophecies of the seers of old. It was an eventful ten years from 1847 to 1857. Within this decade, hundreds of Mormons, from many nations of the earth, having left their homes, streamed into the Valley. There was hard work to be done if the desert was to blossom as the rose, and scouting expeditions to be sent throughout the vast mountain regions if the stakes of Zion were to be set and lengthened (Isa. 54:2). An actual ensign was to be raised upon the hills that all people who would hear might know that Zion was again, and that they could flow into it. Temples were to be erected, since God had said that his people were always commanded to build a holy house unto his name (Doc. And Gov. 124:39). The land of Deseret or the \"Honey Bee\" it would become, as the Book of Mormon term implied. Visioning the industry and zeal with which the latter-day work of Israel would be carried forth, Isaiah, the ancient prophet, wrote: And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolation and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations (Isaiah 61:4). And of the people and their abode, he said: He that walketh righteously, and speak-eth uprightiy; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands firom holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off. Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? Where is the receiver? Where is he that counted the towers? Thou shall not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand. Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities; thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby\" (Isaiah 33:15-21). The actual story of the events which now are history and which now outline the early acts performed in laying the foundations of an empire in the West are filled with the color of human endeavor, courage and self-sacrifice. Soil was broken on the 23rd and 24th of July, that the seed so carefully treasured during the journey west might find its early germination in the Valley. When Monday morning, July 26th, arrived, eager exploring parties set out, some to the west of the valley beyond the Western Jordan River. John Brown and Joseph Matthews were among this group. Others went east into the canyons to return with reports of good timber. Wil-ford Woodruff and a party turned north to discover warm springs, and the next day they went west again into the Tooele valley. It was Orson Pratt who, on the trip, climbed a mountain to view Utah Lake. All companies returned with the feeling  that their present site in the valley of the Great Salt Lake was the best place in which to lay out the city with its temple to the Lord. It was on the 26th also that a party, including President Brigham Young ascended what is now known as \"Ensign Peak\" to the north of Salt Lake. Here it was the desire of President Young to lift up an ensign to the nations spoken of by the Prophet Isaiah.\nBy the 28th, President Young had designated the site upon which the temple to the Lord would be built. He said: \"Here is the forty acres for the temple, and the city can be laid out perfectly square north and south, east and west.\"\nEvents throughout the rest of the summer months moved on smoothly. A fort was built on the square now known as Pioneer Park in Salt Lake City. This, it was felt, would serve as a protection against the Indians who by now were crowding around the saints to beg and steal. With the return of part of the Mormon Battalion, added strength was given to the colony. On October 3, 1847, a conference was held at which Elder John Smith, uncle of the Prophet Joseph Smith [and great-grandfather of President George Albert Smith], was sustained as the first president of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion. The year 1847 closed with a total of 2,095 souls in the Salt Lake Valley.\nOne of the most beautiful stories for the saints of the first years in the mountains is that of the crickets and the gulls. The feeding of Elijah by the ravens will ever be remembered to stir the love for birds and their courage to share when it is scarce, where in modern times can one turn for a more inspiring account of mercy from the skies than to that of the winged gulls from off the shores of Great Salt Lake.\nNo real crop was gathered by the saints for the season of 1847. The pioneers had arrived too late that year to expect much of a harvest. It was then to the spring and summer of 1848 that they must look for a yield if they were to live. The planting season for that year came, and, as the tender shoots pushed forth, the hopes for a bountiful harvest were high. May and June, however, brought not only the sunshine, but danger. Armies of marching crickets trooped down from the mountain sides to mow the fields. Trenches were dug, fires built, cattle and men called to tramp out the insects, but to no avail. Finally, in tearful supplication, the saints poured out their hearts to the Lord for deliverance. As they raised their eyes, what appeared to be a black cloud overhead shortly took shape in the form of hundreds of white-breasted gulls. At first, stricken by fear, lest these birds had come to finish what the crickets had left, the saints stolidly watched. But fear was not to be their lot, for, instead of feasting upon the crops, the birds hacked at the pests, and, gorging themselves, winged off to disgorge their feed. They returned again and again to repeat the attack until, with raucous cries, they wheeled into the air and vanished from sight. It was the miracle of the gulls these modern children of Israel had witnessed. Today, upon Temple Square in Salt Lake City, there stands the fine monument of its kind to a bird, and beneath its shaft is cast, in bronze, the story of the Utah seagull. LESSON DEPARTMENT 627 In other early accounts of this beginning empire in the West are recorded the stories of trips by President Brigham Young and others of the leading brethren back and forth across the plains to Winter Quarters. They were ever interested in bringing safely into the land of Zion the many souls who daily were embracing the gospel. It was on one of the trips back to Missouri that the apostles met and organized the First Presidency with Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards as the first three men to hold these offices in the presidency since the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hy-rum. About that time, too, Oliver Cowdery returned to the Church and again was baptized a member. In Zion, in the month of March 1849, the first political convention was called. The saints were desirous of having their territory under the flag of the United States. Then, in September of 1850, President Millard Fillmore appointed the first federal officers for the Territory of Utah with Brigham Young as governor. The years ahead were to be stormy since, in the main, weak officials who sought personal gains in office were sent to assume control over the saints in their new Territory. A most important event of these years came with the laying of the cornerstones of the temple on April 6, 1853. Each stone was laid with dedicatory prayers of thanksgiving. Among the significant thoughts expressed that day were these by President Brigham Young: We dedicate the south-east corner stone of the temple to the Most High God. May it remain in peace till it has done its work, and until He who has inspired our hearts to fulfil the prophecies of His holy prophets, that the house of the Lord should be reared in the \"tops of the Mountains\" shall be satisfied, and say it is enough. (Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, page 482). The prophecies of old are being fulfilled. * Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word.\" 1. In the month of December 1830 came the word of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith concerning the place of Zion. It reads, \"Keep all the commandments and covenants by which ye are bound; and I will cause the heavens to shake for your good, and Satan shall tremble and Zion shall rejoice upon the hills and flourish\" (Doc. And Gov. 35:24). Why were the hills to which the saints were to go so desirable a place for God's people? Bring in a map of the Rocky Mountain region centered about Utah. Find in some history text an account of the \"Land of the Northern Mystery\" (The Great Salt Lake Basin). See Howard R. Driggs, Westward America, page 16. Read Doc. And Gov. 38:13-22. Note especially verse 19. This revelation was given at the third general conference of the Church. 2. What may those expect who keep the commandments and inherit the land of Zion? Read and discuss the revelation given through Joseph, the Seer in Jackson Gounty, Missouri, August 7, 1831 (Doc. And Gov. 59). See Doc. And Cov. Commentary, pages 246-247. Footnote. Assign chapter 40, Essentials in Church History, for additional facts of interest concerning the first months in the Valley. Also see \"Utah's First July 24th Celebration,\" by Harold H. Jenson, Improvement Era, July 1942. Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 4-Charity Vaunteth Not Itself, Is Not Puffed Up Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, January 8, 1946 Objective: To show that true charity is self-forgetting. JESUS spoke this parable: Unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one, a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted\" (Luke 18:9-14). Jesus did not condemn the Pharisee because of his righteousness, because he was not an unjust person, an extortioner or an adulterer, nor because he paid tithes and fasted twice a week. These good deeds were all to his credit. His sin consisted in the self-righteous pleasure he took in his own goodness. It is only when we forget ourselves that we can be our best selves, that we can act in our full power and strength. Consciousness of self inhibits the free expression of oneself in any walk of life. A self-conscious speaker is ineffective. A beautiful girl loses much of her attractiveness if she acts conscious of it. Charity cannot both display and express itself at the same time. Charity means to love and to give. This, one cannot do with self-glorification or benefit in mind. That would be a contradiction. Jesus asked that we always act with singleness of purpose. He said not to give to be seen of men, but \"when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.\" He wanted us to give for the sake of giving. He asks us to love our fellow men freely, spontaneously, without fear of punishment or hope of reward. A friend relates this experience in giving: \"One Sunday afternoon I decided to visit a bed-ridden friend, thinking it would be a Christian way to spend the Sabbath and that I might render him a service. I found him in much pain, yet he talked cheerfully and not of himself. His suffering had tempered his spirit, developing in him humility and a deep compassion for others. I left his home profoundly moved and spiritually quickened, and I felt ashamed that I had thought of myself as they giver and of him as the receiver of my benevolence.? \"Charity vaunteth not itself, not puffed up?seeketh not her own.? The only check on our charity should be effectiveness in the lives of others. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 4?Bible Influence as Revealed in Our Narrative and Epic Poetry Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, January 22, 1946 CHAUCER, often called the father of English literature, gave us in his Canterbury Tales outstanding narrative poetry. In this group of stories, preserved vibrantly by a literary master, we have an artistic portrayal of England in the Middle Ages. With picturesque old English, which, well-voiced, brings a charm and flavor of its own, the poet tells of \"myrie and Niceity in a companie of sondry folk\" who are making a pilgrimage about Easter time to pay homage to a \"holy blissful martyr\" who has \"holpen hem (them) whan that they been seke (sick).\" To while time away on the long journey to and from Canterbury, the travelers relate favorite tales. These, like the different storytellers, mirror the spirit, the custom, the people of that \"olden tyme.\"\nNaturally, with such personages as a prioress, a nun, a monk, a pardoner, a friar, and a poor parson, in the company, we are brought closer to the religious thought and practices of the people, a keen observer, sketches these vivid characters in his prologue with artistry. He pictures the prioress as demure and neat and cultured. There are poetic shafts aimed at the monk who in this case was not pale and studious, but worldly and well fed. For show and sham and abuses of religion, the poet reveals little patience. His ire flames especially at the pardoner who went about selling indulgences, preying upon the poor and rich alike. For the poor parson, however, he has nothing but praise. \"Riche he was in holy thought and work,\" says the poet; and further:\nHe wayted after pomp and reverence, Ne (not) maked him a spiced conscience, But Cristes lore,\" and his gospels twelve, He taught, and first he folwed it him selve.\n\"Meaning the gospel of Christ.\nBecause of the old-time language, which, after all, is mainly what we use today, only with some letters spelled differently, many folk miss the enjoyment of Chaucer. For those who do get over the not very difficult word barrier, there are delightful descriptions, touches of humor, bits of wisdom and gospel truths, as well as charming stories in his writings. He pictures for us typically human folk of not only his own day, but of all time. Throughout the work of this pioneer in English narrative poetry, the helpful influence of the Bible is plainly shown. Another of our great poets who drew from the Bible not only inspiration but divine themes for his masterpieces was John Milton. In him, as in Chaucer, we can see three major influences blended to help bring forth masterly creations. First, the freedom-demanding spirit of the Anglo-Saxon; second, the culture of classic Greece; third, the Bible, with its teachings of God and the gospel of Jesus Christ. For a helpful comparison here, think of the soil-laden waters of the Missouri as typifying the rugged northland folk; the clearer Mississippi as the more artistic Hellenes; and the \"Beautiful Ohio\" as the spiritualizing Hebraic and Christian contribution? all flowing together to make one great stream. In Paradise Lost, to apply this analogy, we have an excellent example of such a blended creation. Milton was trained in Anglo-Saxon love of freedom; he was a classical scholar, a devoted student of the scriptures. As secretary of Oliver Cromwell, he naturally was stirred to the depths by the arrogant assumption of King Charles the First, that kings had \"divine right\" to rule. To the poet this all had its prototype in the \"War in Heaven\" with Satan, father of tyrants, fighting to dominate the souls of men, and Christ leading the host battling to uphold man's right to exercise his God-given free agency. Here was a Bible-inspired theme, vital then and always. How could it be most splendidly expressed? All the artistry of poetry Milton had gained from his classic studies was brought into play. Paradise Lost most sublime of epics, vibrates with the spirit of liberty; it is stately in form, portraying heavenly characters, Satan and his legions in hell, the Son of God and his divine mission, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, their temptation by the Devil, their fall, and expulsion from Paradise. Ringing lines of truth, precious descriptions, vivid moving pictures, all in the spirit of Job and Isaiah and the Apocalypse of John, bring this epic up to the world's greatest of literary creations. To feel its spiritual powers, its music and beauty, one must hear it effectively voiced. Further, it must be read and reread if the inner meaning of the poem is to be appreciated. Paradise Lost will yield its rare wealth only to those who are willing to pay the price of earnest study. Such effort, like that applied to the mastery of classic music, brings its rich and lasting rewards. Just a few lines can be given here to suggest some of the gems of thought and description within the great epic: Him (Satan) th' Almighty Power Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky. The mind is its own place, and in itself Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven?-so says the fallen Satan. LESSON DEPARTMENT When the Son of God offers himself to redeem the world, his Father, with tender love and admiration, makes promise that through this atoning sacrifice shall come, in time, New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. And after all their tribulations long. See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds. With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. Matchless portrayal of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, of the subtleties of Satan, and of the driving of our first parents from Paradise, carry forward the great story to its closing lines: Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon; The world was all before them, where to choose Their place of rest, and Providence their guide. They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, Through Eden took their solitary way. The Canterbury Tales and Paradise Lost differ basically in form. Stories that Chaucer brings together in the first are individual, unrelated tales. It is only the outward plan, devised by the poet, of having the various pilgrims traveling together tell the different stories that holds them with something of unity. Paradise Lost, on the other hand, is made up of different stories, each of which helps to develop the central theme. This makes it an epic, similar to the Illiad, the Odyssey or to Hiawatha. The Canterbury Tales, in structure may be likened to a necklace; Paradise Lost is more wheel-like in its story unity. Idylls of the King by Tennyson is another great epic. Its various interesting stories of the Knights of the Round Table center in Arthur, their king. In Celtic tales this legendary hero was preserved through the years. In Mallory's Morte d'Arthur, one of the first of English books to be printed, stories linked with Arthur's name are in prose. Tennyson brings to us many of the same stories in more polished English blank (unrhymed) verse. Further, the poet portrays King Arthur more plainly as a champion of Christianity. With his chosen and tested knights, he strives to hold back the Anglo-Saxon pagans who, when the Roman legions were withdrawn from England, made conquest of that realm. With \"We fight for our fair father Christ,\" as something of a battle cry, the courageous Arthur: Fought, and in twelve great battles overcame The heathen hordes, and made a realm and reigned. At the outset the King had announced: \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new.\" Something more, however, than victory over pagan hosts was necessary to make good that vow. Stories, one after another, of the Knights of the Table Round, reveal the continuing struggle against sin, disloyalty to high ideals, and a falling from grace. Then into the epic comes the miracle of the Holy Grail. This sacred symbol, one legend has it, was the cup out of which Christ drank at his Last Supper. Taken to England, so the old story goes, by Joseph of Arimathea, it had remained there until the time-Grew such evil that the holy cup Was caught away to heaven and disappeared. Only by the absolutely pure could the cup again be seen. A sister of Sir Percival, of the Table Round, was first to win that precious privilege. 632 Said she: Sweet brother, I have seen the Holy Grail: For waked at dead of night, I heard a sound As of a silver horn from o'er the hills... And then Streamed through my cell a cold and silver beam. And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail. Rose red \"with beatings on it, as if alive... And then the music faded, and the Grail Pass'd.... So now the Holy Thing is here again Among us, brother, fast thou too and pray, And tell thy brother knights to fast and pray, That so perchance the vision may be seen By thee and those and all the world be heal'd. Percival, heeding his sister's words, withdrew from the Table Round to an abbey, to pass his life thenceforth in prayer and fast and alms. Other knights, catching the religious fervor, likewise took up the quest of the Holy Grail. Among them was Galahad, youngest of all. To this splendid youth, King Arthur, dubbing him knight, had said, \"God make thee as pure as thou art beautiful.\" That tiie prayer was granted is attested by the story that Galahad was one who did see the vision of the Holy Grail. But unrighteousness did not cease. The Table Round in time was broken up. At last came the passing of the king (Morte d'Ar-thur).And, as the great leader neared the close of his uplifting life, he said again: The old order changeth, yielding place to new?Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of Outstanding among our American creators of narrative and epic poetry is Longfellow. His name, to most folk, will bring memories of Evangeline and The Courtship oi Miles Standish. Something deeper than just interesting stories are in these and other narrative verse by Longfellow. Evangeline is a symphony impressing \"the beauty and strength of woman's devotion\"; The Courtship oi Miles Standish likewise is a musically beautiful poem portraying conflict between love and duty. Both picture with artistry moving scenes in earlier American life: one a story of the Norman peasantry transplanted to Arcadia; the other a story of the Pilgrims in Plymouth. To get the full richness out of these classics, one must read and reread them and, in doing so, follow Longfellow's own advice from \"The Day is Done\": Lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty of thy voice. All great poetry was created to be heard rather than just to be read silently. Another thing: to appreciate the inner meaning and spiritual beauty of these story-poems one must know the Bible. All through them are lines that call, as do the following, for a working knowledge of that Book of Books. These are typical ones from Evangeline: Harvests were gathered in; and wild, with the winds of September Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel. Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's Desolate seashore. Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock with the self-same Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter. Hot and on his lips still burned the flush of the fever As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had besprinkled its portals. LESSON DEPARTMENT 633 That the angel of death might see the sign and pass over. And these from The Courtship of Miles Standish: This is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger, For I have followed too much the heart's desires and devices, Worshipping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal. This is the cross I must bear, the sin and the swift retribution. Giants in hearts they were, who believed in God and the Bible, Ay, who believed in the smiting of Midianites and Philistines. Forth from the curtain of clouds, from the tent of purple and scarlet. Issued the sun, the great High Priest, in his garments resplendent. Holiness unto the Lord, in letters of light on his forehead. Another of Longfellow's creations, in structure like that of the Canterbury Tales and doubtless inspired by Chaucer's creation, is Tales of A Wayside Inn. In his later years, the American poet, as professor of the chair of poetry at Harvard, gathered round him friends and students from not only his own but other countries. Go to the Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts? preserved now as a shrine by Henry Ford, in tribute to Longfellow's work which gave the place literary immortality?and you may see photographs of some of these friends hanging on the wall. There, as the poet devised the setting for his tales, the group of friends would gather round the fireside, and share their stories. From the genial landlord, they were given the first one, \"Paul Revere's Ride.\" Another, \"King Robert of Sicily\" came from a Sicilian; still another, already mentioned in the first of our lessons \"The Saga of King Olaf\" was related by the musician, Ole Bull. A Spanish Jew, a poet, a theologian, and a student, all add their favorite tales. And these, with prelude and interludes, are held together as with a strand?story gems made into a literary necklace. Many of the stories are closely linked with the Bible. This is true especially of \"King Robert of Sicily,\" \"The Legend Beautiful,\" and the \"Legend of Rabbi Ben Levi.\" Others, like \"The Birds of Killingworth\" vibrate with the Christian spirit. And this may be said not only of Longfellow's poems as a whole, but of story-poems created by Whittier, Lowell, and other fine American poets. Space forbids more than this passing tribute due these creators of interesting, uplifting literature. Discussion and Activities 1. (a) What, in brief, does Chaucer portray in The Canterbury Tales?

Christensen For Tuesday, January 29, 1946 Lesson link: Drug addiction, alcoholism, gambling, unchastity, and other moral problems of personal conduct were analyzed last time. Causes and consequences in each of these areas of defiant behavior were emphasized, and it was shown that the effects of private immorality reach much farther than the offending persons themselves. Repentance was given as the way out. Lesson aim: To demonstrate a relationship between modes of recreation and morality, and to suggest ways for improving the morals of society by making better use of leisure time. MAN has not always enjoyed the leisure that he knows today. There was a time, not so long ago, when recreational activities were largely reserved for the privileged upper classes, and the common man was required to toil from dawn until dusk. But all of this has now been changed. No longer is there a special leisure class monopolizing both idleness and opportunity; instead, today, every class is a leisure class. In a remarkably short period of time the machine age has cut the working day in half, releasing, thereby, many surplus man hours for leisure-time activities. And the end is not yet. It is not at all improbable that technological progress in the future will reduce the working day to four or five hours, thus assuring the average man a large amount of leisure time.\nBut time is a responsibility as well as an opportunity, and, where improperly used, may prove to be a liability rather than an asset. Most people who get into trouble seem to do so in their spare time. The statement, \"Idleness is the devil's workshop,\" is as true today as when it was first uttered, and yet there is more time for idleness now than ever before. Personal debaucheries, such as those discussed in the previous lesson, are in many cases the direct result of the dissipation of leisure time.\nRecreation for Profit\nLiterally the term recreation means to revive, refresh or create anew; in other words, to \"re-create.\" Actually, judging by the dissipation and immorality frequently carried on under its name, it could sometimes better be spelled \"wreckreation\" with emphasis on the \"wreck.\" Leisure time is potentially a blessing, giving opportunity for rest, hobby activities, sports, social life, cultural developments, and artistic expressions; but it is often wasted or used unwisely, wrecking both health and character, and leaving misery in its wake.\nThe major reason for this perversion of leisure-time opportunity is the profit motive. Business interests, seeing the great increase of leisure that has taken place in the modern world, have capitalized upon the situation for the sake of private profit. It used to be that practically all recreational activities were in the home or other primary groups, were largely spontaneous, and were free. Now, however, there is an all-too-common feeling that to have any fun one must go out of the home and spend money for recreation. When the desire for profit comes in conflict with the welfare of the public it usually suffers, which explains the reason for so much of the corrupt in our leisure-time activities. With a few exceptions, commercialized recreation is concerned with profit rather than morals, and it is this disregard for the best interests of the public that accounts for so many of its lurid appeals and unfortunate influences.\nThen, too, commercialized recreation is so often of the passive variety that, aside from any directly unwholesome influence it may have, it fails to restore or revive, and it may even actually fatigue or destroy the personality. We are too frequently spectators and too infrequently participants in leisure-time activities to get the most out of them. It is better to be an active player than a passive watcher or listener; to be really effective, recreation must be active and creative.\nAnother unfortunate tendency accompanying the profit motive in commercialized recreation is the development and acceptance of the \"thrill\" psychology. Thrills and super-thrills seem to characterize the spirit of the times. The real danger in this, of course, lies in the fact that continual thrills of the physical and sensuous type tend to blunt the finer sensitivities of man, blinding him to the deeper spiritual joys of life, and causing him to feel that he must not stop until he has tried everything. And, in such a frame of mind, when the \"giant racer\" variety of thrill no longer satisfies, he will sometimes seek for bigger thrills in robbery, sex crimes, etc.\nThe Picture Show\nIt has been estimated that at least one hundred million people attend Here is the OCR-corrected transcription of the excerpt:\nthe movies each week in this country, and that about twenty-eight million of these are minors. Since the picture show has such a widespread appeal as this, it might be well to inquire into its possible influence upon moral behavior.\nThere have been a number of studies dealing with the relationship between movie attendance and moral conduct, and they all point to the same general conclusion; namely, that movies are frequently a stimulus to delinquent conduct, particularly with youth.\nThe picture show is able to effectively dramatize and glamorize different modes of life to make them appealing. As a result, Hollywood sets the styles in mannerisms and morals as well as in clothes. Children and adolescents, because of their immaturity, are especially impressionable and susceptible to influence. In pictures dealing with crime the bad man usually gets caught, it is true, and the implication is usually left that \"crime does not pay\"; but to the adolescent the criminal's glamorous life is often more vivid and thrilling than is the somewhat dry fact that he pays in the end. Love and sex themes frequently arouse the romantic and sexual emotions and condition the attitudes of youngsters, with sexual experimentation and promiscuity as the result. Many a juvenile delinquent, and no few number of adults, have testified that they got their start in crime from the movies.\nAll of this raises the question of control, and there are essentially three points at which control might take place; (1) In production centers. The Will Hays office of censorship in Hollywood is successful in eliminating many of the objectionable features of each play, but it needs to go farther. The Catholic Legion of Decency, and other similar pressure groups, though smaller, have succeeded in wielding some desirable influence on movie producers, but they are too limited in their scope and power. There is need for a united movement on the part of all the public to demand that better shows be produced. (2) In the community. Some states and a few local communities have censorship laws to control the type of shows allowed to come in, but in most places the market is open to anything that will bring profit to the company regardless of whether it is good or bad from the standpoint of the community. Citizens need to develop a community consciousness to the extent that they will tolerate only the better pictures to be shown. (3) In the home. Fortunately, no one is compelled to see a movie just because it is shown in the community. But there are too many families that seemingly don't care where their members spend their time; too many parents who are indifferent to their children's absence or who may even send them to a show (without first informing themselves as to the kind of show) in order to get them out of the way. Movies of the right sort can be valuable aids in character building, but there are too many of the wrong sort and too many parents who either don't know or don't care. Of such is immorality bred.\nThe Public Dance Hall\nDancing itself is innocent enough, but the conditions and temptations surrounding the average public dance hall of the day are enough to\nmake of it a real moral problem. LESSON DEPARTMENT 637 Men and women of all ages come together without chaperonage and usually in search of a thrill. Many are unescorted. The hardened and depraved rub elbows with the innocent and adventurous. Lights are dimmed. The orchestra plays softly and romantically. Liquor is brought and passed around. ?Pickups\" are made for the rendezvous after the dance. Regrets and despair too often await the dawn. Some may think that this picture of the public dance hall is painted overly dark; but if it is, it is only for the sake of emphasis. All that is said here is true, and while it must be recognized that many can attend the public dance and remain unharmed, yet it must also be admitted that many others cannot; and therein lies the danger. If liquor, unescorted attendance, and pickups could be eliminated from the public dance hall, it would be far more acceptable from the moral point of view. Parents and community workers should insist upon these reforms, but in the meantime they should strive to keep their children free from all such dangerous, immoral exposures. Miscellaneous Decreative Patterns Although the picture show and the public dance were singled out for special analysis, it should be remembered that there are a great many other patterns of \"recreation-al\" behavior that are decreative or demoralizing in their results. And some of these are even more destructive than the two mentioned above. Thriller radio programs, comics, and pulp magazines all join with the movies in furnishing morbid and distorted stimulation to the young. It might be just about as logical to speak of \"our radio-made children\" or \"our comic-made children\" as it is to speak of \"our movie-made children,\" for in each case the effect of continuous exposure upon attitudes and behavior is rather profound. Overstimulation and overexcitement with emphasis upon the brutal and the gruesome is characteristic of a proportion of them all. It is even difficult to understand why the so-called comic magazines are spoken of as comics at all. As for the dime novel and the pulp magazine, the slant is so definitely toward sex, erotic love, and cheap adventure as to be revolting to all mature persons. But youth are not mature, and to permit them to be exposed to some of this vicious literature is a moral crime of considerable magnitude. The night club, the cabaret, the roadhouse, the pool hall, the \"beer joint,\" the gambling den, the taxi dance hall, and the burlesque or \"girl\" show, are a few other types of leisure-time activities that frequently lead to extreme personal and social disorganization. Alcohol and sex used for profit, either singly or together, create very dangerous situations, regardless of the name of the institution used as a shield. Often, too, the problem is primarily one of sheer idleness, starting in boredom and ending in mischief. Personal disorganization resulting from the misuse of leisure time is not restricted to the big city with its high-powered temptations and its opportunities for anonymity. The small town is frequently just as much to blame, and this for the very reason that it fails to provide wholesome and challenging activities and interests. But, whatever the community, idleness when permitted to exist creates real moral problems. Loitering on the streets, \"killing time\" in the pool halls, and seeking thrills in the back alleys, all start with idleness and end with trouble. Leisure Time and the Community The blessing of abundant leisure time, which has come to man and which will increase all the more in the future, carries with it a great moral responsibility. That responsibility is to use this extra time well, to let it be the means of lifting man up to the better and nobler things of life. When dissipated, leisure time leads to both idleness and debauchery, examples of which we have seen throughout this lesson. When utilized in line with moral principles, it leads to richer experiences, deeper appreciations, and loftier satisfactions. Our job is to eliminate the waste and the wreckage of leisure, and to put in their place the finer and more wholesome things of life. Students of crime and delinquency frequently point to the lack of adequate cultural and recreational facilities in the community as a major factor in immoral and anti-social conduct. This is especially true with reference to the young. With time on their hands and the desire for fun, young people often find themselves faced with the limited alternatives of loitering on the streets or participating in some relatively unwholesome commercialized, leisure-time offering. No wonder so many of them get into trouble. It is high time that more of our communities awaken to the problem, as some are now doing, and provide decent places and programs for the enjoyment and development of the young during their leisure hours. Recreational centers should be developed, appealing cultural programs should be offered, ct cetera. Schools, churches, service clubs, and other groups can give valuable assistance to such a movement by talking it up, offering their facilities for the various activities, and by manifesting their willingness to co-operate in the larger, integrated community program. There is much that can be done on a community basis to check delinquency and develop morality in the young. Latent resources that could be utilized to combat these evil influences are abundant in every community. But to accomplish this, as it should be accomplished, will require the interest and united effort of all. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Explain how the great increase of leisure time has been possible. Why does leisure time, sometimes prove to be a liability rather than an asset? Give examples. Do you agree that most people who get into trouble do so in their spare time? Explain. 2. How does the profit motive lead to corruption in recreational activities? Give examples. Why has the increase in commercialized recreation paralleled the increase in leisure time? Is commercialized recreation always \"wreckreation?\" Defend your point of view. What is spectatoritis? Is it good or bad? Discuss. 3. Why are picture shows so influential in the shaping of attitudes and conduct? Show how movies have contributed to delinquency (as a basis for this the class leader may want to have someone give a brief review of Forman's Our LESSON DEPARTMENT 639 Movie Made Children). Select one or two recent picture shows that most of the class would have seen and criticize as to good and bad features. How can the quality of pictures produced and coming into the community be controlled? What is the particular responsibility of parents regarding movie attendance? Suggest ways and means of selecting the better pictures and of directing the attendance of children. Describe the major evils attending the average public dance hall, and explain why each is an evil. Is dancing itself an evil? Why not? Can you suggest any ways of eliminating the evils of the dance without eliminating dancing itself? Show how certain radio programs, comics, and magazine materials are unwholesome. If possible, ask class members ahead of time to listen to certain radio programs for children. Criticize these programs in class. Bring selected comics and pulp magazines to class as a basis for discussion. Describe other disorganizing leisure-time activities that may be in your community. 6. Why does leisure time. Carry with it a moral responsibility? Discuss ways that your community might organize for a better use of leisure time, and show how individuals and groups can help. Could the Relief Society do anything about this problem? Discuss. 7. Why is the Family Hour program, recommended by the Church, so influential in shaping attitudes and conduct?

Set with gaily colored pottery, such a table presents an invitation to enjoyment which stimulates the day's activities. 'INHERE is never a meal where floral decorations are out of place, never a buifet supper nor a children's party that is not made more attractive by artistic flower arrangements. These decorative centerpieces should be simple, composed of clear, bright colors, entirely cheerful in effect. Nasturtiums, intermixed with their crisp green leaves, are appetite-inspiring flowers. The simplest arrangement is suitable for the informal luncheon. A few sprays of asters or cosmos, if placed in an appropriate container, will make a FLOWERS AND FRUIT FOR THE TABLE 611 lovely centerpiece for this meal. Calendulas and marigolds reflect the warmth and brilliance of the autumn season. The ingenuity of the mother-hostess is put to the test in the choice of flowers which may be available in the family garden plot. Charming center decorations may be made by placing one or two dahlias or chrysanthemums in a shallow dish filled with water. Pansies, also, provide an attractive center of interest by cutting the stems and letting the petals float on the water. Petunias, in their gay multicolors, are a delight, and they adapt themselves to almost any type of container. Autumn is particularly lavish in its gifts of color and beauty. Grains of all kinds, in their golden splendor, offer endless opportunities for attractive table decorations. Feathery oats, in gleaming yellow, against a blue bowl make a picture not soon forgotten. Weed stems, red berries, colored leaves, are gifts from autumn ?gifts that we may bring inside our homes. Fruit arrangements are at all times appealing. Luscious grapes are irresistibly tempting, especially in clusters of green and purple which can be draped gracefully over the edge of a bowl. Mixed fruits, such as oranges, bananas, apples, pears, and peaches do not lack in decorative appeal. Fruits of contrasting form should be selected for combinations. There should usually be a preponderance of one kind of fruit, with color and line accents of other kinds. Whatever type of centerpiece is selected, the arrangement should never be high enough to obstruct the view across the table. DINING TABLE WITH FRUIT CENTERPIECE Picture taken at Lion House, Salt Lake City. Dining room decoration by Mary Grant Judd Also, it should not be so flat that it does not display itself to advantage. If the table is long, several small arrangements may be more effective than a single elaborate centerpiece.\nCandles for the dinner table provide a festive touch, but they should be used only in the evening when artificial light is required. For intimate occasions the light from the fireplace may be sufficient for the evening meal.\nWhile individual ingenuity must be depended upon for variety and results, there are certain basic rules for table setting. The linen, china, and silver required will depend upon the meal and the menu. However, the placing of the napkins, silver, china, and glassware is the same for all occasions. The napkin is folded simply?large napkins with the monogram up, and smaller napkins with the long side toward the plate.\nSilver is placed on the table at the beginning of a meal only for the courses which are served before the tines up, and all knives and spoons to the right of the individual setting. They should be laid at right angles to the edge of the table, about an inch from the edge. The blades of the knives should be turned toward the plate. Each piece of silver should be laid in the order in which it is to be used, from the outside in. If more silver is required it should be placed upon the table immediately before the course for which it will be used. The tumbler or goblet for water should be placed an inch above and slightly to the right of the largest knife. Butter plates should be placed to the left and above the forks, with the butter knife lying across the rim of the butter plate.\nPleasure may be found in doing anything well. The three times daily task of table setting may be made pleasant and adventurous by using materials readily available for bringing beauty to the table. Let us serve our families with thoughtfulness and artistic planning."

            "content": "Prayer Elder Mark E. Petersen Member Council of the Twelve FOUR little girls of Bee-Hive age spent a week together last summer in an M.I.A. sponsored home in a nearby canyon. On arriving at the home, they were assigned to a sleeping room large enough to accommodate all four of them. With joyous anticipation they unpacked their things and prepared for a week of genuine vacation.\nThat first night before retiring, one of the girls brought up the subject of saying evening prayers. What were the girls to do about it? Should each one say her own secret prayer? Should they all pray as a group? Or should they do both?\nIt required little time for solution of the question because all of these girls came from praying homes. They decided that each night and morning they would kneel together as a group, each one taking a turn in being voice. In addition, each girl would have her own secret prayers. That was the custom at home. So the girls prayed together, and they had agreed separately, not allowing even a vacation to interfere with their devotions.\nIs there a father or a mother anywhere, who would not be proud of little girls who were thus true to the faith? And is there a ward or a stake which would not be proud of parents who thus teach their little ones to pray?\nA marine fighting on a Pacific Island was commanded to take his men through heavy fire into an extremely dangerous position to destroy Japanese emplacements. Before going, he and some of his men knelt in prayer. He wrote home:\nAs we started from the protection of our foxhole, a strange thing happened. All enemy fire lifted. We completed our mission. We then returned to our foxholes. We had no more than got well down in them when enemy fire opened up again, but we were safe and sound. We were praying and thanking our Heavenly Father for so openly answering our prayers and protecting our lives. How great are the blessings shed out upon those who diligently seek his help.\nWhen boys and girls pray as did these young people, there is a reason for it. They had been taught to pray, even from infancy. But while they were thus being taught they learned something else as well to have faith in God, and to exercise that faith in bringing down upon themselves the blessings of heaven.\nWhere were they taught this faith, and where did they learn to pray? In their homes with their families, as father, mother, and children knelt together night and morning expressing their gratitude to the Lord for blessings already received, and asking for his continued help and guidance, protection and care, in the days and nights to come.\nPage  Latter-day Saints recognize that as a people and as individuals, we have one principal purpose in life, and that is to work out our salvation here on the earth and to teach our children and others who will listen to us to do likewise. We work out our salvation by keeping the commandments\" of the Lord, by participating in the program of the Church, by following and sustaining those who preside over us, and by being loyal and true to the trust that is placed in us by our Heavenly Father. FAMILY prayer provides one of the most important means of accomplishing this great purpose. Let us first look at family prayer from the standpoint of the children in the home. As parents we have been commanded to teach the gospel to our children, to convert them to its principles, and to rear them in its light, habituating them to the mode of life advised by the Church. Our children need teaching and converting just as much as do those to whom we preach in the mission field. They do not bring with them into this life a knowledge of the gospel. They must acquire it here. President Grant at one time illustrated this point by saying that both he and his wife had a good working knowledge of the multiplication tables at the time they were married, but this gave them no assurance that their children would be born with a knowledge of the multiplication tables. The children had to be taught those tables, and how to use them. He said the same thing holds true with regard to a knowledge of the gospel. Children are not born with any such knowledge; they must acquire it here in mortality. There is no place where the gospel can be presented more effectively to children than in the home, and no persons are more interested in having it thus presented than are the parents. Family prayer can form the basis for the religious education of our children if we choose to make it so. Through family prayer, little children can learn of the existence of God. They can learn that by praying to the Lord, they can obtain the blessings they need. Through family prayer and associated instruction in the home, we may point out to our little ones that obedience to the Lord is an essential part of seeking blessings from him, and that if we believe in him, and obey his commandments, we are in a favorable position to pray for and receive the blessings we need. Through family prayer we may teach our children gratitude, that all good things come from God, and that we owe him our thanks for these blessings. Many there are who have never learned to pray, but we can teach our little ones how to pray as we hold our regular family prayers. They see and hear us pray, and when their turn comes, and they take active part, they learn to do by doing, and as they continue on they establish prayer as a daily habit in their lives. One of the most important features of family prayer from the standpoint of the children is that to which Jesus referred during his brief ministry among the Nephites. Said he: Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him... Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed (3 Ne-phi 18:15-21). With the multiplicity of temptations that confronts our children today, it is a great source of consolation and comfort to know that we are united in spirit and that family prayer fortifies us and our little ones against Satan. \"Pray always,\" said the Savior, \"LEST YE ENTER INTO TEMPTATION, for Satan desireth to have you that he may sift you as wheat.\" This one thing alone should bring every family to its knees in humble prayer day by day. Can any family afford to be without it?\nThere are many other factors of importance in family prayer many other blessings to be obtained through its proper observance.\nIf a family prays together regularly and humbly, those family prayers will go far to preserve mutual love and good will among the members of that family. Can a husband and a wife kneel together and unitedly appeal to the throne of grace, having their hearts melted by the spirit which accompanies fervent prayer, and not be drawn closer together, in case of domestic trouble in the home? Can they fail to solve their problems amicably if they will be humble themselves in prayer before each other and before the Lord, and pray together for mutual understanding? Can misunderstandings between parents and children continue under the sweet influence of sincere family prayer? The spirit of prayer is the spirit of peace, the spirit of good will, the spirit of charity and mercy. It is the spirit of love which is the spirit of God.\nFAMILY prayers help to keep the family in remembrance of its obligations to and covenants with the Lord. We, as Latter-day Saints, are pledged to \"always remember him\" that we may always have his spirit to be with us. Families who remember these obligations will not be disobedient to the commandments. They will not be found among the numerous waves of the world; they will not be listed among the Sabbath-breakers, nor among those who violate the Word of Wisdom or the law of chastity. They will not be teaching their children disobedience by holding before them an example of disobedience. Rather, they will be among the stalwarts of the Church, upholding the program of the Church, keeping the commandments and working constantly in the work or stakes.\nFamily prayer brings into the home the spirit of prayer, and any family which is actuated by the spirit of prayer is actuated by the spirit of God. Persons who leave a house of prayer each morning should carry with them an attitude of good will and fair play, of doing unto others as they would be done by; of righteousness, having a distaste for evil. In that way they may come to understand the meaning in the Savior's words: \"Pray always lest ye enter into temptation.\"\nWhere family prayers are held in sincerity and humility, the hearts of the members of those families are moved by a desire to be in harmony with the Lord and his servants. Where such a spirit prevails, there is no criticism of the bishop or the stake president, and there is no denunciation of the general authorities, for such criticism is out of harmony with the spirit of prayer. When persons refrain from criticism of the brethren, they resist one of the\napostate tendencies against which the Prophet Joseph has warned us.\nWhere family prayers are held with devotion, the home is not given over to activities which are opposed to the spirit of prayer. There is no drinking or smoking there, no vile stories, no unchanneled dealings, no lying nor backbiting, nothing unseemly. On the contrary, the home functions are conducted on a high plane where the habits of life are clean. Have you considered what this is worth in the rearing of a family?\nIt is the desire of the Church to see character built into the souls of\nfull of faith, devotion, and integrity. Sincere family prayer will help tremendously to bring this about. Can we neglect so great an opportunity?\nIf we as a people will hold family prayer in our homes with regularity, with faith and humility, and then establish habits of life in keeping with our prayers, the windows of heaven will be opened and such blessings will be poured out upon us that we can hardly contain them. Many of the problems which now vex us will fade away, life will be sweet indeed, and not only will we ourselves be benefited, but we will be as a light upon a hill, a beacon to all mankind. PRAYER Edwin C. Bliss To some, a prayer is mere routine, A boresome obligation. Prosaic offering of thanks. And unfelt adoration. Such praises, sung by grudging lips. Can never reach the throne; For God cares not for prayers made up Of words and words alone. A prayer must be a consecration, Heartfelt and sincere; A faith that, though the load be heavy, God is ever near; A willingness to work and wait As through the years we plod. And place our life entirely Within the hands of God."

            "content": "Shall I Be an Active Member of Relief Society? A Question Which is Vital to Every Woman in the Church Kate M. Barker Former Member Relief Society General Board \nAT the dedication of the science hall on the campus of one of our large universities, a student guide explained to the group he was conducting, \"In this room the tables for these sensitive instruments are stone pillars built on solid rock. If we are to get accurate readings it is necessary to have a foundation that goes down below the vibrations, shocks, and jars of the earth's surface.\"\nWhen the news came of the restoration of peace to the world, we received it with humble, prayerful thanksgiving. For five long years we had prayed for this moment, hoping that if the opportunity were given us again we would build a better world. The war has been a major spiritual shock. For five years we have seen the result of the greed, false pride, and selfishness that was the war's antecedents. Every day the press and the radio have brought us graphic accounts of man's \"inhumanity to man.\" So shocking have been the devastating events of the past years, that evil has seemed to far overshow good and we have become almost fearful of life.\nAt the same time that peace came we realized we were facing a new age a stupendous new age, the fruits of which, when the reactionary forces will be harnessed for man's\ndestruction or blessing. When the voice of the President of the United States came over the radio announcing the dropping of the atomic bomb with its resulting terrible devastation and loss of life, the first universal reaction was one of fear. \"It is a harnessing of the basic powers of the universe,\" came the voice of the President, and we stood awestruck, fearful. Verily \"men's hearts failed them.\"\n\"Can truth and goodness triumph?\" we ask. \"What does the future hold for our children?\"\nAs in the case of the delicate scientific instruments, in times like these man's spiritual nature must be anchored on solid rock. Unless the foundations of our faith are so anchored, the contemporary shocks of world affairs will find us confused and fearful; and our reading of life's scales will be only surface readings and not accurate readings.\nThe challenging words of our Savior to his disciples can be applied to us. \"Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?\" And the comforting words, \"And this word, Yet once more ... signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken ... that those things which cannot be shaken may remain\" (Heb. 12:27).\nOur faith, then, assures us that now after the world hurricane has\npassed, we shall find that the things of real value have survived. Beauty will remain beauty in earth and sea and sky; beauty in art, music, literature; beauty in character, in life. Truth also will remain. Goodness will survive. God still lives and will guide our destinies if we but let him and are willing to cooperate. We have lost some of our worldly assets, but the real values will carry through. They will survive for all to choose who will.\nSo the present, instead of making us despondent, should be a"

            "content": "challenge. Surely we are thanking our Heavenly Father today more gratefully than ever for the gospel and for his Church. Surely now more than ever our testimonies seem priceless, and we are resolved that their foundations must go deeper and deeper until \"surface shocks\" of life cannot weaken them. Now we know that the thing we desire above all else for our children is a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, a testimony so strong that it will be the motivating force always in their lives, a testimony and faith anchored so deeply and solidly that it will stand against all life's storms.\nThe use to which these tremendous forces which have been harnessed will be put, will depend on us. It will take intelligence. Such an age as we are facing demands strong people, a people who have faith in God, in mankind, and in man's destiny. We realize that the world is going to be filled with confusion, problems, and great demands.\nNo generation of women has ever faced greater responsibility. The home must be the nucleus for the better world; and the home cannot\nbe protected by merely negative ethics you must not do this, you must not do that. We must build a more definite, constructive faith in the basic, eternal, guiding principles of life. We must know as never before the divine plans for our happiness and welfare. Surely, the women of the Church, having faced the horrors of the war years, are resolved that henceforth their homes shall be built on the solid foundation of faith and, having seen the world suffering from so much that is false and ugly, are resolved that, insofar as they are able to control, only truth shall enter the home such truth as gives beauty to life and dignity to mankind and to human relationships.\nWOMAN has a great responsibility in setting standards and maintaining the spiritual and cultural level of the home and community. Our Father in heaven, knowing our needs to meet this responsibility, has been kind to the women of the Church. He has given them an organization of their own in which they can seek all those things that are \"virtuous, lovely, and of good report\" as the Prophet said, \"according to their natures.\" We do not learn best by ourselves added understanding, added appreciation comes with contact with the ideas and experiences of others.\nThe knowledge most worthwhile is certainly an understanding of the greatest needs of the beauty in the gospel, which is God's plan for our happiness. We could study all the greatest literature and no doubt never new beauty would unfold. As our knowledge and testimony increase, life takes on new meaning and beauty.\nOur Relief Society gives us the opportunity of a course of study that has been prayerfully planned and as broad as life itself spiritual, cultural, practical. We can be sure that only truth is contained therein, that everything given is worthwhile. Facts alone may be cold, but when interpreted in the light of the gospel, they take on glorious meanings. Our Relief Society teaching is done in \"the light of the gospel.\"\nToday, we must seek our happiness in a world where experiences, in a variety of ways, are continually attacking our faith and menacing our homes and our chances for a satisfying life. The modern tempo is characterized by an acid type of cynicism which does not believe that anything in the world is worthy of our serious allegiance. When people feel this way, not only marriage ties but all human relationships lose value, and life loses its sense of direction. And yet in every human soul is a longing for loyalty to something outside ourselves. The dictators have capitalized on this innate longing in their appeal to the young. \"Cynicism is defeatism applied to ideals.\" We can best be protected from it by the atmosphere of a loyal group working together for worthy ends.\nSo, active membership, loyalty to the Church is the finest safeguard against this defeatism, and all the resultant things that are cheap and shallow. The lack of intense loyalties to worthy causes is one of the great spiritual losses of modern times. Most parents desire greatly that their children belong to and feel a loyalty to their Church organization; yet, sometimes to us, we that the things they say and do, the\nloyalties they show, forge themselves into a pattern for their children, and children are influenced most by those whom they love most.\nMoreover, seeing is believing. We of the older generation whose parents or grandparents sacrificed so much to be true to the Church, have a background whose influence can seldom be entirely lost. We may become inactive and apparently indifferent for awhile, and then in later life repent. But what about our children who have seen only our disloyalties? President George Albert Smith, in a recent talk in Bonneville Stake, told the story of the son of one of our brethren who drifted away from all Church activity. In later life he realized what he was missing and returned to the Church, but found that his interest in the Church or its ideals could be aroused in his children. As President Smith said, \"He could repent but he could not repent for his children.\" In the fine lives of our children is our greatest joy, and in their failure is our greatest sorrow, especially when we realize that some fault of our own has contributed to that failure.\nWe can be no greater than our loyalties. The women of the Church have a divinely organized, divinely guided organization which is deserving of their greatest loyalty.\nFRIENDSHIP is one of the finest spiritual experiences and one of the greatest needs of the human soul. We find strength in companionship. Loss of sincere, loyal friendships has been another of the spiritual losses in our superficial, material-minded, modern age. Relief Society offers the opportunity for building close, warm, sincere friendships with women who will share their courage, vision and faith with us. The world is crying for greater understanding sincere friendships. We of the Church must demonstrate that true friendship can be had that groups of women can organize work together, study together, in understanding and sympathy the joy of one bringing joy to all, the sorrow of one bringing sorrow to all, the reputation of each being the concern of all. Spiritual life flourishes in such deeply knit groups. The Prophet Joseph Smith, when organizing Relief Society, promised, \"If you live up to your privileges, the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates.\" Are we missing this great blessing because of lack of unity and because of the apathy of some to sense their responsibilities? What great spiritual benefit, what great strength to the Church would surely come if, in every ward, all the women were united in such groups!\nAdults do not grow unless they serve. The opportunities for service in Relief Society are many. Someone has said that in service one and one are more than two but two together can accomplish more than two working alone. There is power in united effort, though the individual contribution may be small, yet if each does his share a few hours, what a wonderful contribution their united efforts make to the great Church Welfare Plan. Our little becomes part of a great whole.\nThe average attendance at Relief Society meetings is low. There is too often the feeling that absence from meetings affects only the members who absent themselves, that\nization can never realize its highest potentialities until every woman senses her responsibility, that there is an influence, a spirit, an interest and enthusiasm which the alone can give, that there is a definite plan and need for her at each meeting.\nAn unusual custom is observed in a small English country chapel at evening services. At the end of each pew is a candlestick. When the family is not constantly uses that pew is ushered in, the candle is lighted. When the family is not present the pew remains dark. When we are absent from meeting our place remains dark.\nTo every woman of the Church our Father in heaven has given the opportunities that come in Relief Society, and every woman has the responsibility for the success of the organization. As members of the Church we must choose opportunities and responsibilities are ours. There can be no question as to that. The only question is, will each one of us gratefully seize these opportunities, and will each one of us gladly accept our responsibilities?\nToday, there are many avenues of activity for women outside the home. But we have limited time and energy we must choose wisely and spend it well. It seems especially true of mothers that there is often confusion when they leave home, unless some responsible person can make for the children the little while she is away. Every woman needs mental stimulus, spiritual enrichment, friendly associates. How necessary it is that we get our values straight that our life's perspective be right and that we attend our activities accordingly. The hours spent in Relief Society are not hours selfishly spent. We put our market basket on our arm, as it were, and go forth to obtain food, spiritual food, to share with the family.\nIT is therefore vital that every woman in the Church should ask herself the question, \"Shall I be active in Relief Society?\" Each one should get her values straight and answer fairly.\nWhy Should I?\nBecause I want a living, growing testimony of the gospel and an understanding of woman's nature. The Relief Society lessons and discussions help me in this understanding.\nBecause I want to continue my education along the lines I most need. Relief Society offers an educational course which as the Prophet said is \"according to woman's nature.\"\nBecause I want intellectual and spiritual contacts with women of like ideals. Relief Society offers me these contacts.\nBecause I need sincere friendships. Relief Society offers me the opportunity for forming such friendships.\nBecause I want to get all the truth and beauty I can. I want life to be meaningful. Everything offered in Relief Society is worthwhile.\nBecause I need help in being a homemaker. Relief Society gives this help.\nBecause I want to be associated with an organization deserving my greatest loyalty. Relief Society, divinely organized and divinely directed, is worthy of my greatest loyalty.\nBecause I am thankful for the blessings the Church has brought me, I will show my appreciation by my activity. I want happiness and satisfaction in life. Our Father in heaven has told us to meet together often as sisters. I will follow his advice.\nBecause I wish to serve. In Relief Society my little becomes a part of a great service.\nBecause I have the opportunity of joining an organization which, in origin and nature, is different from all other women's organizations.\nBecause I want to face life eagerly and courageously, my faith, my loyalties must be so firmly anchored that I can read life's values accurately.\nThese are but a few of the answers that come so probably our question should not be, \"Shall I be an active member in Relief Society?\" but, \"Can I afford not to be an active member?\" CHALLENGE Mabel Jones Gabhott These words He gave to man, His challenge, rich and true; \"Love one another. Even as I love you.\""

            "content": "The Bottom Drawer Ruby Scranton Jones MAJEL hurried home as soon as school was out. It was Wednesday, the day Bart's letter came, and the thought of it had made her day bright. Yes, there it was on the hall table where Grandma always put it. She carried it to her room and began to read. She smiled at the salutation, \"My darling little Sweetheart,\" but soon frowned as she read, \"There'll be three weddings right after graduation. Why not make it four? Please, don't say 'no.' It's what I want most in the world. I'll have two weeks' leave and then I report at a field on Long Island for three months' bomber training. We could be sure of that much time together, at least.\" Majel sat in her little rocker, the letter in her lap. What was Bart thinking of? He must know a teacher couldn't run off that way without giving notice. Then there was Grandma. What would she do? Just then Grandma stopped in the doorway. \"What's the matter, Honey,\" she asked. Majel looked up into the wise old blue eyes so like her own young ones. \"Bart wants me to come to Texas and marry him next Wednesday. He should know I can't do that.\" \"Of course not,\" Grandma said indignantly. \"Such haste wouldn't be decent.\" \"But how to tell him, that's what bothers me.\" Majel took up the letter and started to read again. \"Scold him good for suggesting Page 588 such a thing.\" The little old lady dismissed the problem with a shrug. But it wasn't so simple as that. Majel and Bart had gone together since high school days. She had worn his fraternity pin since they had been juniors in the university. They had planned their life together in long, earnest talks. They knew just what kind of house they would build to accommodate the hoped for children. Always there had been a place for Grandma in their plans. When war came Bart became a pilot, not a lawyer, and they decided they would not marry until the war was over. All evening Majel worked on her answer. She explained what the principal had said about the disloyalty of teachers who left to make more money or to get married, and how she had promised to finish out the year. She told how Grandma had had several heart attacks and could not be left alone. She wrote the letter over and over but the last version sounded no more convincing than the first. Wednesday, Majel sent a telegram of congratulation to Bart. She had no letter that day but, of course, she thought, Bart would have been too busy to write. And then on Saturday she heard that Bart was home home without letting her know so she could meet him. Why would he do that, she wondered, when we haven't seen each other for nine months? He must know this is as hard for me as it is for him. SUNDAY, Majel did not go to church. She wanted to be home when Bart called. She spent an hour arranging her soft black curls in the even rows he liked. She put on a new blue suit and then changed to a rose wool dress that he had said he hoped would never wear out. And still there was no call. At last she went to her room and sat staring out the window.\nAfter dark, when she had almost given up hope, the bell rang and Bart was there. He said, \"Hello,\" as though nothing had happened and kissed her on the cheek.\n\"Lieutenant Winters,\" she said, stepping back to look at him. \"How you do set off that uniform.\" She touched the gold bar on his shoulder. \"And how tanned you are. Or is it that your hair has bleached in the Texas sun?\"\n\"A little of both,\" he said, following her into the living room.\nShe wanted desperately to throw her arms around him and tell him how proud she was, but the unusual coolness of his manner restrained her.\nJust then Grandma hurried in. She pulled down his head and kissed him. \"Bad boy,\" she said. \"Surely you wouldn't want Majel to be one of those war brides.\"\n\"Well,\" he said flushing, \"we've been engaged long enough, haven't we?\"\n\"What kind of marriage would that be?\" She shook her finger at him. \"You've plenty of time. Why, Majel's not twenty and you're only twenty-one. You're just children.\" She went out, leaving them laughing but annoyed.\n\"Oh, Bart,\" Majel said as he sat down beside her. \"You must see\nthat I couldn't break a contact. Teachers are impossible to replace and I promised to stay.\" She turned to look at him but he wouldn't meet her eyes. \"And I just couldn't leave Grandma when she's not well.\" Still he didn't speak. \"Don't you see, Bart, I just couldn't do it?\" Her tone was pleading now.\n\"No, I don't. You've always said marriage meant more to you than anything else.\" His voice rose in anger. \"Now you say a job is more important or your Grandmother.\" When Majel tried to speak, he hurried on, \"I want you to be my wife before I have to go. Is it too much to expect?\" He got up to pace back and forth, his gray eyes stormy.\nMAJEL reached out to stop him, but he stepped aside. \"Bart, dear,\" she said, \"you know how I love you and how much I want to be your wife. But what kind of marriage would that be for either of us? I wouldn't be happy because I would feel guilty, and you wouldn't be happy feeling you had persuaded me to do something wrong. We've got to plan for all the years ahead, not just for three months.\"\n\"Yes, and while you're planning, I'll be out there fighting and probably getting killed.\"\n\"Don't, Bart, don't.\" She covered her face with her hands.\nBart stopped in front of her. \"Well, marry me then if you care so much.\"\n\"There are so m many reasons why I can't,\" she sobbed.\nBart snatched up his cap and started for the door. Then he turned. \"I might have known it was that bottom drawer you cared for,\" he accused, \"and not me.\" He went out and slammed the door. Majel sat a long time thinking. How could this have happened to her and Bart who loved each other so much. And what was it he had said about her \"bottom drawer?\" Majel had been left' an orphan when she was six and had come to live with her father's mother. The old lady had kept the little gid from being too lonely by telling her stories of Ireland. The one most sure to interest her was about the Irish girls who set aside the bottom drawers of their dressers for their hope chests. So Grandma had taught her all kinds of needlework and together they had crocheted doilies, embroidered towels, hemmed napkins, and wrapped them in blue tissue and put them away in the bottom drawer of the old dresser. As the years passed, under this influence, she had come to look upon marriage as the sole interest of her life. When Barton Winters moved to their town and began to show his preference for her, Majel accepted him as the fulfilment of all her dreams. And then her bottom drawer held an added interest. She worked vacations to buy the finest sheets and pillow cases to monogram. She pieced quilts of intricate pattern, crocheted a bedspread, and lastly learned how to weave a tablecloth as dainty as a spider web. The bottom drawer had long ago become an overflowing cedar chest. She had told Bart about it as he watched her sew in the evenings they spent at home. He had shown pride in her work. \"My little housewife,\" he had said, \"my little old-fashioned girl.\" But tonight, Majel thought, he had not been proud of her. He had been disappointed and angry like one of the little boys she taught. \"DART came back the next evening and apologized. He laughed it off and took her to a movie. Tuesday evening she wanted to stay at home but Bart said they should go calling. Wednesday, they decided to have a real party with dinner and dancing at the hotel. For the first time since his return, Bart seemed natural and happy. They had given their order and Bart had just said, \"Let's try this dance,\" when Milly Andrews, a girl they had known in school, came in with another officer. When she saw Bart she hurried over. \"Hello, handsome,\" she said. \"Why didn't you let your friends know?\" She nodded to Majel and introduced her escort. \"Why can't we sit here, too?\" she asked, so Bart drew out a chair for her and they all sat down. All through the university, Milly had made no secret of her liking for Bart. When the orchestra started a particularly snappy tune she said, \"Oh, Bart, that's ours,\" and jumped up. Bart looked at Majel with raised eyebrows, so she nodded. There seemed nothing else to do. Lieutenant Jackson turned to Majel. \"Do you mind not dancing?\" he asked. \"I'm hardly up to it. I'm just out of the hospital.\" For the first time Majel looked closely. At him and noticed how pale he was. \"Of course not,\" she answered. \"It's too fast for me anyway.\" With her usual kindliness she set about to entertain him, but with half her mind she kept thinking, why, Milly would marry him tomorrow if he asked her. THE BOTTOM DRAWER 591 When the dance was over, more friends came in, so they pushed two tables together and the evening became a reception for Bart. Majel enjoyed the repartee, the dancing, two things she had missed while Bart was away. He was very attentive and she soon forgot the unhappy incident which had threatened to spoil the evening. At midnight Majel stood up. \"Fm sorry,\" she said, \"but I have to work tomorrow.\" \"Oh, yes,\" Milly laughed, \"the little school-teacher.\" Her voice showed plainly the scorn in which she held the whole profession. \"Why don't you take her home, Bart, and then come back?\" \"I guess not,\" he said as he held Majel s coat. \"I d just be extra.\" \"An extra man's not to be sneezed at these days.\" Milly shook her blond bob becomingly. All the way home Majel kept thinking, why couldn't we have had the evening to ourselves. I might have been able to explain things. I might have been able to convince him. She lay awake a long time wondering if Bart had gone back to the hotel. Should she be more demonstrative? Should she try to make Bart jealous? It would have been so easy with Lieutenant Jackson. No, no matter what happened to her she would never be like Milly. But should she forget her scruples and offer to marry him? What could a nice girl do to hold the man she loved? On Bart's last evening he was having dinner with Majel and her Grandmother, when Mary Stuart, an old friend, came in. She was incoherent with excitement but they finally gathered that she was leaving the next day to marry a man she had met the summer before and seen but twice since. \"But, Mary, you hardly know him,\" Majel said in shocked surprise. \"And how could you live on a private's pay?\" \"Why, I know him better than Fve ever known anyone,\" Mary answered indignantly. \"And as for living, Fll get a job. A stenographer can get work anywhere.\" OART got up from the table and patted her shoulder. \"Good girl,\" he said. \"You're doing exactly right. If you want him, better grab him before some other girl does.\" Mary smiled and said \"Thanks. That's the first good word I've heard.\" Majel thought, that's what he really believes. That's how he wants me to be. He can't see the difference between Mary's problem and mine. Bart left early because he was taking a midnight plane and he didn't suggest that Majel see him off. He kissed her and told her that he would write soon. She might have been just any girl he had taken out a few times. She cried when he was gone because the ten days had been such a failure. He knew, of course, that school would be out in three months, and the chief obstacle to their marriage removed, but he hadn't mentioned it. And he hadn't given her a ring. Of course, she still had his fraternity pin but a ring seemed so much more definite. She couldn't sleep, so she got up (Continued on page 613)"

            "content": "The Fight Against Infantile Paralysis Must Continue Frank S. Emery Utah State Representative, National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis  POLIOMYELITIS, commonly known as infantile paralysis, is caused by a virus, infinitesimally small, which lives on the nerve cells of the living body. The future activity of the victim depends upon the extent these nerve cells are affected.\nNow, when we think of an epidemic, most of us are beset by fear that drives all reason from us and causes us to say and do things that, on sober thought, we never would do. With any sickness, it is wise to be careful and clean, but, with any sickness, it is foolish to become panicky. Poliomyelitis is a contagious disease, but, according to our present knowledge, it is not nearly so contagious as previously assumed. However, under our statutes, a polio patient must be isolated during the acute period so that he will not expose others to this serious infection.\nIt is believed by the medical profession that poliomyelitis virus is transmitted by common vectors or carriers. Dr. John R. Paul, an epidemician at the University of Utah, who has had considerable experience in epidemics, states that a survey which he made indicates that in the 1945 epidemic were traceable to four hundred cases reported during of contracting the disease through\ndirect contact is much less likely than formerly supposed.\nHowever, there are now hundreds of victims of infantile paralysis who need care and attention from trained personnel, and hundreds more this year will swell the ranks of those afflicted with this dread disease. Early diagnosis and specialized care are essential to the well-being of a polio patient.\nPhysiotherapy is now a must in the treatment of poliomyelitis. Under the direction of competent physicians, physiotherapists are helping patients to recover from this disease and assisting crippled victims to do the things which heretofore have been regarded as impossible. Through the efforts of our medical men and women, hundreds of boys and girls, who might have been hopelessly handicapped, now have the use of their arms and legs, and, from all appearances, are normal men and women.\nTechnicians must be recruited and trained without delay. To this end, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis has outlined a program for the recruiting and training of physiotherapists who will be available at the call of qualified physicians.\nThe Foundation has set aside the sum of $1,267,600 to be used for training men and women in the art of physiotherapy. These scholarships are now making it possible for people interested in the healing arts to acquire not only a dignified and lucrative profession, but also to become of immeasurable help to their fellow men. The National Foundation is very anxious that these scholarships be used.\nThe field is not limited to the treatment of poliomyelitis, but similar methods of treatment are being used in practically every branch of medical science. As our knowledge of diseases and their cause progresses, the need for physiotherapists becomes more obvious.\nScholarships for nine to twelve months' training at approved schools of physical education, covering expenses, books, and transportation, according to the needs of qualified students. Candidates for this specialized instruction must be capable of classification within one or more of the following groups:\n(a) Graduates of approved schools of physical education.\n(b) Graduates of schools of nursing.\n(c) Students who have completed two or more years of college work, including twelve semester hours in biology and the basic sciences.\nAnyone interested in these scholarships should communicate with the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Inc., 120 Broadway, New York City 5, New York, or, more directly, with the local state or county chapter.\nFor the hundreds who are now being helped by the limited force of properly trained nurses and aides, thousands of the healing arts are needed. There are not enough trained people\ncare for those now afflicted and the many others who will undoubtedly contract the disease in future epidemics.\nIn the treatment of poliomyelitis, the application of hot-packs from the beginning is now an essential process. These hot-packs, depending upon the condition of the patient, must be applied from four to twelve times a day. In case of an epidemic, we do not have enough trained people to do this work.\nThere are many women who lack the educational requirements and the time necessary for becoming professional physiotherapists. These women may help in the fight against infantile paralysis by training themselves as aids in the nursing profession. In this way many mothers and many future mothers may learn the healing arts of hot-pack application and bedside nursing.\nThere is only one center in Utah offering proper training for nurse' aids in the treatment of poliomyelitis at the present time. A program has been outlined whereby each county will send to Salt Lake City at least three women for a tentative intensive course in hot-packing and beside nursing of infantile paralysis victims. Several competent and experienced physicians, assisted by various social service and nursing groups, will supervise this essential training. The expenses of the women will be carried by the auxiliary chapters of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis which have been organized in every county in Utah. Living quarters will be provided. When these women have completed their training, they will be asked, under the direction of the county medical authorities, to organize classes and train other women to be prepared in case of an emergency. Remember the needs of our children. Volunteer in the service of the healing arts. No mother knows when the dread poliomyelitis may strike one of her own children. If she has had training in the essential nursing procedures, a mother may render her child a service that might not otherwise be available. If you are unable to get in touch with your local chapter officers, contact the State Representative, Room 250, Union Pacific Annex, 19 West South Temple Street, Salt Lake City 1, Utah, or telephone 3-3126. Let us go forward in the fight against disease. Let us protect our children and care for them. It is today that we must prepare for the emergencies of tomorrow. \""

            "content": "Our Public Buildings Howard Barker Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, Salt Lake City Schools THE other day a five-year-old boy was \"helping\" his uncle with some carpenter work. The plane, Yankee drill, and other tools were very attractive. Without any preliminary discussion of the line of thought, the lad said, \"When you die, can I have these tools?\" His experience of the past two years in losing a father and grandmother had taught him that things outlive people. \" This might be called axiom number one in our evaluation of public buildings. Axiom number two follows very logically: of all the works of man, public buildings are among the most enduring. In spite of the disintegration of time and the elements, and even of world wars, the pyramids of Egypt, St. Peter's in Rome, the leaning tower in Pisa, and countless other structures built many generations ago are still with us. But how valuable are our public buildings? NORTH AND SOUTH EIGHTEENTH WARD, ENSIGN STAKE, SALT LAKE CITY Chapel Built 1901 Page  Are they worth maintaining in good condition? Or, is it less expensive in the long run to do. as many of us have done with our automobiles, get as much use out of them as we can for a short time and then turn them in on new ones? Some of our public buildings have been designed and built to last and serve a long time. Examples of this type in Salt Lake City are the temple, the Utah State Capitol, and the L. D. S. Church Administration Building. These can be expected to be practically as valuable after a hundred years as when they were built. They will require relatively low maintenance expenditures and they are not likely to suffer rapidly from obsolescence. They are examples of axiom number three: the better the construction, the less the cost oi maintenance. But let's talk about the average church, or school, or library, or city hall. When most of these were built their builders were probably thinking in terms of a useful life of about forty or fifty years. Many of these structures are well past that age. But, since they have been maintained fairly well, they are worth more dollars today than when built. Worth more dollars today? That's a pretty strong statement. But if it is true, Our buildings are certainly worth maintaining at a high standard. What are the facts? The present worth of a building can be fairly accurately determined if we know three things: (1) the year in which it was built, (2) its original cost, and (3) a logical estimate of its depreciation. For example, $42 bought as much in 1890 as did $100 in 1926, or as did $127 in 1944. Putting it another way, each $100 worth of building in 1890 is now worth about $302, or each $100 worth in 1926 is now worth about $127. That is, this would be the relationship if we neglect depreciation. But suppose the 1890 building should now be depreciated by fifty per cent. It would still be worth about one and a half times as much today as when built. We can then state axiom number four: buildings become worth more as the purchasing power of the dollar declines. Now as to depreciation. There are two major factors: wear and tear due to use and the elements, and obsolescence. Both of these factors can be largely overcome by replacing worn parts and by functional remodeling to meet current needs  To give an idea of the relationship of depreciation costs to total building valuations, the values for the Salt Lake City school district might be interesting. There are now about fifty buildings, having a total 1945 valuation of about $11,500,000. Many of these buildings are now more than fifty years old. But, due to lower construction costs when they were built as compared to now, and to the consistent spending of maintenance money for the improvement or replacement of floors, roofs, heating, plumbing, ventilating and lighting equipment, etc., practically all of these buildings are worth more dollars today than when they were erected. The total maintenance cost for a fifty-five year period has averaged about $1.25 per $100 valuation per year. In this connection, however, it should be kept in mind that the valuations used for this comparison have been based on annual appraisals of present value which take into account variations in construction costs, and also as accurate depreciation data as are available. ST. GEORGE STAKE TABERNACLE, ST. GEORGE, UTAH Built in   What about deferred maintenance? When a building needs painting, repairing, or the replacement of any part, nothing can be saved by waiting. In fact, deferred maintenance will not only increase the ultimate maintenance cost, but will eventually wipe out the capital investment. There's an old saying that When you need a thing you pay for it whether you buy it or not.\" Let's list that as axiom number six. Its author must have had a life-long experience maintaining buildings. Our discussion thus far has all been on the logic of maintaining our public buildings from the standpoint of economics. The facts overwhelmingly indicate that as long as a building is worth using it is worth maintaining. We cannot afford otherwise. But there is another point. Our buildings are our children inanimate, yes but we have created them. Our care of them is a pretty good index of how we live and how we think. Enter a strange house by the back door, and by the time you have reached the kitchen you will know what the living room will look like. Or, walk into the boiler room of a public building and you will know the custodian (and maybe the fellow the custodian works for). Yes, our public buildings are built to be used and enjoyed. In their planning and construction let us seek the best architectural and building talent available. Harmony of mass, color, and line can typify our culture and our hopes. FOURTEENTH WARD, SALT LAKE STAKE, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH Chapel Built in 1857 Good quality materials and workmanship can indicate our stability and our wisdom. But only good care can prove our thrift and our appreciation of the fine things of life. And, in the final analysis, this appreciation is measured in terms of such simple things as a broom, some soup, a hammer, a plane, a Yankee drill, a bucket of paint and a will to do.  Yes, Sonny, you can have my tools when I die, but remember, we can build a building in a year, but we have to take care of it for a century."

Who would wish for shadow when she could have sunshine?... Then why should we not be more wise and discreet in the choice of a husband, when, by the selection, may come life-long sorrow, tears, and wishes for an early grave.... Then we should be careful not to mistake brass for gold... To be sure that we have the real, genuine metal; then we are more confident of happiness. Ida. RESPONSE Love on! Love on! In life's maturer age, When time with iron pen fills up the page, O'er which we sigh and often drop the tear. As scenes are shifting by us year by year.  Hannah T. King  SCENES AND INCIDENTS AT WINTER QUARTERS: Lately, in looking over some old papers, I found a letter of exhortation and counsel to father's family.... Itis dated August 22nd, 1846, my eighteenth birthday, and had been preserved among father's papers: Now I shall require these things at your hands... Cease from vanity, seek humility and meekness, bow before the Lord in the morning and at eve, and in so doing your days may be many, peace and tranquility shall soothe your bosoms, health and happiness shall dwell in thy wagons, tents, wigwams and cottages, while these things are observed. Cease from murmuring or complaining, finding fault with your friend or with each other, but manifest to all men and women, by your works and the closeness of your tongues, and the integrity of your hearts, that you are right, and that God is with us of a truth. I always do, and shall expect that those which constitute my house, will remember me before the Lord, that I may have wisdom, health, patience, endurance... That I may always give suitable counsel to my family. Heber C. Kimball.  Helen Mar (Kimball) Whitney. A GOOD TESTIMONY: Fault-finding does not enhance our peace of mind, and it almost invariably disturbs that of those we most desire to promote. If we wish to be loved and trusted, then let us love and trust in return; and be sure that the best and truest way of pure happiness is to suffer wrong rather than do wrong Violet Owens. Page 600"

Cannon A MOVEMENT is on in our country to bring education into closer co-operation with daily living, national business, labor, professional, religious, and other organizations. Plans are under way for choosing committees to meet and advise with the United States Office of Education. Miss Margaret A. Hickey, President of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, is one of the representatives of the business groups. A FORMER Salt Lake woman, Dr. Beulah Ream Allen, who was living in the Phillipines in 1940, was rescued with her two sons from the Santo Tomas prison camp. The former Miss Ream put herself through medical school, principally by night-duty nursing, though medical school authorities feel that even a man cannot successfully work his way through medical training with its rigorous demands. Dr. Allen's second son was born in the prison camp. Her husband, captured at Bataan, is believed to have died in the Cabantuan camp. MORE and more Latin-American women are assuming leadership in civic, intellectual, and artistic life. Santiago, capital of Chile, has had a woman mayor, the wife of Oscar Schnake. A number of highly gifted women among our good neighbors attended the San Francisco Conference. Senora Isabel Sanchez de Urdaneta was a pioneer in introducing kindergartens into Venezuela. Dr. Berta Lutz of Brazil is a famous scientist and feminist. Senora Isabel P. De Vidal is a member of the National Senate of Uruguay. Senora Adela Formoso de Obregon Santacilia is president and founder of the Women's University, Mexico. MANY of Utah's daughters are winning recognition for outstanding achievements. Dr. Lenore Richards shows a marked talent for surgery. She is the first woman ever to be accepted in the Teaching Surgical Service of the Cincinnati State Medical School with service at the Cincinnati General Hospital. Dr. Richards instructs and is continuing her own specialized studies. MRS. Elaine Stevenson Michelsen, while living temporarily in Hartford, Connecticut, was invited to exhibit her paintings at the Hartford Public Library on the occasion of the commemoration of its founding.

With the reported cessation of hostilities in Japan and the Far East, once more the healing wings of peace are enfolding the world. And, although many of the fighting forces still remain far from their native hearthstones, the comforting assurance has come to their loved ones that no longer are they called upon to face the horrors and destruction of a total war. The year A. D. 1945 will ever mark the close of an old era?one of sorrow and grief for the mothers of men?and the beginning of a new era. The unleashing of a new force in the final phase of the war, whose future power either for good or evil seems to be incalculable, foreshadows the new world era. If the inhabitants of the earth turn to righteousness, and this power is harnessed and developed for the good of man, its future use may prove a blessing to humanity In the hands of wicked and ungodly men, however, the development of this new force, as evidenced in the action of the atomic bomb, may result in the utter destruction of the human race. Such a supposition recalls to the minds of Latter-day Saints the words of the Lord: For I, the Almighty, have laid my hands upon the nations, to scourge them for their Page 602 wickedness. And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from the earth until I have completed my work, which shall be cut short in righteousness (Doc. And Gov. 84:96-97). May the prayers of the righteous ascend upward in ceaseless supplication that a spirit of righteousness may abide in the hearts of mankind. The assurance of peace at this time brings a spirit of joy and thanksgiving to Relief Society members throughout the world. Faithfully and well through these past years have they carried on the work of the Society. With their own hearts torn and their sensibilities at times harrowed up almost beyond endurance, they have continued to meet together, oftimes under difficult conditions, to relieve the distress of the less fortunate and to mingle their fears, doubts, hopes, and even tears, in a closeness of spirit. They have added to their ability to carry on from the truths of the gospel they have been taught and from increasing the strength of their testimonies. Those women whose wounds will never entirely heal, who have been called upon to bear the supreme loss of a loved father, husband, or son, unselfishly rejoice in the happiness of their sisters and the blessings still remaining to them. With the removal, of the terrible anxiety which has oppressed the EDITORIAL 603 spirits of the women of the Church, and with restrictions on meetings lifted, there must come to Relief Society a great upwelling and resurgence of power. The future lies ahead unknown, but all the calls that may come to the Society will be met if members answer every call made upon them as individuals. Each day the Church Welfare Plan broadens and deepens. The part of Relief Society women in this Plan is great. The responsibility of the Society in saving souls by teaching and living the gospel, is also great. Only by a rededication by the women of the Church?the young ones as well as the older ones?to the work of Relief Society will it be able to fulfill its destiny in the years ahead. Endowed with the grace of humble hearts and contrite spirits, the women of the Church everywhere will work together?for only through their magnificent, united accomplishments will the unbounded potentialities of Relief Society be realized. And the righteousness of the daughters of Zion will be pleasing unto the Lord. M. C. S. THE fall time, the waning of the year, to some people foreshadows a season of dryness and decay, to be followed by the blanketing numbness of winter. So it appeared to the poet Bryant who lamented: The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year; Of wailing winds and naked woods, and meadows brown and sere. To such people the fall seems a dread season, a time of regret and heartache, of farewell to happy, carefree days, and a time to shoulder the burdens which are waiting. The word \"fall\" itself connotes a time of decline, an ebbing away of the fulness, a gradual withdrawing of pulsating life which leaves behind but a hardened shell, an empty husk, and a baren waste. To others, the third quarter of the year is best described by the term new ?John Banister Tabb \"autumn,\" an uncertain time, typifying the unpredictable, the colorful, whirling, restless season of the year when activities which have been slumbering in the hot, languorous days of summer are revived; when the blood quickens in tempo with the biting winds without, and energy and spirit are renewed. The keen expectancy of a new school year with friendships and pleasures still untested, seems to pervade the very air. The snatching of unlearned books, the rushing out to meet playmates, the boisterous chatter of children, gaily attired in plaids and brilliant sweaters to match the kaleidoscopic colors of the foliage, punctuates the stillness of the morning. The noontide quiet is shattered by the calls of the released boys and girls who run home, sniffing and exclaiming over the sharpness of pepper-red chili sauce, the acrid tang of pickles or the cloying sweetness of preserves, and the unforgettable odor of freshly baked bread. The dancing leaves outside the kitchen door cast a living applique of shadow over the luncheon scene. Tempting samples from bottles whose contents are to be more fully enjoyed in the long months ahead, make these occasions ones to be cherished and recalled in future years. Such sunny, bright days may be interrupted by days of winds and rain, when the family gathers in close companionship around a crackling grate fire, and gratitude wells up in the hearts of the surrounding half circle for the plenty and security found within the beloved home. And after such days of blustery rains and squalls comes a ring of days, each one a jewel reflecting russet, saffron, taffeta tans or tawny orange, with here and there the glowing red of the sumac on the hill, all set in a gleaming band of maple gold. The season of all seasons?Indian summer. Then, as the days grow short and night shadows lengthen, the blaze of color painted by the Master Artist is swept away by the mighty brush of winds, and the mind comes to accept the changelessness of changes?of the season, moods, and circumstances. Over the glory of the beauty that was autumn imperceptibly but surely steals the gaunt, stark beauty of the winter. One is. Led to acknowledge the hand of the Lord over all in the inevitableness and lightness of the changes that enter into the lives of his children, as in the seasons, and to accept, with thankfulness, the sorrows, as well as the joys, of mortality.

'Tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! Were these lines written in 1945, before the end of the war? No, but they might have been as far as their application is concerned, and yet they were penned by the hand of Shakespeare in the sixteenth century. Unbelievable, do I hear you say, that our mechanized and scientific world should have come from that unweeded garden of the sixteenth century? And yet it did. On the same foundation, may we not hope that four hundred years from now it will seem unbelievable to our descendants that out of the economic and social chaos of 1945, the idealistic order of that day could have come? Nevertheless, I believe it will be said. NOTES TO THE FIELD Relief Society Singing Activities Encouraged IT is gratifying to know that, despite these strenuous times, so many of the Relief Society singing groups have remained intact and have been able to keep their membership and often have increased it. We realize that due to the restrictive conditions that have been brought about because of the war this has not been possible in some areas.\nThe General Board appreciates the fine leadership and effort that have been put into the organizations of the Singing Mothers and that have made them distinctive and valuable.\nThose who participate in these singing groups receive many cultural benefits as well as rendering worthy service to the Relief Society and\nto the Church in general. This was definitely emphasized by our beloved President Grant in the following lines:\nThe singing of our sacred hymns written by the servants of God has a powerful effect in converting people to the principles of the gospel and in promoting peace and spiritual growth. Singing is a prayer to the Lord, as He has said: \"For any soul delighteth in the song of the heart: yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.\"\nWe therefore hope that every Relief Society member who is able to sing will affiliate herself with these singing groups and receive the blessings and inspiration of such endeavor."

In order to show them that Jeff means nothing to her, and yet save her face in the affair with Hugh, Delsa decides to appear captivated by Alec Windsor, a marine visiting Delsa's friend, Jim Lewis. THE whole town was excited over Jim's and Lina's wedding. No one was so small, so unimportant, that he didn't have a part in the preparations that now went forward. Jim and Lina were to go to Salt Lake City on Thursday and be married in the temple. Then they would return home, and that evening a big reception would be given for them. Not only was the whole town invited?but the whole valley, as well. Friends and relatives from far and near would gather in the ward amusement hall to wish the young couple happiness, and to dance and eat. \"It's going to be a real, old-fashioned wedding,\" Lina told Delsa happily. \"Dad and Mother think it would be nice to have a get-together like they used to have, years ago. In spite of rationing, some of the women think they can get up a good, hot meal. There'll be dancing and a program?everyone who wants to take part on the program can.\" Delsa smiled. \"I wonder if you know what you're Page 606 letting yourself in for?\" she asked. 'Tve heard Mother tell of those old-time affairs?they lasted a good part of the night. You'll be tired after the day in Salt Lake?going through the temple and all.\" \"I don't care!\" Lina said, \"if Mother and Dad and Jim's folks want an old-time party again, we'll give it to them. We've been so sober for so long. We're going to be happy and all together again for once!\" Talk of the wedding even permeated the schoolroom and grounds. Nellie Gibson was learning a recitation to say at Lina's wedding, and the girls' quartet was practicing a song. Delsa stayed after school and played the piano for them. Jeff came over and leaned his elbows on the piano and beat time for the girls, watching Delsa over the bright heads of the youngsters. After the practicing was over, Jeff and Delsa walked down the road toward Jeff's house together. Jeff said, with a strange urgency in his voice, \"Are you going to let me take you to the wedding, Delsa?\" Delsa laughed, surprise giving a ring to her voice. \"Oh, Jeff! You know I don't go anywhere with anyone!\" Jeff smiled wryly. \"I should think you could go with your principal without hurting your conscience at all. Goodness knows, Delsa, I haven't any idea of beating Hugh's time. It's just that everyone will be going and I thought Delsa put her hand impulsively \"How has the town been treating on Jeffs arm. You?\" Delsa put her hand impulsively on Jeff's arm.\n\"It's all right, Jeff,\" she said. She had remembered, then, that she was no longer bound to Hugh. She could go to the dance with anyone she chose. She felt suddenly cold and alone.\nJEFF must have been watching her face more closely than she knew for he spoke quickly. \"Don't look like that, Delsa. Hugh'll be back one of these days and then we'll all be dancing at your wedding. I'm sorry I made you unhappy.\"\nThey went on in silence, each busy with his own thoughts, until they reached Jeff's gate and Davy came running to meet them.\nBut when Delsa's work at Jeff's had been done and she went out into the clear blue night, she was startled to see a man's form leaning over the gate, obviously waiting for her. She knew at once that it wasn't Jeff; and almost as immediately she knew who it was?Alec Windsor, the forest green of his marine uniform dark against the starlit sky.\n\"Hello, there!\" he said happily, familiarly, as if he had waited for her every night for years.\nDelsa smiled up at him. \"This is a surprise!\" she cried. \"It's been a long, long time since there were young men in town with leisure to lean on gates!\"\nHe answered soberly, \"It's been a long, long time since I had leisure to lean on a gate, I assure you. But now that I do have the leisure, I am going to make good use of it.\"\nHe fell into step beside her and they walked up the wind-tossed path to Marriott home.\n\"How has the town been treating you?\" Delsa asked, for want of something better to say.\n\"Fine!\" he laughed. \"Only everyone is so busy with Jim and Lina and plans for the wedding, I've had to shift for myself a bit today. Not that I mind,\" he hastened to add, \"but I had plenty of time to remember you and how pretty you looked last night with that blue ribbon in your hair. Gosh,\" he went on, \"what you girls could teach those South Sea natives?or could you?\"\nDelsa laughed. It was definitely pleasant to have someone to walk with in the cool spring evening. And when Alec took her arm and drew her a little closer to his side, she felt the old, half-forgotten thrill of being liked and protected.\nThey walked slowly, talking of many things, and when they reached Delsa, she turned and looked up at the tall, dark, serious boy who reminded her so much of Hugh.\n\"Come in and have supper with us,\" she invited.\nHe hesitated a moment, and then smiled like a little boy caught in mischief.\n\"Thanks,\" he said.\n\"But I can get Dad to step over and tell your friends . . .\" she began, but he grinned more broadly.\n\"I've already told them that I might not be home to supper,\" he said. \"I had hopes.\"\n\"Oh, you marines!\" Delsa laughed, and opened the door.\nHer parents were happy to have a young man at the table again, and the meal went gaily. Afterward, Alec put on one of Mrs. Marriott's aprons and wiped the dishes for Delsa. \"WHEN the kitchen was shipshape and Delsa would have gone into the living room where her parents were, Alec stopped her. \"Let's sit here in the kitchen/\" he suggested. \"Gosh, it's been so long since I sat in a real kitchen!\" He sniffed audibly. \"I like the smell of it!\" So they drew up chairs and sat beside the table with its red-checked cloth, and talked, with Alec getting up now and then to put sticks of wood into the big, old-fashioned stove. After a while Delsa said, \"It's rather late in the year for popping corn?we generally do that in the winter time. But we still have some good corn left?and it's always fun!\" So they popped corn and sprinkled it with salt and with homemade, unrationed butter, and ate it in big handfuls. But at last Alec had to go. He frowned at the big wooden clock ticking away persistently on the kitchen shelf, and said, \"You're a school marm, and I know what modern kids are. You'll need all the reinforcement of a good night's sleep to handle them, I bet.\" Delsa smiled. \"These children aren't bad,\" she said. \"They are just the town kids?I've known them all ever since they were born. I've taught them in Sunday School and Primary?and they aren't spoiled like city children. They all have plenty of work to do in their homes ?it makes them more responsible and obedient.\" He looked at her wonderingly. \"You really like them, don't you?\" he asked. \"I wonder if I ever had a teacher that really liked me?\" \"Of course you did, silly!\" Delsa said with a sudden tightening of her throat. Alec reached across the table and put his big, brown, hard hand over hers. \"Who's taking you to the wedding dance, Delsa?\" he asked gently. THERE it was, her chance, handed to her on a silver platter. But she couldn't take it?not just yet. Delsa thought of Hugh and of Jeff. She could go with Alec?but that was so sudden. It might fool her mother and Hugh's mother, who wanted her to be attracted by the newcomer; but it wouldn't fool Jeff Holden. He would think she had refused him and then had accepted Alec's invitation to show him that she didn't care for him at all? that she didn't want even to trust him as her escort to Jim's and Lina's wedding. She shook her head gently. \"No one,\" she said. \"I go with Mother and Dad.\" Alec opened his hand, which now held hers, and looked down at her fingers. Hugh's ring, a simple little token?but all that she had wanted ? circled her finger. The tiny diamond winked up at Alec, like a bright tear. \"He's pretty wonderful, I'll bet, to have a girl like you waiting for him.\" Delsa felt that she ought to defend her position, somehow. She began, hesitatingly, \"And there's Millie, Alec. Oh, I don't want to point out your social obligations-it's not that?but I know Millie would feel hurt if you took me?\" A sudden smile broke across Alec's dark features, and he squeezed her hand gently. \"You're absolutely (Continued on page 620) Flowers and Fruit for the Table Adele Matheson AT the table the family gains the fuel for living. Children grow and develop from its bounties. Three times each day, through all seasons, parents, children, relatives, and friends come together to participate in the all-essential requirement for physical survival. What, then, must be the importance of this homely routine? What can be done to lift this commonplace function into a less prosaic experience? The piquancy of well-selected and carefully prepared food is an indispensable requirement. Beyond this, resourcefulness, art, and skill must be constantly employed to give surprise and zest to table arrangements. The mother-hostess must never give way to the mere \"feeding of the family\" routine. Never should our loved ones be called to surround a \"tired table.\" Color is a pleasant invitation to happy dining. Its use is not expensive, and color demands no drudgery. Use color in flowers and fruit, in dishes and table linen. Create colorful food combinations and watch the effect of lifted spirits and congenial gaiety when the diners see the fresh beauty that beckons them to the table.

Sightless, they ride among the enemy And conquering soar into the coming year. Now frost and thought of future goading her The gentian floats her parachutist free, Trusting to filaments of gossamer A century's emerald genealogy. The future is flung into the couch of fall? The green world's minute infants swaddled tight In sheaths of brown, impervious but small? To brave alone the winter and the night. THE BOTTOM DRAWER 613 The Bottom Drawer (Continued from page 591) and sat on the floor beside her cedar chest. She took out all her beautiful things and looked at them one by one. What dreams and hopes she had put into them and now they seemed to be the barrier between her and Bart. With a sigh, she replaced them carefully. I'd better get back to bed, she thought. No matter how I feel I must be on hand to teach the children in the morning. One afternoon the next week when Majel got home she found Grandma lying on the couch gasping for breath. The doctor looked grave as he said accusingly, \"You?ve been worrying about something.\" To Majel at the door, he said, \"It's this war. Keep her from thinking about it. She can stand about one more attack like that.\" Majel went back and knelt by the couch. She smoothed back the soft white hair. \"You've been worrying about me,\" she said. \"Well, you just get well and I'll be all right.\" As she got dinner she thought back over the thirteen years she had lived with her grandmother. She must have been a trial at first and a great responsibility. Grandma might have had a very different life without her? trips and friends of her own age. She shouldn't have let Grandma put her through college either. She knew now that she had done right in staying. Bart's letters came now at irregular intervals, sometimes three weeks apart. They were interesting, though, telling of places around New York he visited, of dances at the field. But he never used the extravagant terms of endearment that had so amused her, and he never mentioned the future. Soon after school was out in June, a different kind of letter came. He wrote, \"Sometimes when I'm ten thousand feet up I have the strangest impulse to turn west and fly straight back to you. Instead, I'll probably soon be moving east where I can't even be sure of your prim, sweet little letters.\" This was too much for Majel. She went to her room and cried a long time. When Grandma called her to dinner her eyes were still red but Grandma seemed not to notice. It was not until they were clearing the table that she asked, \"You got a letter, didn't you?\" Majel said, \"Yes.\" \"Is he about through at Long Island?\" Another \"yes\" was all Majel could manage. They were washing the dishes when Grandma spoke again. \"You know what I'd do? I'd go and marry him before he goes. I'd fly to get there.\" Nothing in Majel's life had ever surprised her so much. \"Why, Grandma,\" she faltered. \"You?ve always said such marriages weren't decent.\" GRANDMA interrupted impatiently. \"I can change, can't I? I'm in this war, too, and everybody says war changes people.\" \"But he hasn't asked me to come,\" Majel objected. Grandma seemed not to hear. \"You could leave tomorrow and you needn't worry about me. I'm going to visit Cousin Clara. I've already written to her.\"\nThen Majel laughed and hugged her tight. \"You're not fooling me a bit,\" she said, \"but I'll do it. You start packing while I get reservations.\"\nWhen Majel saw Bart all her confidence left her. But his hug and kiss were ardent enough. He guided her over towards the cafe saying, \"We'll get something to eat while the baggage is being sorted.\"\nNot until they were through did he demand, \"Now tell me, what's the idea?\"\n\"Is it too late?\" Majel asked, scarcely above a whisper.\n\"You surely don't mean you'd marry me now when you wouldn't three months ago. Why, we could have only two or three days together.\"\nMajel spoke rapidly. \"You thought it was a home with nice things I wanted. But it wasn't. All those things in my 'bottom drawer' were just?just something to keep me busy while I waited. I could be happy with you in an auto court even. It was my contract. If was my responsibility to Grandma. Oh, Bart, I've been so unhappy because you didn't understand.\"\n\"Understand?\" At last he said, \"Maybe I do now. I've done a lot of thinking.\" He paused?then laughed. \"Why, I suppose, marriage to you is a sort of contract and ?and?a responsibility.\"\n\"Yes, oh, yes,\" she said.\n\"And I could be sure of having a wife waiting for me when the war is over?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Oh, my dear, I guess I like you just the way you are.\" He took from his pocket a little green velvet box. In it were two rings?one with a large diamond and the other a band. As Majel watched with shining eyes, he took out the engagement ring, reached across the table for her hand and slipped the ring on.\n\"There,\" he said, \"I've had them three months.\" Then his voice took on a familiar, teasing tone. \"Not that I haven't tried to find someone in New York to give them to.\"\nWhen Majel heard that tone she knew that everything was right between them. She brushed. \"No one would look twice at you. They could all see the sign 'taken' right across your forehead.\"\nBart got up. \"Come on,\" he said, \"I understand it takes time to get married in New York and we haven't a minute to lose.\""

'The theme was inspired by the current study of biblical literature in the regular Relief Society outline.

These characters, most beloved by the Savior, were played by left to right: Florence Hill as Martha; Lucile Cederlof as Mary; Adele Matheson as Mary, mother of Jesus; Ruth Romney' as Elizabeth; in front. Lota Lamoreaux as Mary Magdalene. The production was written by Genet B. Dee, President of Garden Park Relief Society, and was produced by Adele Matheson. Poge  Mary, the mother of Jesus, unfolded the marvelous story of the miracle of the coming of the Son of God. She told the appealing and human story of the mother and her son from his birth and childhood to his tragic crucifixion. The raising of Lazarus from the dead and the sojourn of the Savior within their humble home, was skillfully depicted in conversation between Martha and Mary. The story of Mary Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, was recalled in its forceful simplicity and the dramatic summary of the scene at the cross which concluded the story. \"Appropriate musical numbers interspersed the program: 'A Voice in the Wilderness? 'Prepare Ye the Way/ and 'He is Risen/ were rendered by Elaine Tomlinson; 'I Think When I Read That Sweet Story of Old/ by Wanda Gibb; 'Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?' rendered by the Garden Park Girls' Chorus; and 'I Know That My Redeemer Liveth sung by Edward O. Piatt. \"The authentic costumes, together with appropriate background and music, contributed to an atmosphere of dignified solemnity, and through the spoken word the characters appeared to actually live their parts.

But this won't keep you from dancing with me, will it?\" and he frowned at the little ring. \"Of course not,\" Delsa laughed. \"I love to dance, do you?\" He nodded, and let go of her hand. Rising, he reached for his cap, which he had hung on a hook behind the door when he came in. Delsa followed him, and as he stood, waiting to leave, twirling his cap in his two hands, Delsa thought, how lonely he is! How alone and away from all the folks that love him ?his mother?his sweetheart! That's the way Hugh was, down there in Australia! She laid her hands on his arm, feeling the rough texture of the cloth beneath her palms. \"Drop in any time,\" she said. \"If you feel lonely, come here. The Lewises, of course, are wrapped up in their plans for Jim?but we have nothing to distract us. Mother and Dad would love it?\" He bent toward her in that slanting, eager posture so like Hugh's and said, \"It's been a wonderful evening, Delsa. And I am going to take you at your word?I am going to drop in here often. I only wish I could go to school, too!\" A FTER he was gone Delsa went slowly upstairs to her room, but her mother called to her from her AND FOR ETERNITY 621 bedroom, and Delsa turned and went in. \"He's a nice boy,\" her mother said, with a little gesture that reminded Delsa of the past?of the many nights she had come in from a dance or a party to sit on the pieced coverlet and tell her mother and father of the good time she had had. T But Delsa didn't sit down tonight?the old easy confidence was gone? gone with Hugh?though her mother didn't know it yet. Now between them lay a shadow of restraint and, perhaps, deceit. So Delsa stood beside the bed, ignoring that gentle gesture, and said, \"He's had a tough time, out there.\" \"I could see that,\" her father went on, and his gruff voice was gentle. \"I don't suppose he told you much about the fighting? It's terrible?I can't help thinking of all our boys?\" Delsa patted his heavy, calloused hand where it lay on the coverlet. \"You took yours in the last war. Dad,\" she said softly. \"I guess the boys can take theirs now.\" They talked a little longer, and Delsa stooped and kissed her parents before she went out of the room. Somehow, tonight, she felt sorrier for them than for herself. They both loved Hugh so much. He had taken the place of the son they had never had, and her father had been the only father Hugh had known. \"If it were only my problem alone!\" she whispered, \"I could go away?I could even face it here. But it is theirs, too. Hugh, Hugh, did you forget Dad?did you forget the pony he gave you when you were ten?the days you have helped him stack hay?the way he taught you to box and wrestle so you could hold your own with the bigger boys? Did you forget mother? and her cookies and her presents?her affection that gave you two mothers where less fortunate boys have but one?\" She knelt by the window, looking out over the trees to where the snowy crest of the mountain that guarded the valley stood pale and white in the moonlight. Between the mountain and her window lay the acres of her father's farm, and beyond them other acres, and then the road and the foothills where she and Hugh had gone Eastering and May walking and hunting pine nuts and cutting Christmas trees. \"I am not a dog in the manger,\" she told herself at last, \"hanging onto Hugh when he is tired of me and wants to be free. I am remembering my parents and Aunt Martha?and I am holding on for them, too.\" Suddenly she bent her head onto her arms and cried, \"And for you, too, Hugh?Oh, now, tonight, I know how you must have felt, out there. And, tonight, I don't blame that girl so much?I know how she must have felt, too.\" To be continued)"

That activity had been planned and carried out by Sister Thelma Kam-merman, work director of Parley's Ward, Highland Stake. The General Board believes that by sponsoring different types of sewing activities in work meetings, all members of Relief Society, the young as well as the older, may become actively interested in sewing and take part in the sewing program of Relief Society. This month Sister Melvina Sheets describes another type of sewing activity for providing Christmas gifts which was carried on very successfully in her ward. \"If you were to have visited the Highland Park Ward, Highland Stake, on the second Tuesday of last October, you would have had a glimpse of busy mothers, grandmothers ? yes, even great-grandmothers all enthusiastically working. Some were cutting, some sewing, others pulling bits of white fluffy cotton from large bats and stuffing it firmly into varied shapes for legs, arms, heads, tails, ears and bodies. Stuffed toys were in the making! Page 622 There were dolls with embroidered faces, short and tall Raggedy Anns and Andys, baby dolls, upside-down dolls, and a big doll?a girl thirty-two inches tall, complete with panties, slip, dress, and bonnet, or perhaps with a large bow in her yarn hair. There were brunettes, blondes, and redheads, a complexion to suit anyone's choice. \"Cuddly animal toys proved to be popular with the younger mothers, such as: Jumbo, the elephant with his great floppy ears?with a tiny Jumbo, too; the long-necked giraffe and baby with ruffled manes; Scotty, the bow-wow dog; the pony so proud of his long yarn mane and tail; the teddy bear; Peter Rabbit with his pink eyes, ears, and nose; but better still, the white wooly lamb with colored face and tummy which proved to be a favorite with everyone. \"It was while helping my niece make a set of rag dolls for her tiny daughter that the idea had come to me that this might be an answer to the Christmas suggestion question. I had immediately gone pattern hunting and had been pleasantly surprised to find so many patterns for different animals and dolls. I also cut additional patterns in order to have plenty on hand so that everyone one would be able to keep busy and happy.\nIn order to know the amount of material needed and to familiarize myself with each pattern, I made up one article of each pattern. Being very thrilled and satisfied with my menagerie, I placed the toys on display at our next Relief Society meeting. Thus began weeks of work and fun. Each mother, grandmother, sister, or great-grandmother was anxious to make the toy of her choice.\n\"I asked for pieces of material ranging from one and a half yards to only a quarter of a yard, and these were put in a scrap bag to be used as needed. We used peach-colored washable chintz for the faces, arms, and legs of the dolls. This I purchased, along with the cotton bats for stuffing, the string yarns (black, brown, yellow, and rust) for the hair, and the large, white bath towels for the little lambs. It was found that five lambs could be cut from two towels.\n\"Our project was most successful. A repeat program of this type has been requested, and we are planning to make an entire beginner's class next year.\"\nPATTERNS Norma Wrathall We grasp the threads of life with unskilled hands. And start to weave the pattern of our days; The passing years bring wisdom, but the strands Are tangled by the time we?ve learned their ways. We long, we strive, to weave the brighter hues. As youthful hours pass like summer sun. But soon, unwilling fingers start to use The somber tones, where hidden shadows run. Our thoughts, our acts, our very lives remain To bind the threads, unwavering, to the end; We dare not cut or break a single skein? For strands like these, once torn, may never mend. LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 12?Building an Empire in the West Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, January 8, 1946 Objective: To indicate the continued fulfillment of prophecy concerning the gathering of Israel. THE day which followed the arrival of the first company of saints into the valley of the Great Salt Lake was the Sabbath. Fittingly enough this should have been so, for these were a people who had chosen the Lord for their king. In their struggling efforts to establish his kingdom in the East, the Mormon people had found nothing but bitter opposition. Therefore, the Lord led his people where they would be unmolested in their efforts to establish his work.\nTo bring the nations of the earth to a knowledge of the literal establishment of such a kingdom was, however, the purpose of God. In his wisdom, therefore, he prepared a place for his saints to gather where they might become strong, a place of refuge among the towering rocks and hidden valleys of the mountains. Here, as a peculiar people, they too must be prepared, that they live and obey his laws, which eventually all men, too, must obey if they would enjoy peace and the blessings of prosperity.\nPresident Brigham Young's first advice to the saints on that July 25, 1847, was concerning one of the laws of God?that of keeping the Sabbath day holy. Weakened as a result of an illness which had seized him just before the company of first pioneers entered the Valley, he expressed his wishes briefly. Elder Wilford Woodruff recorded his remarks as follows: \"He told the brethren that they must not work on Sunday; that they would lose five times as much as they would gain by it. None were to hunt on that day and there should not any man dwell among us who would not observe these rules. They might go and dwell where they pleased, but should not dwell with us\" (Josmer Paramos Saints without Halos in Church History, page 451).\nThese remarks and the spirit which prompted them were typical of the serious manner with which\nPage 624 LESSON DEPARTMENT 625 the followers of this Prophet regarded the literal acceptance of God's word. Within the period of the first ten years that followed the entrance of the saints into the promised land, they set to work with zeal bringing about the fulfillment of many of the great and beautiful prophecies of the seers of old. It was an eventful ten years from 1847 to 1857. Within this decade, hundreds of Mormons, from many nations of the earth, having left their homes, streamed into the Valley. There was hard work to be done if the desert was to blossom as the rose, and scouting expeditions to be sent throughout the vast mountain regions if the stakes of Zion were to be set and lengthened (Isa. 54:2). An actual ensign was to be raised upon the hills that all people who would hear might know that Zion was again, and that they could flow into it. Temples were to be erected, since God had said that his people were always commanded to build a holy house unto his name (Doc. And Gov. 124:39). The land of Deseret or the \"Honey Bee\" it would become, as the Book of Mormon term implied. Visioning the industry and zeal with which the latter-day work of Israel would be carried forth, Isaiah, the ancient prophet, wrote: And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolation and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations (Isaiah 61:4). And of the people and their abode, he said: He that walketh righteously, and speak-eth uprightiy; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands firom holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off. Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? Where is the receiver? Where is he that counted the towers? Thou shall not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand. Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities; thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby\" (Isaiah 33:15-21). The actual story of the events which now are history and which now outline the early acts performed in laying the foundations of an empire in the West are filled with the color of human endeavor, courage and self-sacrifice. Soil was broken on the 23rd and 24th of July, that the seed so carefully treasured during the journey west might find its early germination in the Valley. When Monday morning, July 26th, arrived, eager exploring parties set out, some to the west of the valley beyond the Western Jordan River. John Brown and Joseph Matthews were among this group. Others went east into the canyons to return with reports of good timber. Wil-ford Woodruff and a party turned north to discover warm springs, and the next day they went west again into the Tooele valley. It was Orson Pratt who, on the trip, climbed a mountain to view Utah Lake. All companies returned with the feeling  that their present site in the valley of the Great Salt Lake was the best place in which to lay out the city with its temple to the Lord. It was on the 26th also that a party, including President Brigham Young ascended what is now known as \"Ensign Peak\" to the north of Salt Lake. Here it was the desire of President Young to lift up an ensign to the nations spoken of by the Prophet Isaiah.\nBy the 28th, President Young had designated the site upon which the temple to the Lord would be built. He said: \"Here is the forty acres for the temple, and the city can be laid out perfectly square north and south, east and west.\"\nEvents throughout the rest of the summer months moved on smoothly. A fort was built on the square now known as Pioneer Park in Salt Lake City. This, it was felt, would serve as a protection against the Indians who by now were crowding around the saints to beg and steal. With the return of part of the Mormon Battalion, added strength was given to the colony. On October 3, 1847, a conference was held at which Elder John Smith, uncle of the Prophet Joseph Smith [and great-grandfather of President George Albert Smith], was sustained as the first president of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion. The year 1847 closed with a total of 2,095 souls in the Salt Lake Valley.\nOne of the most beautiful stories for the saints of the first years in the mountains is that of the crickets and the gulls. The feeding of Elijah by the ravens will ever be remembered to stir the love for birds and their courage to share when it is scarce, where in modern times can one turn for a more inspiring account of mercy from the skies than to that of the winged gulls from off the shores of Great Salt Lake.\nNo real crop was gathered by the saints for the season of 1847. The pioneers had arrived too late that year to expect much of a harvest. It was then to the spring and summer of 1848 that they must look for a yield if they were to live. The planting season for that year came, and, as the tender shoots pushed forth, the hopes for a bountiful harvest were high. May and June, however, brought not only the sunshine, but danger. Armies of marching crickets trooped down from the mountain sides to mow the fields. Trenches were dug, fires built, cattle and men called to tramp out the insects, but to no avail. Finally, in tearful supplication, the saints poured out their hearts to the Lord for deliverance. As they raised their eyes, what appeared to be a black cloud overhead shortly took shape in the form of hundreds of white-breasted gulls. At first, stricken by fear, lest these birds had come to finish what the crickets had left, the saints stolidly watched. But fear was not to be their lot, for, instead of feasting upon the crops, the birds hacked at the pests, and, gorging themselves, winged off to disgorge their feed. They returned again and again to repeat the attack until, with raucous cries, they wheeled into the air and vanished from sight. It was the miracle of the gulls these modern children of Israel had witnessed. Today, upon Temple Square in Salt Lake City, there stands the fine monument of its kind to a bird, and beneath its shaft is cast, in bronze, the story of the Utah seagull. LESSON DEPARTMENT 627 In other early accounts of this beginning empire in the West are recorded the stories of trips by President Brigham Young and others of the leading brethren back and forth across the plains to Winter Quarters. They were ever interested in bringing safely into the land of Zion the many souls who daily were embracing the gospel. It was on one of the trips back to Missouri that the apostles met and organized the First Presidency with Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards as the first three men to hold these offices in the presidency since the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hy-rum. About that time, too, Oliver Cowdery returned to the Church and again was baptized a member. In Zion, in the month of March 1849, the first political convention was called. The saints were desirous of having their territory under the flag of the United States. Then, in September of 1850, President Millard Fillmore appointed the first federal officers for the Territory of Utah with Brigham Young as governor. The years ahead were to be stormy since, in the main, weak officials who sought personal gains in office were sent to assume control over the saints in their new Territory. A most important event of these years came with the laying of the cornerstones of the temple on April 6, 1853. Each stone was laid with dedicatory prayers of thanksgiving. Among the significant thoughts expressed that day were these by President Brigham Young: We dedicate the south-east corner stone of the temple to the Most High God. May it remain in peace till it has done its work, and until He who has inspired our hearts to fulfil the prophecies of His holy prophets, that the house of the Lord should be reared in the \"tops of the Mountains\" shall be satisfied, and say it is enough. (Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, page 482). The prophecies of old are being fulfilled. * Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word.\" 1. In the month of December 1830 came the word of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith concerning the place of Zion. It reads, \"Keep all the commandments and covenants by which ye are bound; and I will cause the heavens to shake for your good, and Satan shall tremble and Zion shall rejoice upon the hills and flourish\" (Doc. And Gov. 35:24). Why were the hills to which the saints were to go so desirable a place for God's people? Bring in a map of the Rocky Mountain region centered about Utah. Find in some history text an account of the \"Land of the Northern Mystery\" (The Great Salt Lake Basin). See Howard R. Driggs, Westward America, page 16. Read Doc. And Gov. 38:13-22. Note especially verse 19. This revelation was given at the third general conference of the Church. 2. What may those expect who keep the commandments and inherit the land of Zion? Read and discuss the revelation given through Joseph, the Seer in Jackson Gounty, Missouri, August 7, 1831 (Doc. And Gov. 59). See Doc. And Cov. Commentary, pages 246-247. Footnote. Assign chapter 40, Essentials in Church History, for additional facts of interest concerning the first months in the Valley. Also see \"Utah's First July 24th Celebration,\" by Harold H. Jenson, Improvement Era, July 1942. Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 4-Charity Vaunteth Not Itself, Is Not Puffed Up Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, January 8, 1946 Objective: To show that true charity is self-forgetting. JESUS spoke this parable: Unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one, a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted\" (Luke 18:9-14). Jesus did not condemn the Pharisee because of his righteousness, because he was not an unjust person, an extortioner or an adulterer, nor because he paid tithes and fasted twice a week. These good deeds were all to his credit. His sin consisted in the self-righteous pleasure he took in his own goodness. It is only when we forget ourselves that we can be our best selves, that we can act in our full power and strength. Consciousness of self inhibits the free expression of oneself in any walk of life. A self-conscious speaker is ineffective. A beautiful girl loses much of her attractiveness if she acts conscious of it. Charity cannot both display and express itself at the same time. Charity means to love and to give. This, one cannot do with self-glorification or benefit in mind. That would be a contradiction. Jesus asked that we always act with singleness of purpose. He said not to give to be seen of men, but \"when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.\" He wanted us to give for the sake of giving. He asks us to love our fellow men freely, spontaneously, without fear of punishment or hope of reward. A friend relates this experience in giving: \"One Sunday afternoon I decided to visit a bed-ridden friend, thinking it would be a Christian way to spend the Sabbath and that I might render him a service. I found him in much pain, yet he talked cheerfully and not of himself. His suffering had tempered his spirit, developing in him humility and a deep compassion for others. I left his home profoundly moved and spiritually quickened, and I felt ashamed that I had thought of myself as they giver and of him as the receiver of my benevolence.? \"Charity vaunteth not itself, not puffed up?seeketh not her own.? The only check on our charity should be effectiveness in the lives of others. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 4?Bible Influence as Revealed in Our Narrative and Epic Poetry Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, January 22, 1946 CHAUCER, often called the father of English literature, gave us in his Canterbury Tales outstanding narrative poetry. In this group of stories, preserved vibrantly by a literary master, we have an artistic portrayal of England in the Middle Ages. With picturesque old English, which, well-voiced, brings a charm and flavor of its own, the poet tells of \"myrie and Niceity in a companie of sondry folk\" who are making a pilgrimage about Easter time to pay homage to a \"holy blissful martyr\" who has \"holpen hem (them) whan that they been seke (sick).\" To while time away on the long journey to and from Canterbury, the travelers relate favorite tales. These, like the different storytellers, mirror the spirit, the custom, the people of that \"olden tyme.\"\nNaturally, with such personages as a prioress, a nun, a monk, a pardoner, a friar, and a poor parson, in the company, we are brought closer to the religious thought and practices of the people, a keen observer, sketches these vivid characters in his prologue with artistry. He pictures the prioress as demure and neat and cultured. There are poetic shafts aimed at the monk who in this case was not pale and studious, but worldly and well fed. For show and sham and abuses of religion, the poet reveals little patience. His ire flames especially at the pardoner who went about selling indulgences, preying upon the poor and rich alike. For the poor parson, however, he has nothing but praise. \"Riche he was in holy thought and work,\" says the poet; and further:\nHe wayted after pomp and reverence, Ne (not) maked him a spiced conscience, But Cristes lore,\" and his gospels twelve, He taught, and first he folwed it him selve.\n\"Meaning the gospel of Christ.\nBecause of the old-time language, which, after all, is mainly what we use today, only with some letters spelled differently, many folk miss the enjoyment of Chaucer. For those who do get over the not very difficult word barrier, there are delightful descriptions, touches of humor, bits of wisdom and gospel truths, as well as charming stories in his writings. He pictures for us typically human folk of not only his own day, but of all time. Throughout the work of this pioneer in English narrative poetry, the helpful influence of the Bible is plainly shown. Another of our great poets who drew from the Bible not only inspiration but divine themes for his masterpieces was John Milton. In him, as in Chaucer, we can see three major influences blended to help bring forth masterly creations. First, the freedom-demanding spirit of the Anglo-Saxon; second, the culture of classic Greece; third, the Bible, with its teachings of God and the gospel of Jesus Christ. For a helpful comparison here, think of the soil-laden waters of the Missouri as typifying the rugged northland folk; the clearer Mississippi as the more artistic Hellenes; and the \"Beautiful Ohio\" as the spiritualizing Hebraic and Christian contribution? all flowing together to make one great stream. In Paradise Lost, to apply this analogy, we have an excellent example of such a blended creation. Milton was trained in Anglo-Saxon love of freedom; he was a classical scholar, a devoted student of the scriptures. As secretary of Oliver Cromwell, he naturally was stirred to the depths by the arrogant assumption of King Charles the First, that kings had \"divine right\" to rule. To the poet this all had its prototype in the \"War in Heaven\" with Satan, father of tyrants, fighting to dominate the souls of men, and Christ leading the host battling to uphold man's right to exercise his God-given free agency. Here was a Bible-inspired theme, vital then and always. How could it be most splendidly expressed? All the artistry of poetry Milton had gained from his classic studies was brought into play. Paradise Lost most sublime of epics, vibrates with the spirit of liberty; it is stately in form, portraying heavenly characters, Satan and his legions in hell, the Son of God and his divine mission, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, their temptation by the Devil, their fall, and expulsion from Paradise. Ringing lines of truth, precious descriptions, vivid moving pictures, all in the spirit of Job and Isaiah and the Apocalypse of John, bring this epic up to the world's greatest of literary creations. To feel its spiritual powers, its music and beauty, one must hear it effectively voiced. Further, it must be read and reread if the inner meaning of the poem is to be appreciated. Paradise Lost will yield its rare wealth only to those who are willing to pay the price of earnest study. Such effort, like that applied to the mastery of classic music, brings its rich and lasting rewards. Just a few lines can be given here to suggest some of the gems of thought and description within the great epic: Him (Satan) th' Almighty Power Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky. The mind is its own place, and in itself Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven?-so says the fallen Satan. LESSON DEPARTMENT When the Son of God offers himself to redeem the world, his Father, with tender love and admiration, makes promise that through this atoning sacrifice shall come, in time, New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. And after all their tribulations long. See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds. With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. Matchless portrayal of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, of the subtleties of Satan, and of the driving of our first parents from Paradise, carry forward the great story to its closing lines: Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon; The world was all before them, where to choose Their place of rest, and Providence their guide. They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, Through Eden took their solitary way. The Canterbury Tales and Paradise Lost differ basically in form. Stories that Chaucer brings together in the first are individual, unrelated tales. It is only the outward plan, devised by the poet, of having the various pilgrims traveling together tell the different stories that holds them with something of unity. Paradise Lost, on the other hand, is made up of different stories, each of which helps to develop the central theme. This makes it an epic, similar to the Illiad, the Odyssey or to Hiawatha. The Canterbury Tales, in structure may be likened to a necklace; Paradise Lost is more wheel-like in its story unity. Idylls of the King by Tennyson is another great epic. Its various interesting stories of the Knights of the Round Table center in Arthur, their king. In Celtic tales this legendary hero was preserved through the years. In Mallory's Morte d'Arthur, one of the first of English books to be printed, stories linked with Arthur's name are in prose. Tennyson brings to us many of the same stories in more polished English blank (unrhymed) verse. Further, the poet portrays King Arthur more plainly as a champion of Christianity. With his chosen and tested knights, he strives to hold back the Anglo-Saxon pagans who, when the Roman legions were withdrawn from England, made conquest of that realm. With \"We fight for our fair father Christ,\" as something of a battle cry, the courageous Arthur: Fought, and in twelve great battles overcame The heathen hordes, and made a realm and reigned. At the outset the King had announced: \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new.\" Something more, however, than victory over pagan hosts was necessary to make good that vow. Stories, one after another, of the Knights of the Table Round, reveal the continuing struggle against sin, disloyalty to high ideals, and a falling from grace. Then into the epic comes the miracle of the Holy Grail. This sacred symbol, one legend has it, was the cup out of which Christ drank at his Last Supper. Taken to England, so the old story goes, by Joseph of Arimathea, it had remained there until the time-Grew such evil that the holy cup Was caught away to heaven and disappeared. Only by the absolutely pure could the cup again be seen. A sister of Sir Percival, of the Table Round, was first to win that precious privilege. 632 Said she: Sweet brother, I have seen the Holy Grail: For waked at dead of night, I heard a sound As of a silver horn from o'er the hills... And then Streamed through my cell a cold and silver beam. And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail. Rose red \"with beatings on it, as if alive... And then the music faded, and the Grail Pass'd.... So now the Holy Thing is here again Among us, brother, fast thou too and pray, And tell thy brother knights to fast and pray, That so perchance the vision may be seen By thee and those and all the world be heal'd. Percival, heeding his sister's words, withdrew from the Table Round to an abbey, to pass his life thenceforth in prayer and fast and alms. Other knights, catching the religious fervor, likewise took up the quest of the Holy Grail. Among them was Galahad, youngest of all. To this splendid youth, King Arthur, dubbing him knight, had said, \"God make thee as pure as thou art beautiful.\" That tiie prayer was granted is attested by the story that Galahad was one who did see the vision of the Holy Grail. But unrighteousness did not cease. The Table Round in time was broken up. At last came the passing of the king (Morte d'Ar-thur).And, as the great leader neared the close of his uplifting life, he said again: The old order changeth, yielding place to new?Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of Outstanding among our American creators of narrative and epic poetry is Longfellow. His name, to most folk, will bring memories of Evangeline and The Courtship oi Miles Standish. Something deeper than just interesting stories are in these and other narrative verse by Longfellow. Evangeline is a symphony impressing \"the beauty and strength of woman's devotion\"; The Courtship oi Miles Standish likewise is a musically beautiful poem portraying conflict between love and duty. Both picture with artistry moving scenes in earlier American life: one a story of the Norman peasantry transplanted to Arcadia; the other a story of the Pilgrims in Plymouth. To get the full richness out of these classics, one must read and reread them and, in doing so, follow Longfellow's own advice from \"The Day is Done\": Lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty of thy voice. All great poetry was created to be heard rather than just to be read silently. Another thing: to appreciate the inner meaning and spiritual beauty of these story-poems one must know the Bible. All through them are lines that call, as do the following, for a working knowledge of that Book of Books. These are typical ones from Evangeline: Harvests were gathered in; and wild, with the winds of September Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel. Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's Desolate seashore. Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock with the self-same Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter. Hot and on his lips still burned the flush of the fever As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had besprinkled its portals. LESSON DEPARTMENT 633 That the angel of death might see the sign and pass over. And these from The Courtship of Miles Standish: This is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger, For I have followed too much the heart's desires and devices, Worshipping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal. This is the cross I must bear, the sin and the swift retribution. Giants in hearts they were, who believed in God and the Bible, Ay, who believed in the smiting of Midianites and Philistines. Forth from the curtain of clouds, from the tent of purple and scarlet. Issued the sun, the great High Priest, in his garments resplendent. Holiness unto the Lord, in letters of light on his forehead. Another of Longfellow's creations, in structure like that of the Canterbury Tales and doubtless inspired by Chaucer's creation, is Tales of A Wayside Inn. In his later years, the American poet, as professor of the chair of poetry at Harvard, gathered round him friends and students from not only his own but other countries. Go to the Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts? preserved now as a shrine by Henry Ford, in tribute to Longfellow's work which gave the place literary immortality?and you may see photographs of some of these friends hanging on the wall. There, as the poet devised the setting for his tales, the group of friends would gather round the fireside, and share their stories. From the genial landlord, they were given the first one, \"Paul Revere's Ride.\" Another, \"King Robert of Sicily\" came from a Sicilian; still another, already mentioned in the first of our lessons \"The Saga of King Olaf\" was related by the musician, Ole Bull. A Spanish Jew, a poet, a theologian, and a student, all add their favorite tales. And these, with prelude and interludes, are held together as with a strand?story gems made into a literary necklace. Many of the stories are closely linked with the Bible. This is true especially of \"King Robert of Sicily,\" \"The Legend Beautiful,\" and the \"Legend of Rabbi Ben Levi.\" Others, like \"The Birds of Killingworth\" vibrate with the Christian spirit. And this may be said not only of Longfellow's poems as a whole, but of story-poems created by Whittier, Lowell, and other fine American poets. Space forbids more than this passing tribute due these creators of interesting, uplifting literature. Discussion and Activities 1. (a) What, in brief, does Chaucer portray in The Canterbury Tales?

Christensen For Tuesday, January 29, 1946 Lesson link: Drug addiction, alcoholism, gambling, unchastity, and other moral problems of personal conduct were analyzed last time. Causes and consequences in each of these areas of defiant behavior were emphasized, and it was shown that the effects of private immorality reach much farther than the offending persons themselves. Repentance was given as the way out. Lesson aim: To demonstrate a relationship between modes of recreation and morality, and to suggest ways for improving the morals of society by making better use of leisure time. MAN has not always enjoyed the leisure that he knows today. There was a time, not so long ago, when recreational activities were largely reserved for the privileged upper classes, and the common man was required to toil from dawn until dusk. But all of this has now been changed. No longer is there a special leisure class monopolizing both idleness and opportunity; instead, today, every class is a leisure class. In a remarkably short period of time the machine age has cut the working day in half, releasing, thereby, many surplus man hours for leisure-time activities. And the end is not yet. It is not at all improbable that technological progress in the future will reduce the working day to four or five hours, thus assuring the average man a large amount of leisure time.\nBut time is a responsibility as well as an opportunity, and, where improperly used, may prove to be a liability rather than an asset. Most people who get into trouble seem to do so in their spare time. The statement, \"Idleness is the devil's workshop,\" is as true today as when it was first uttered, and yet there is more time for idleness now than ever before. Personal debaucheries, such as those discussed in the previous lesson, are in many cases the direct result of the dissipation of leisure time.\nRecreation for Profit\nLiterally the term recreation means to revive, refresh or create anew; in other words, to \"re-create.\" Actually, judging by the dissipation and immorality frequently carried on under its name, it could sometimes better be spelled \"wreckreation\" with emphasis on the \"wreck.\" Leisure time is potentially a blessing, giving opportunity for rest, hobby activities, sports, social life, cultural developments, and artistic expressions; but it is often wasted or used unwisely, wrecking both health and character, and leaving misery in its wake.\nThe major reason for this perversion of leisure-time opportunity is the profit motive. Business interests, seeing the great increase of leisure that has taken place in the modern world, have capitalized upon the situation for the sake of private profit. It used to be that practically all recreational activities were in the home or other primary groups, were largely spontaneous, and were free. Now, however, there is an all-too-common feeling that to have any fun one must go out of the home and spend money for recreation. When the desire for profit comes in conflict with the welfare of the public it usually suffers, which explains the reason for so much of the corrupt in our leisure-time activities. With a few exceptions, commercialized recreation is concerned with profit rather than morals, and it is this disregard for the best interests of the public that accounts for so many of its lurid appeals and unfortunate influences.\nThen, too, commercialized recreation is so often of the passive variety that, aside from any directly unwholesome influence it may have, it fails to restore or revive, and it may even actually fatigue or destroy the personality. We are too frequently spectators and too infrequently participants in leisure-time activities to get the most out of them. It is better to be an active player than a passive watcher or listener; to be really effective, recreation must be active and creative.\nAnother unfortunate tendency accompanying the profit motive in commercialized recreation is the development and acceptance of the \"thrill\" psychology. Thrills and super-thrills seem to characterize the spirit of the times. The real danger in this, of course, lies in the fact that continual thrills of the physical and sensuous type tend to blunt the finer sensitivities of man, blinding him to the deeper spiritual joys of life, and causing him to feel that he must not stop until he has tried everything. And, in such a frame of mind, when the \"giant racer\" variety of thrill no longer satisfies, he will sometimes seek for bigger thrills in robbery, sex crimes, etc.\nThe Picture Show\nIt has been estimated that at least one hundred million people attend Here is the OCR-corrected transcription of the excerpt:\nthe movies each week in this country, and that about twenty-eight million of these are minors. Since the picture show has such a widespread appeal as this, it might be well to inquire into its possible influence upon moral behavior.\nThere have been a number of studies dealing with the relationship between movie attendance and moral conduct, and they all point to the same general conclusion; namely, that movies are frequently a stimulus to delinquent conduct, particularly with youth.\nThe picture show is able to effectively dramatize and glamorize different modes of life to make them appealing. As a result, Hollywood sets the styles in mannerisms and morals as well as in clothes. Children and adolescents, because of their immaturity, are especially impressionable and susceptible to influence. In pictures dealing with crime the bad man usually gets caught, it is true, and the implication is usually left that \"crime does not pay\"; but to the adolescent the criminal's glamorous life is often more vivid and thrilling than is the somewhat dry fact that he pays in the end. Love and sex themes frequently arouse the romantic and sexual emotions and condition the attitudes of youngsters, with sexual experimentation and promiscuity as the result. Many a juvenile delinquent, and no few number of adults, have testified that they got their start in crime from the movies.\nAll of this raises the question of control, and there are essentially three points at which control might take place; (1) In production centers. The Will Hays office of censorship in Hollywood is successful in eliminating many of the objectionable features of each play, but it needs to go farther. The Catholic Legion of Decency, and other similar pressure groups, though smaller, have succeeded in wielding some desirable influence on movie producers, but they are too limited in their scope and power. There is need for a united movement on the part of all the public to demand that better shows be produced. (2) In the community. Some states and a few local communities have censorship laws to control the type of shows allowed to come in, but in most places the market is open to anything that will bring profit to the company regardless of whether it is good or bad from the standpoint of the community. Citizens need to develop a community consciousness to the extent that they will tolerate only the better pictures to be shown. (3) In the home. Fortunately, no one is compelled to see a movie just because it is shown in the community. But there are too many families that seemingly don't care where their members spend their time; too many parents who are indifferent to their children's absence or who may even send them to a show (without first informing themselves as to the kind of show) in order to get them out of the way. Movies of the right sort can be valuable aids in character building, but there are too many of the wrong sort and too many parents who either don't know or don't care. Of such is immorality bred.\nThe Public Dance Hall\nDancing itself is innocent enough, but the conditions and temptations surrounding the average public dance hall of the day are enough to\nmake of it a real moral problem. LESSON DEPARTMENT 637 Men and women of all ages come together without chaperonage and usually in search of a thrill. Many are unescorted. The hardened and depraved rub elbows with the innocent and adventurous. Lights are dimmed. The orchestra plays softly and romantically. Liquor is brought and passed around. ?Pickups\" are made for the rendezvous after the dance. Regrets and despair too often await the dawn. Some may think that this picture of the public dance hall is painted overly dark; but if it is, it is only for the sake of emphasis. All that is said here is true, and while it must be recognized that many can attend the public dance and remain unharmed, yet it must also be admitted that many others cannot; and therein lies the danger. If liquor, unescorted attendance, and pickups could be eliminated from the public dance hall, it would be far more acceptable from the moral point of view. Parents and community workers should insist upon these reforms, but in the meantime they should strive to keep their children free from all such dangerous, immoral exposures. Miscellaneous Decreative Patterns Although the picture show and the public dance were singled out for special analysis, it should be remembered that there are a great many other patterns of \"recreation-al\" behavior that are decreative or demoralizing in their results. And some of these are even more destructive than the two mentioned above. Thriller radio programs, comics, and pulp magazines all join with the movies in furnishing morbid and distorted stimulation to the young. It might be just about as logical to speak of \"our radio-made children\" or \"our comic-made children\" as it is to speak of \"our movie-made children,\" for in each case the effect of continuous exposure upon attitudes and behavior is rather profound. Overstimulation and overexcitement with emphasis upon the brutal and the gruesome is characteristic of a proportion of them all. It is even difficult to understand why the so-called comic magazines are spoken of as comics at all. As for the dime novel and the pulp magazine, the slant is so definitely toward sex, erotic love, and cheap adventure as to be revolting to all mature persons. But youth are not mature, and to permit them to be exposed to some of this vicious literature is a moral crime of considerable magnitude. The night club, the cabaret, the roadhouse, the pool hall, the \"beer joint,\" the gambling den, the taxi dance hall, and the burlesque or \"girl\" show, are a few other types of leisure-time activities that frequently lead to extreme personal and social disorganization. Alcohol and sex used for profit, either singly or together, create very dangerous situations, regardless of the name of the institution used as a shield. Often, too, the problem is primarily one of sheer idleness, starting in boredom and ending in mischief. Personal disorganization resulting from the misuse of leisure time is not restricted to the big city with its high-powered temptations and its opportunities for anonymity. The small town is frequently just as much to blame, and this for the very reason that it fails to provide wholesome and challenging activities and interests. But, whatever the community, idleness when permitted to exist creates real moral problems. Loitering on the streets, \"killing time\" in the pool halls, and seeking thrills in the back alleys, all start with idleness and end with trouble. Leisure Time and the Community The blessing of abundant leisure time, which has come to man and which will increase all the more in the future, carries with it a great moral responsibility. That responsibility is to use this extra time well, to let it be the means of lifting man up to the better and nobler things of life. When dissipated, leisure time leads to both idleness and debauchery, examples of which we have seen throughout this lesson. When utilized in line with moral principles, it leads to richer experiences, deeper appreciations, and loftier satisfactions. Our job is to eliminate the waste and the wreckage of leisure, and to put in their place the finer and more wholesome things of life. Students of crime and delinquency frequently point to the lack of adequate cultural and recreational facilities in the community as a major factor in immoral and anti-social conduct. This is especially true with reference to the young. With time on their hands and the desire for fun, young people often find themselves faced with the limited alternatives of loitering on the streets or participating in some relatively unwholesome commercialized, leisure-time offering. No wonder so many of them get into trouble. It is high time that more of our communities awaken to the problem, as some are now doing, and provide decent places and programs for the enjoyment and development of the young during their leisure hours. Recreational centers should be developed, appealing cultural programs should be offered, ct cetera. Schools, churches, service clubs, and other groups can give valuable assistance to such a movement by talking it up, offering their facilities for the various activities, and by manifesting their willingness to co-operate in the larger, integrated community program. There is much that can be done on a community basis to check delinquency and develop morality in the young. Latent resources that could be utilized to combat these evil influences are abundant in every community. But to accomplish this, as it should be accomplished, will require the interest and united effort of all. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Explain how the great increase of leisure time has been possible. Why does leisure time, sometimes prove to be a liability rather than an asset? Give examples. Do you agree that most people who get into trouble do so in their spare time? Explain. 2. How does the profit motive lead to corruption in recreational activities? Give examples. Why has the increase in commercialized recreation paralleled the increase in leisure time? Is commercialized recreation always \"wreckreation?\" Defend your point of view. What is spectatoritis? Is it good or bad? Discuss. 3. Why are picture shows so influential in the shaping of attitudes and conduct? Show how movies have contributed to delinquency (as a basis for this the class leader may want to have someone give a brief review of Forman's Our LESSON DEPARTMENT 639 Movie Made Children). Select one or two recent picture shows that most of the class would have seen and criticize as to good and bad features. How can the quality of pictures produced and coming into the community be controlled? What is the particular responsibility of parents regarding movie attendance? Suggest ways and means of selecting the better pictures and of directing the attendance of children. Describe the major evils attending the average public dance hall, and explain why each is an evil. Is dancing itself an evil? Why not? Can you suggest any ways of eliminating the evils of the dance without eliminating dancing itself? Show how certain radio programs, comics, and magazine materials are unwholesome. If possible, ask class members ahead of time to listen to certain radio programs for children. Criticize these programs in class. Bring selected comics and pulp magazines to class as a basis for discussion. Describe other disorganizing leisure-time activities that may be in your community. 6. Why does leisure time. Carry with it a moral responsibility? Discuss ways that your community might organize for a better use of leisure time, and show how individuals and groups can help. Could the Relief Society do anything about this problem? Discuss. 7. Why is the Family Hour program, recommended by the Church, so influential in shaping attitudes and conduct?

Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy (Psalms 107:1-2). RECENTLY, I stood with hundreds of others at a service marking the end of war. Against a sky tinted with the last debate shades of sunset, with one star glistening like a symbol of hope above a back-drop of majestic mountains, I saw the American flag hoisted high upon a flagpole. I watched it flutter... Clean and bright and beautiful beyond utterance above me. I heard the band play \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" and I felt a thrill throughout my entire being. I felt pride and gratitude and humility. I thought of free men all over the world who were witnessing a similar scene and feeling hope reborn within them. I thought how indescribably horrible it must have been for our boys to see that beautiful flag lowered to the dust while an enemy flag took its place. I thought of the prophetic words, '1 shall return,\" and their triumphant fulfillment. Then I thought of the boys who had given their lives. Some of them I had known since they were small boys with great dreams in their eyes, with great promise in the future. And even as my heart ached for them and for their parents and wives and sweethearts, I felt that could they see the flag as I saw it now, could they hear the band playing, they would feel that it had not been in vain. Most of all, I thought that never should a people have been more humble, more prayerful, more grateful than the people of America should be today. Never should we have felt more to bend the knee and bow the head in thanks and praise, than in this hour of victory and peace. For the terror of the past years is ended, the guns of war have ceased, men are turning again to their plowshares and their normal pursuits. We stand a free people, we stand still a nation victorious, a light unto the whole world, a beacon to peace and good-will. Thanks be to God. Yes, we have done great things, we have preserved liberty as a hope for all the oppressed and downtrodden people everywhere, we have proven that right is more powerful than might. We have come a 'heartthrob nearer to the end of wars.' Surely, no one can doubt the destiny, the supreme power, that has seen us through our dark days. Surely, no one can be too proud, too ungrateful, to kneel and give thanks for the preservation of his home and his God-given rights of freedom and justice, as well as for the gift of life for loved ones, for the future that lies ahead, even as the Pilgrim fathers before us offered thanks for their crops, for their preservation, for the land that had been a refuge. Page  Actually, we are not so different today. After their waiting and anxiety, after their travail and fear, they saw their crops ripen to abundance, saw the fruition of their hopes. They knew that God had seen fit to bless them. For, with all our scientific knowledge, with all our physical and mental accomplishments, how helpless we are, really, with all our learning, how frightened and alone in the presence of death or illness or the unloosed elements. How in need of the humble faith that looks upward and trusts, and gives thanks. Yes, giving thanks is an integral part of prayer. Christ thanked his Father in heaven for manifest blessings. He walked among men with implicit and utter trust. What father could turn a deaf ear to this? And what child is not better and worthier for having the grace of gratitude, for gratefully saying \"Thank you,\" for a favor requested or granted. Many thinkers believe the secret of the miracles Christ was able to perform was his unerring trust in the Eternal Father. He gave praise and thanks, and he had implicit faith; he never for a moment doubted the power of God to do that which was asked in sincerity and tri4st. A person without gratitude is like a tree that is barren of fruit, that receives' bounteously, yet lacks the grace to give of itself in return. There were miracles in this war, many of them; there were strong men who had boasted of their unbelief brought to their knees when they were overcome by adversity beyond human help. We all know of those shipwrecked, thirsting and hungering men who literally saw manna come out of heaven, who saw the sky respond to their need of water when they could bear their thirst no longer. We all know of those miraculously saved in fox-holes, in the air, on the sea. These men were forced to their knees in humility, they came back different men, men purified by prayer and by thanksgiving. We, as individuals, as a nation, as a world, need the purification of these two things: prayer and thanksgiving. So, let us lift up our hearts, let us humble our spirits and be contrite and prayerful, let us thank our Father in heaven that we have been preserved, that we have been given another chance to make a good and a godly world, to find lasting peace, to do away with want and prejudice of race or creed, to live as brothers in the beautiful and bounteous world he has given us. In this time of rich harvest, this time of reunion, of happy homecoming, this time of serious meditation on man's dependence on a higher power, this time of gratefulness for a belief in a life after death, of immortality and eternal progression for those who have so nobly given their lives, let us humbly say. Thanks be to God. Thanks... Be... To God! Be"

            "content": "Excerpts from the Idaho Falls Temple Dedicatory Prayer President George Albert Smith r\\ thou great and eternal God, Father of our spirits, Creator of the heavens, the earth and all things therein; before whom all things are present, whether past or yet to come; full of mercy and love, guided by wisdom, judgment, and justice in their perfection; in humility and with thanksgiving and with our hearts filled with gratitude unto thee, we approach thee through thy Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, our Elder Brother, who, through the great and exquisite sacrifice wrought out for us, magnanimous beyond our comprehension, made it possible that we might approach thee in humility on this great occasion, with our petitions and supplications, in this House which we have built to thy most holy name. We pray thee that thou wilt cause our hearts to be purified in thy sight and our faith in thee to be multiplied and increased so that our petitions may reach thy holy habitation and be answered in our behalf in accordance with thy infinite wisdom and love, and grant that the blessings we here seek may be fully realized to thy name's honor and glory. We thank thee for having raised up thy servant, Joseph Smith, and that thou didst endow him and inspire him and reveal unto him thy great purposes, and that thou didst manifest thyself and thy Beloved Son unto him, and didst cause holy resurrected beings to minister unto him and to confer upon him the Holy Priesthood after the order of thine Only Begotten Son, and its appendage, the Aaronic Priesthood. We are grateful unto thee for those who now preside over thy Church. We pray that thy servant, George Albert Smith, may be endowed of thee with a vigorous body and mind, with health and strength, and with the spirit of prophecy, seership, revelation and of presidency, and with the ability to magnify thy great and holy name. Bless his faithful counselors, Joshua Reuben Clark, Jr. And David Oman McKay, whom thou hast given to advise him and assist him, that they may possess great wisdom and excellent judgment in all matters pertaining to thy Church. Grant that perfect love and confidence may exist in this thy Presidency that they may be united as one in all things pertaining to thy work. Page 645 Confer upon thy people, and especially upon thy leaders, in all of their various callings, thy precious gifts of love, wisdom, and judgment, knowledge and understanding, faith and the spirit of testimony, light, intelligence and capacity, and every attribute, blessing, gift and qualification either necessary or desirable for them to have and enjoy in order that thy great and important work may go forward to consummate its glorious purpose. Father, wilt thou preserve thy saints in the unity of the faith, in the way of truth, in the bonds of peace, and holiness of life. We pray for the daughters of Zion. May they be preserved in virtue, chastity and purity of life, be blessed with vigorous bodies and minds, and with great faith. May they develop into true womanhood and receive choice companions under the new and everlasting covenant for time and for all eternity in thy temples provided for this priceless privilege and purpose. May they too be privileged to enjoy as the fruits of their union a noble posterity which, we pray thee, may be taught at their mother's knee to believe in thee and in the divine mission of thy Beloved Son. We thank thee, O our Father, that thou didst restore that grand and glorious principle of marriage for eternity, and didst bestow upon thy servant the power to seal on earth and have it recognized in the heavens. We acknowledge this privilege as one of thy most marvelous gifts to us. May all the youth of thy Church come to know of its beauty and of its eternal importance to them, and to take advantage of it when they marry. May they, our Father, on the other hand, realize fully that the glorious opportunity for eternal companionship of husband and wife, and the power of eternal increase, may be forfeited by them if they fail, through negligence or indifference, to conform to thy requirements, or if having taken advantage thereof, they may still, through improper conduct, lose their blessings. Wilt thou, O Father in heaven, remember the Relief Society throughout the length and the breadth of the Church. May those who engage therein, either as officers or teachers, be abundantly rewarded for their unselfish sacrifices, for the services they render, for their acts of mercy and kindness, and for their ministrations to the sick, the needy, and the unfortunate. We pray thee that in their homes and in their responsibilities they may enjoy the rich companionship of thy Holy Spirit. With deep gratitude in our hearts we thank thee that the nations have ceased their warfare and the destruction of human life. We thank thee, O God, for the choice land upon which we reside, and for the marvelous promises thou hast made concerning America, that it should be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under Heaven so long as the inhabitants of the land should worship the God of the land who is Jesus Christ."

            "content": "Remembering the Birthday of President Grant THIS November, President Grant would have been eighty-nine years old had his life been spared a few months longer. Members of the Church and a multitude of friends, all over the world will remember President Grant's birthday with gratitude and thanksgiving, appreciating the faithful and inspired service he rendered, his love and kindness that reached beyond his family, beyond his Church, and to an ever-widening circle of friends and associates. Among the hundreds of letters which poured into the homes of President Grant's family, following his demise, there are none which exhibit more reverence for him and more understanding of his true greatness than those written by his grandsons in the armed forces. Excerpts from some of these letters follow: PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT Page 647 In Italy, these words were penned to Sister Grant: I'm sure that Grandfather was a great man. His calling as God's servant was evidence that he was one of the Lord's choicest children. I'm thankful tonight for my noble heritage. I'm thankful for having known and loved my Grandfather. I'm thankful for his testimony of the gospel because it has helped me to understand life and the part I should play in it. Many times a person who has achieved greatness is misunderstood and his personal life is very often one of trouble and unhappiness. But such was not the case with Grandfather. One of the greatest joys he experienced was the love and understanding which you and his children have shown him. You created a home, and though sometimes it was in foreign places, it was ever a haven of love and peace where he could come. From Germany, another grandson wrote: It is hard to express one's thoughts at this time. They are intermixed with memories of the greatness and goodness of Grandfather's life and the knowledge that he is now released from a burden which he carried so cheerfully during his last years. Knowing this, we have little cause to mourn. We can only express our gratitude for the wonderful influence he had on our lives and the secure knowledge we have that we will be with him again. An expression written in Panama reads: I have relived a great many of the moments I was privileged to spend in the presence of this truly great man, and in so doing I have been awed at how richly endowed he was with character and personality and a fine zest for living. The greatest lesson he leaves for me is in his unquenchable spirit. My fondest memories of him will be of the times when we drove in the mountains with the top down on the car while he sang with a gusto which came from his deep and abiding love for the natural works of God. All of us whose lives have been touched by his owe him a debt which can be paid only in emulation. In Austria, another grandson had this to say: It is comforting to know that on the other side of the veil the joy of Grandfather's coming back and the joy of those welcoming him back far surpasses the sorrow of those who are left behind and who must part with the one they love. I feel so distant and far away to try to help at a time like this. However, there is always one thing that I can do and that is to go on living so that I may merit what has been given me and, in so 4oing, bring happiness to those who have given me so much. In Newfoundland, these words were penned (again to Sister Grant): I have always been proud that I have known both you and Grandfather. Your perfect family life, your cheerfulness, your generosity, your high standards in everything, make me humble indeed in your presence.... Please remember that I am one of the thousands who loved Grandfather and remember, also, that I love you. Space will not permit an inclusion of more excerpts from these letters, except for one which strikes the keynote of President Grant's greatness, for, after all, it was the gospel which made him great. This letter was written by a grandson in the United States: I have never been able to express how proud and humble I have always felt about having him for a grandfather. If I do my best all my life, I wonder if I'll be worthy of the heritage I have,... Thank God for the gospel of Jesus Christ and the absolute realization it brings that we shall see our beloved Grandfather again."

            "content": "Dinner at Nora's Martha. Robeson Wiight BUT I'm not taking no for an answer,  Maddy  Nora said over the phone. \"Ross and I have planned on this Thanksgiving dinner with you and Bruce as usual, and we have the turkey and all the trimmings ready to cook.\"  I told you I was sorry.\" Madeline couldn't help it if her voice was listless. Tt isn't any use.\" Nora made no attempt this time to be diplomatic. \"Maddy Pearson, I'm your oldest, and I think your best friend. You're being selfish. Your staying home and refusing to eat isn't helping Tommy any. He wouldn't want you to be that way. And what about Bruce? He might enjoy coming.\" Madeline closed her brown eyes for a moment and shuddered. \"You couldn't possibly understand, Nora,\" she said wearily, patiently, \"I couldn't stand it all of that food on the table. The smell of it... When...\" \"I understand more than you think,\" Nora Blake said bluntly, \"And I'm still expecting you and Bruce over here for dinner tomorrow.\" For a second Madeline wanted to scream at her. But she didn't. She hadn't been able to cry since word had come of Tommy's death. She'd tried it. There was pain, tightness, despair. Nora didn't know all of that, and there was no use trying to explain it to her. Instead, she said, \"All right, Nora, we'll come. But don't expect me to eat anything. M-my stomach couldn't take it.\" \"Bring your bottle of milk along, then,\" Nora ordered, \"but I want you to be over here tomorrow with Bruce, or or I'll never speak to you again as long as we live,\" she finished quickly, and hung up. Madeline gasped and placed the receiver on the hook. As long as we live, she thought, as she turned from the phone. That didn't mean a thing. There's nothing to live for now... With Tommy gone.... Bruce was watching her from his easy chair by the radio. Tommy's tragic death didn't seem to affect him as much as it had her. He went about his business with the same cheerfulness as before. His gray eyes were a little less twinkling and his hair had threads of silver, but he seemed the same. Of course, no one could understand how a mother would feel. \"That Nora again?\" Bruce asked. Madeline nodded and pushed back a strand of brown hair. \"She seems to have lost well, all sensitivity of feeling. You'd think she'd try to understand how I feel.\" Bruce shook his head slowly. \"But she's right, you know. And we've had Thanksgiving dinner with her and Ross for twenty years... Since the first year their Jim and our Tommy were born.\" Madeline winced and her lips curled themselves in a grimace. \"You, too?\" How could he know the pain inside her heart... Almost unbearable at times? \"All people Page  think about is eating... Eating... Filling themselves with rich food...\" Bruce got up and began to pace back and forth in the room. \"You ve got to face this thing out, Maddy/' he said kindly, \"Going without food won't bring Tommy back. Going without food wouldn't have helped him when he was alive in that prison camp, slowly starving to death.\" She turned on him, fists clenched, mouth contorted. '1 was the first to give him food. I taught him how to eat with a spoon then a fork-how to feed himself. But I couldn't help in that prison camp. I wouldn't have minded so much his dying in battle... That's a kinder way... A quicker way. I see him... Every night... Lying there... Suffering... And thinking of the good food he always had at home. He loved my cooking... I know he must have thought of that... To the very end!\" B RUCE stopped pacing and the look he gave her was strange. Almost as if he felt that she was to blame for everything that had happened. \"Other mothers have lost their sons, Maddy.\" She forced herself to look at him intently. \"Other mothers? Did their sons die in prison camps?\" She caught her breath in a dry sob. Bruce came over and took her hands. \"Everything will iron itself out, Maddy, if you'll try. Thanks for telling Nora you'd go. It won't be so bad. We have to learn to start mingling with people.\" Nora and Ross opened the door and helped them off with their coats. \"Sure swell, seeing you folks,\" Ross said. \"You look well, Maddy. The cold's put roses in your cheeks.\" \"On her nose, too,\" Bruce said, grinning. Madeline shivered, but it wasn't from the cold. How could they be so callous? How could they joke like that when they knew that never again would Tommy be able to spend a Thanksgiving with them. \"Come on in the living room,\" Nora said cheerfully. \"We have two other guests I'd like you to meet.\" Madeline's heart contracted with pain. \"Nora, I can't stay, now. I couldn't meet strangers.\" Ross took a firm hold on her arm. \"Oh, yes you can, Madeline. We hadn't intended having anyone else but us, but these kids needed a home on this day of days. We'd have been heels not to have them here, too.\" \"I want you to meet Sergeant Brent Sherwood, and Corporal Bill Benning,\" Ross said, guiding her to the young men. \"Don't get up boys,\" he added quickly, at their indication of rising. \"These boys have been in the hospital,\" he explained to Madeline. She felt that all the discordant sounds in the world had come into the room and were dinning in her ears. Her head was heavy and her eyes felt out of focus. These young men in uniform became a conglomeration of blurred features; and somehow Tommy's face became mixed in with theirs. She couldn't speak. She wet her lips and tried to keep the terrible pain from making her faint. As from a distance, she heard Ross saying, \"Mrs. Pearson hasn't been well for several months, and the difference between DINNER AT NORA'S 651 the cold outside and this warm room has been a httle upsetting.\" She allowed herself to be led to a chair. She didn't dare look at the young men, who had so courteously acknowledged the introduction. She would have to try to convince Nora that she was too ill to remain if Nora would just come near enough to speak to. But Nora had disappeared into the kitchen. The young men chattered with Bruce and Ross, and through the fog of her grief, Madeline heard them laughing and joking. How could those soldiers laugh and joke like that? Didn't they ever remember the boys who hadn't come back? They were here in this room, whole, hearty, and happy. Gradually, the haze around her cleared and she leaned back against her chair. Nora meant well, and she was fond of her. But Nora's son, Jimmy, pal of Tommy, was still safe, and was coming home soon. Nora came bustling in from the dining room, eyes sparkling, cheeks flushed. \"Dinner is served,\" she said. Ross came over to help Madeline to her feet. Nora went over to the boys. \"I intend to have two gentlemen lead me to my table,\" she said, beaming up at them. She could beam, thought Madeline bitterly. She hasn't lost her son. The taller. Sergeant Sherwood, picked up a cane from beside his chair. Madeline was startled. She hadn't noticed the cane before. It had been lying on the side she couldn't see. \"You'll have to wait until I get Bill here up on his new feet,\" he said grinning. \"The guy's all right once he gets on them, but he's only had them two weeks.\" To her astonishment and inward horror. Sergeant Sherwood tapped his own right leg with his cane, \"My old wooden leg makes me awkward without my cane. It's new, too. But Bill here doesn't need a cane, the lucky bloke, once he gets standing.\" MADELINE couldn't move, but sat fascinated, while Sergeant Sherwood helped Corporal Benning up from the chair... Or tried to. It was evident that Bill was deliberately teasing and trying to make the process more difficult than it really was. With exaggerated grimaces and clowning, with pithy comments, he finally sighed and groaned. \"Can't make it. Brent, old man. Guess I'd better go back to the old cash and carry system.\" Brent Sherwood, almost double with laughter, gave one last heave and pulled Bill Benning to his feet. For a long moment Bill stood there, swaying uncertainly, as a doll does when it has been set on its feet not quite on the straight. Then he gave himself a tiny hitch, and held out his arm gallantly to Nora, and said, \"Madam, will you honor me? Old Brent here has all he can do to manage his cane.\" And Nora, laughing up at him, said, \"I am indeed honored. Corporal.\" They led the way to the dining table, Bill taking careful strides on his new feet. Madeline finally managed to extricate herself from, her chair, clutched Ross's arm and followed, with Sergeant Sherwood and Bruce bringing up the rear. There they sat, around the beautifully decorated table, the immense brown turkey glistening on its silver platter, candlelight throwing a soft glow over all. The two boys made twelve-year-old noises at the turkey. Madeline didn't look at them. On a Thanksgiving day, two years ago, her Tommy, so young, so boyish, so sweet, had done the same thing. And his last Thanksgiving dinner had been rotten fish heads. Tommy... her heart cried.\nShe toyed with the food on her plate, and the little she put in her mouth was as tasteless as paper. The boys ate like ravenous children, exclaiming, complimenting Nora until she looked as if she'd float to the ceiling if she hadn't been weighted with food.\n\"Oh, boy! won't I ever remember this dinner,\" Bill Benning said conceitedly, as Nora served him a slice of mince pie, one of pumpkin, and a piece of fruitcake for the second shelf. \"When I get my insurance business going, and get me my wife, the Blakes are coming to our house for dinner. And Trudie had better be been learning to cook.\"\nBruce said, around a bite of pie, \"Where are you going to start this business?\"\n\"In my home town.\" Bill's tone indicated that anyone was foolish to suggest anywhere else. \"I got a girl there. She's full of plans. I have quite a bit saved when you've got a girl at home you don't spend much money except to send her stuff.\"\nMADELINE found herself thinking that this Bill had personality, and that's what it took, as much as business ability, to get ahead in insurance. How could he look forward to a future, though, without feet? She suppressed a shiver. How could a girl...\n\"My girl says it isn't feet that make the man... and she's right... as if I didn't know,\" Bill went on. \"I can go tramping through the woods... in all kinds of weather... can get my feet frostbitten.\"\nBoth boys laughed at this, but Madeline wanted to cry. A boy with no feet probably couldn't play tennis, couldn't dance...\n\"But what do you plan to do, Sergeant?\" Ross asked Brent.\n\"Oh, I figure a pegleg's good for almost anything. I've got me a big ranch out west. That is, I sent the money to my folks when I was in the hospital, and they bought it for me. I'll raise horses... race some of them, maybe... I like to ride. Always have. Swell setup.\"\nMadeline, for the first time since she arrived, felt the urge to speak directly to them. \"You can ride horses?\"\nHe grinned at her. \"Yes'm, it'll be a cinch. Great future in the horse business.\"\n\"Oh, boy! when this is all over, the future sure is going to be hectic,\" chuckled Bill, \"lots of competition... the spice of life... my dad always says.\"\n\"What tells you turn out,\" Brent scoffed.\nAs Madeline heard their laughter this time, it didn't shock her as it had at first. A great future, these boys said! How did they know? Their future was filled with handicaps. If Tommy... And sad-denly, she know that Tommy, clean, wholesome Tommy, was taken care of. A boy as fine as he would be in eternity. She realized that Tommy had no handicaps. But these boys had theirs... and their future was facing it. After all of the horror they had been though they still seemed to feel that the world was a wonderful place. If they had been frightened once, they had recovered.MADELINE knew, then, that she hadn't been frightened or grieved because she was feeling sorry for Tommy half as much as she had been feeling sorry for herself. Nora was right. She had been selfish. Her sadness came because she could no longer have the comfort of Tommy's presence, the opportunity to mother him. For the first time since word of Tommy's death, she felt a loosening of the tension and pain within her. Her heart quieted. These boys with their love, their faith, their fearlessness... They had come from blood-drenched battle fields, but they hadn't allowed the suffering to show. They were now thinking of it, not as suffering, but as a ticket of admission into the future. They had learned that they must watch their step; but that didn't mean that they thought the world was hopeless. She remembered when she was young... She could almost hear her grandparents saying that this younger generation was not as stable as the older folk. As people grew older they seemed to become more frightened... Many of them because they weren't strong enough in their faith. She knew now that the future held whatever one wanted it to hold. Bruce had known that... Dear Bruce... But she hadn't allowed him to try to tell her what he knew. For the first time since Tommy was taken prisoner, she felt sure that she could weep. If she were alone she would lie on her bed and let the tears bathe and refresh her awakened heart. But she was not alone. She found herself turning to Sergeant Sherwood and smiling at him. \"If you gentlemen are still in this part of the country at Christmas time, my husband and I would like to have you spend Christmas with us.\" At Nora's pleased start of surprise, she said, \"Tou and Ross, too, of course, Nora. And Jimmy will probably be home by that time, too.\""

[Prepared at the request of the Church Beautification Committee. DURING Utah's Centennial celebration the much-anticipated postwar \"Golden Era of Sports\" should be at its height. Both amateur and professional athletics, games, and exhibitions, even now are headed for the biggest boom in history. There will surely be more sports and greater crowds with an all-time record for gate receipts. The impetus for this frenzy was provided by wartime games and recreational promotions.  Salt Lake Tribune Photograph, 1941 HENRY W. RICHARDS AND AB JENKINS IN A 1901 MODEL CAR Page 654 SPORTS AND UTAH'S CENTENNIAL 655  Photograph by Bill Shipler AB JENKINS IN THE \"MORMON METEOR\" AT THE UTAH SALT FLATS A lot of speeches were made and countless words written concerning the need and importance of sport while the great conflict was on, all of which was quite unnecessary. I have never believed that sport needed any defending. It is a big part of American life the American way. It can stand on its own. There are times when one can \"protest too much.\" There are just three reasons why sport will go on from here to new standards of performance and patronage: 1 \"The majority of the people want it. Last year, supposed to be a \"flop\" year, was one of the biggest in the realm of sports. 2 It is something needed in the way of physical fitness, where to attain any decisive result, it must be based largely upon the competitive side. 3 Sports provide a most useful vehicle for the raising of funds for charities. This was proved during the war. It could do a much bigger job in peacetime with the proper organization. One of the major promotions that was hit hardest during the war was automobile racing. This is one activity which is not only a sport, so far as public interest is concerned, but is of great importance to mechanical research. It is fortunate for our State and our people, that we have, right here, the world's greatest automobile racing course. MORE records have been set on Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats than any other place in the world where sport is projected. None of this activity was indulged in during the war for obvious reasons, but the Utah race course is certain to get a brisk going over from this time on. The developments and advancements of automobile and airplane construction and operation are to come in for still further tests and perhaps much that is valuable to the automobile industry will be revealed. It is reasonably certain that John Cobb and Sir Malcolm Campbell, the famous English racers, will come here again with new types of cars and fresh ideas on record breaking. Photograph courtesy A. Lee Christensen SKIING AT ECKER HILL, NEAR PARK CITY, UTAH It was my privilege to help promote their previous appearances here, and I can testify as to the great good they did for Utah and the Bonneville Salt Flats through the favorable impressions they received. I expect to set still more records with a 3400-horse-power car, which will be 1,000 hp. More than any automobile I ever drove. It will also be the lightest of my several racing automobiles. What is planned in automobile racing during the Centennial year. Is typical of what is scheduled in other sports. College football will go big league in Utah that year. It is planned to bring one of the major aggregations of the country, such as Notre Dame, Southern California, or Michigan, to play the University of Utah. Another nationally important eleven will be brought in for Utah State and another for Brigham Young University. The new American Basketball League, in which Salt Lake has taken a franchise through the sponsorship of a club by the Deseret News, plans for the national AAU tournament for the teams of that league SPORTS AND UTAH'S CENTENNIAL and the University of Utah to make a bid for the national collegiate championship. Salt Lake has already been granted the national clay courts tennis tournament for the Centennial, and the Professional Golfers' Association is considering a petition to bring the P. G. A., biggest event in golf, to one of the Salt Lake courses. 657 In baseball, swimming, wrestling, boxing, bicycle riding, rodeo and every game played in Utah, something extraordinary is being planned by the Utah Centennial Sports Committee.

            "content": "Better Book Buying for the Home Dr. Howard R. Driggs FAR more than just books and magazines make a good home library. It takes intelligent planning to create this intellectual and spiritual center of family uplift and recreation. Nor can a lastingly attractive home library be made in a day, a month, or a year. Time and co-operative effort on the part of both parents and children are required. Not much money, comparatively, is necessary to possess a really effective home library. No such initial outlay as that for a piano, an electric or gas range, or even an ordinary' stove, or for rugs and drapes, linen or china, is necessary. Choice books may be had for a few dollars each, or even less  and they can be purchased on the best kind of installment plan one at a time; pay as you go. Why, then, do not more of our homes have good libraries? Why is it that in too many homes, whose possessors are proud to show visitors other choice furnishings, the library is seldom if ever mentioned? Do parents generally appreciate the vital, lasting values in good books? Many do, of course; but it would seem that many more need to cultivate such appreciation in themselves and their children. All of us will profit by giving more earnest thought and study to the problem of creating and using home libraries. Book buying, for the most part, seems now to be a rather hit and miss affair dictated too much Page 658 by what seems popular. This prevalent practice certainly needs changing for the better. Our central purpose in this article is to offer a few practical, forward-pointing suggestions in the spirit of helpfulness to those who would make their home libraries more effective for good. Books, first of all, are silent companions active for good or ill. No right-thinking parent would invite any but wholesome companions into the home; yet unthinking ones often permit books there whose influence is more evil than good. How can it be prevented? Keep closer to the reading matter that absorbs children. Know, so far as you can, your children's books. I This, of course, is not so difficult while the children are young. During their tender years, when they are ever begging for nursery rhymes and tales, the father and mother usually find time to enjoy books with the little ones. As they grow up, it is not so easy and yet, more than we often realize, these little men and women are just as hungry for parental love and understanding as they were as babes though they may be less open in showing it. One of the best ways of keeping close to the minds and hearts of young folk is to grow up with them through sharing their books. Be actively interested in what is interesting to growing youth. Yes, we grant that it is difficult to find time for all this in connection with other pressing duties; yet there are ways BETTER BOOK BUYING FOR THE HOME 659 of doing it as many mothers and fathers have proved. And precious time may be saved by thus keeping close, and tactfully guiding young minds and hearts aright as occasion arises. Best of all rewards to come from such devotion is this: it helps keep parents youthful. ANOTHER rich return from this loving effort is here. In studying books for youth, there is real education. No one can read even part of the books that are prepared today for the young without gaining a broader outlook on the world its geography, its history, its science, its literature, its art. Many a parent, denied the privilege of taking courses in high school or college, has in some measure made up this lack by studying with his or her children. It is our feeling that time should be set aside every day, or regularly during the week, for such co-operative study between young and old. This is particularly important during the childhood and early youth  the formative years. A story hour, the reading of poetry, of the Bible, and other choice literature, brings spiritual uplift, cultivates appreciation for the best in books, and leave'* golden memories to guide and inspire through life. Through a choice home library-beginning with only a few book friends  these riches of reading and companionship between parents and children may be fostered. With the years, the library will grow; well-selected books and wholesome magazines may be added. Well-chosen pictures also, make for attractiveness. If a separate room can be set aside, with proper light and warmth and ventilation, it will become a center for the members of the family and even their friends to enjoy. Nothing is of greater import than such home enrichment. As for the books that should be brought into the home library, these may be varied. Each well-planned library will reveal the individuality of the members of the home. Yet in every such collection of books there should be certain ones that are standard and basic. No library, for example, would be complete without a Bible. For Latter-day Saints, the other standard works of the Church are essential. Besides these, a good dictionary and a good encyclopedia are constantly helpful. A good history of our country is another essential volume. Likewise, each member of our Church should possess a good history of the Church as a reference. Added to the foundational books just suggested, provision should be made to satisfy the needs of children in the home. Here is where more careful study and selection should be made. For little folk, many, many books are being created every year; and fond parents are constantly buying these  not often wisely. A few guiding suggestions may be helpful here. First, see that the book you buy is both wholesome and interesting. A good test is to read a few pages aloud. Watch the content; see whether the words are simple, the lines musical in effect, the story or poem of appeal to childhood. Children's books that live and last pass these basic tests. Pictures that adorn books for little folk should be childlike in spirit. Avoid the ornate, the over-stimulating in art. In many of the texts-primers and other readers we have today excellent examples of drawings suited for children. Study these. FOR the early boyhood and girl-hood, there should be books of more maturity. Youngsters like adventure; they enjoy nature stories of convincing cast; they are constantly asking: Is it true? Simple biographies of heroes and heroines give them satisfying materials. Stories of boys and girls if told with a ring of truth, hold their interest. Added to this, they have a sense of humor that must be satisfied. This is shown in their zest for the \"funny pictures\"  just as their keen desire to listen to exciting plays on the radio or see them in the photoplay reveals their craving for adventure. If these gripping challenges to parents are to be met, it must be by providing, likewise, gripping books that hold the interest. Parents, too, must be ready to help their children find the joys within the storybook by sharing this recreation with them  not always an easy thing to do, we admit, but well worth the efforts made to keep close. One of the places where the difficulties increase is when the boy and the girl reach adolescence. Here romance social problems add complications. Unfortunately, this is an age which seems in a measure to have been neglected by writers. We have too few wholesome, and at the same time gripping books, for the adolescent. As a result, our young folk are too often finding their reading matter within the books created for grownups. There are, of course, some volumes of perennial appeal for young folk of high school age. We need far more of these. All of the foregoing suggestions are, we realize, rather general. Guide lines only can be offered in this brief presentation. Any list of books appended to this discussion particularly without helpful annotation, would be inadequate. Here, however, are two specific suggestions that may prove helpful: First, Christmas book buying-offers a good chance to begin better hook buying for the home. Make a careful study by examining books offered for sale. Second, consult a librarian or a teacher for guidance in book buying for children of given ages. Third, let a committee be appointed to study the question of book buying as it applies to your own ward or town. Some years ago throughout Utah the parent's classes won the co-operation of bookdealers in having well-selected books for young folk placed on the shelves for Christmas. This practice needs to be renewed and extended. Merchants, generally, are glad to co-operate in this effort to get better books into the homes. Concerted effort on the part of all our Church organizations in the making of guide lists would provide another helpful plan of action. Already, our various magazines are giving helpful book reviews. We commend these. What further seems needed is greater unity of action on the part of the different organizations to give parents and children guidance in this vital matter of building and using good home libraries."

And delicate cerise and copper hue, Arranged like bits of muslin overlaid In pointed rows that circle into place Like caps atop a mass of deep sea green; Indented leaves, faced with a pearly sheen, To coalesce like knitted bars of lace. Long months of summer sun and cooling rain Have wrought this miracle of loveliness. And held it in reserve till hill and plain Have lost all other blooms, and frosts caress Has blighted them, but these fair flowers will stay To greet the snowflakes of a winter's day. NOVEMBER Courtney Cottam Now, when November's melody is heard Upon the world's great rust and ambered harp. Lingering as the call of a winter-bird In lonely looning when the winds blow sharp. It plays a threnody among the stalks Of roses, now betrayed by fall's embrace; Then strums a pagan chant on leaf-strewn walks, And hums an age-old hymn through bare twig lace. Through my wild heart this rhapsody is sung, That throbbing, beats in unison with these. The stubble-pattern of fields; the trees \" In filigree against the sky, star-flung. November's melody is bitter-bright. Yet brings a quiet, memoried delight. Page 661 Sixty Years, Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, November 1, and November 15, 1885 \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women OF All Nations\" HUMILITY Alas! I am afraid that the hearts of many of us are far, far from being meek and humble. Wealth and position cause many of the weaker minded of our sex to forget the example Jesus has set before us, or the commandments that he caused ta be written for us to follow after.... Then, how important it is that we do as he bids, and humble ourselves.... In these critical times how necessary it is that we, as women of Zion, as mothers and wives of men holding the Priesthood, should lay aside our world-liness... And set the example of humility before our children, that we may not be the cause of their going astray.... Sisters, the most beautiful jewels a woman can adorn herself with are humility, virtue, modesty and intelligence. They contain no dross, but are the real, genuine metal. Adorned with these, the most homely face will reflect forth the soul within, until it appears really beautiful. Ida. MISCELLANEOUS: He is never without dignity who avoids wounding the dignity of others. Considering one's own weakness is a great help to gentleness in dealings with others. Love must have expression, or it will die. It can be kept forever beautiful and blessed as at first, by giving it constant utterance in word and act. The more it is allowed to flow out in delicate attentions and noble service, the stronger and more satisfying and blessed it will be. The house becomes home only when love drops its heavenly manna in it fresh every day; and the true marriage vow is not made once for all at the altar, but by loving words, helpful services, and delicate attentions to the end. Pleasure is a shadow, wealth is vanity, and power is a pageant; but knowledge is ecstatic in enjoyment, perennial in form, unlimited in space, and infinite in duration. LEGEND OF THE BEAUTIFUL HAND: There was a dispute among three ladies as to which had the most beautiful hands. One sat by a stream and dipped her hand into the stream and held it up; another plucked strawberries until the ends of her fingers were pink; and another gathered violets until her hands were fragrant. An old, haggard woman passed by and asked, \"Who will give me a gift, for I am poor?\" Ail three denied her; but another who sat near... Gave her a little gift and satisfied the poor woman. And then she asked them what was the dispute, and they told her, and lifted up their beautiful hands. \"Beautiful, indeed,\" said she when she saw them. But when they asked her which was the most beautiful, she said, \"Tt is not the hand that is washed clean in the brook, it is not the hand that is tipped with red, it is not the hand that is garlanded with flowers, tut the hand that gives to the poor is the most beautiful.\" As she said these words, her wrinkles fled, her staff was thrown away, and she stood before them an angel from heaven with authority to decide the question in dispute. And that decision has stood the test of all time. Selected. Page 662"

            "content": "The Idaho Falls Temple Dedicated Possibly no more solemn nor glorious an occasion is offered to Latter-day Saints in mortality than the opportunity to attend the dedicatory services to our Heavenly Father of one of his temples. To those who were privileged to be present at any of the eight sessions held in conjunction with the dedication of the beautiful Idaho Falls Temple on September 23, 24, and 25, 1945, the memory will remain sacred to them forever. All the general authorities of the Church were in attendance throughout the three-day sessions and delivered impressive and moving addresses. An enveloping spirit of peace and thanksgiving entered into the hearts of the assembled saints and banished from their thoughts the worries and cares of this world. The veil separating this world from the hereafter seemed thin indeed. During the great dedicatory prayer by President George Albert Smith, all the congregation united in fervent supplication to the Father that the petitions sought for and the blessings invoked in the dedicatory prayer might be granted. In deep humility many firm resolutions were silently made to join more ardently in the future in the necessary work of welding the chain of the human family back to Father Adam. When the reminder was sounded, \"And he (Elijah) shall plant in the hearts of Page 664 the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming,\" the thought was awakened that each time a new temple is erected the warning note of Malachi's prophecy, as quoted to the Prophet Joseph Smith by Moroni, becomes less dread. Following the inspiring dedicatory prayer, those present at each session joined in the Hosanna Shout, and ensuing beautiful musical selections served to impart a feeling of heavenly benediction on the scene. As the saints reluctantly left at the conclusion of a session, involuntarily many eyes were drawn back for a final glimpse of the mural opposite the entrance to the temple. This painting, portraying Christ standing in an attitude of welcome to those entering, seemed to impose a feeling of personal obligation to perform temple work with renewed zeal. From a prayerful study of the proceedings of the dedicatory services of the Idaho Falls Temple, may Latter-day Saints everywhere be inspired to so order their lives that the blessings and promises which are obtainable only in a house of the Lord may be bestowed on them and their children in mortality, to be fully realized in the eternities to come. -M. C. S. ?Photograph by L. V. McNeely THE IDAHO FALLS TEMPLE Dedicated September 23, 24, 25, 1945 A. A- \"Oh hear O hear, O hear us, O Lord! And never these petitions, and accept the dedication of this house unto thee, the work of our hands, which we have built unto hy name; And also this Church, to put upon it thy name. And help us by the power of throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb And let these, thine anointed ones be clothed with salvation, and thy saints shout aloud for joy. Amen, and Amen. (Doctrine and Covenants, 109:78-80). From the inspired dedicatory prayer offered by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple March 27, 1836, preceding the Hosanna Shout which has since become a traditional feature of the dedication of all Latter-day Saint temples."

            "content": "The Star Burns Bright Sibyl Spande Bowen Sibyl Spande Bowen, a gifted Latter-day Saint writer, died in August 1945. AAN MA written many excellent stories and articles for TheHer serial, \"The Shining Heart,\" was featured in 1939. THE woman almost closed the cabin door against the rising wind before she saw the dim figure plodding through the snow-clogged path toward her. She hustled Martha into a big kitchen, warm with lamplight and red shafts from the grate of the big stove. The girl stood silent, dazed with the sudden heat. Seena Furnstrom's big hands unwound the girls muffler, took off her heavy coat, and pushed her gently into the black rocker. \"Tou, Miss Dexter, why aind't you wit' party you go for, over Christmas?\" Martha pulled off her gloves, and brushed snow from the aura of pale yellow hair that escaped under the band of her parka hood. There was blue fire in her angry eyes. \"Why!\" she exploded, \"because Fm just Martha Dexter, the girl who smiles when her date passes her up, the slow-witted blond who doesn't mind being a poor second to the measles of the Jenks twins or to the boil on Sven Neilson's neck-but this time I'm through.\" Seena had a cup of hot soup from her ever-boiling black kettle to offer with her soothing cluck, \"Now, Miss Dexter, the doctor make you so mad many times, but you always get glad right soon. He has to go when people is sick, huh?\" Martha waved the soup cup excitedly. \"People! People, yes! Seena, this time it was a horse. He takes me, Martha Dexter, twenty miles through the snow to a house party, and then leaves me flat. 'So sorry, darling,' he says, 'but Bill Hal-ton's horse is sick.\"\" She remembered the soup and salted it with the sudden tears of her rage. \"I came back on the mail sled.\" 'All Halton's horses cost money,\" Seena commented mildly, and turned a pair of big fur-lined boots to the fire glow. She drew a note from the pocket of her checkered gingham apron and handed it to the girl slumped in the big chair. \"This telegram... Ole brought it up from the toll station last night.\" At first it was just words, scrawled in Mrs. Todd's uncertain hand. Then Martha sat up, her eyes determined, spots of red in her cheeks. She noted the lined boots, the sheepskin coat, the robes, warming before the fire. \"Ole going out for freight-Christmas Eve?\" Her voice was high with excitement. \"Christmas Eve, yes.\" There was a flare of old resentment in Seena's words, then she was stolid again. \"Sure, when the freight comes, Ole got to get it, or lose his job.\" But Martha scarcely heard her. She jumped up and hugged Seena excitedly. \"I'm going with him. Seena, this telegram?from Herbert. He's on his way from Chicago, and hell wait for me at Junction?one Page  day. Darling, I'm getting out of here. Wolf Hill School will be minus one slave-driven teacher, all six grades of it. Fm meeting Herbert.\" SEENA'S broad face was cool, faintly scornful. 'That thin feller that drove you up here last fall? Him with the hay fever and wearing everything to match?\" Martha's face flamed. \"Yes, and with the sense to live in a place where the lights go on with switches instead of matches, where you don't have to carry the heat in in a wood hod, and where the water comes out of faucets instead of from a bucket of melted snow! Oh, I'm sorry, Seena. You and Ole have been the best ever to live with, but I can't take it. I can't imagine why I ever had the notion I wanted to run away from Herb!\" Suddenly, she turned on Seena. \"And don't tell me the doctor won't like it. Fm sick and tired of hearing what Doctor Peter Thorne won't like.\" Seena turned a scornful back. T\"HE road was a fenceless, pathless blur under the runner's of Ole Furnstrom's bobsled. The twilight deepened to the monotonous jingle of the sleigh bells, to the soft hiss of snowflakes that steamed suddenly on the hot stove pipe that was thrust out from the rear vent of the covered sleigh. Martha, snuggled beside the round little stove inside the box, swaddled in one of Seena's good sheepskin robes, fed another stick of quaking aspen to the stove and pulled aside the canvas flap to take one last look at the valley before the road wound into the narrows. The valley! Plodding through eternal snowdrifts to the blizzard-swept little school on the ridge five times a week. Coming back to Ole's gray cabin to shiver or roast over the woodburner, malodorous of green quaking aspen, until Seena's never-fail supper of fried pork, potatoes, and dried-apple pie was ready. The valley! Dances in the chilly, barnlike structure with young men who bored her?young men who stood about the dance hall while the girls huddled around the rusty stove hoping to be rescued from the wallflower bench by one of these rustic swains! Martha lifted her face defiantly. This was all behind her. Ahead was Herbert, safe, cautious, civilized... Herbert The sleigh lurched to a stop, throwing Martha to her hands and knees. She shouted to Ole, who sat in the front seat in his sheepskin coat, scorning the heated interior. \"What's the matter?\" \"A man,\" Ole returned stolidly, and waited. In the grayish gloom of snow-filled air a lantern bobbed, swung in a signal by the darker bulk behind it. A voice shouted, \"Hey there!\" The figure plowed through the drifts and approached the sleigh, hauling up the canvas unceremoniously. \"A woman,\" he said in surprise, looking into the warm interior, \"just what I was waiting for.\" He reached in, took Martha's suitcase in his free hand and bawled, \"End of the line. Everybody out.\" Martha made angry efforts to stay the suitcase, then scrambled over the front seat. \"If this is your idea of a joke, you.... I?m on my way out of the valley, and we've got to keep going or we won't meet the stage at Halfway House, and I won't get home for Christmas...\"\nShe stopped, struck by the ridiculous likeness of her tale to the story of the \"Old Woman and the Pig.\"\nBut the man with the lantern was already plowing through the snow of the trail back. \"Come on, come on, Marty, and no back talk. Women don't grow on fence posts around here, and right now I need one, and while you're not exactly the one I'd have picked from a crowd, you'll do in a pinch.\"\nMartha caught her breath sharply. \"I might have known?the good old team-roller method. Everybody's wrong but you, Doctor Thorne. Ole!\" she called.\nOle was flintlike. \"The Doc, he need you. You better go, Miss Dexter. There'll be another stage another day.\"\nMARTHA was out, stepping along into prints the man ahead of her made in the deep snow. She heard him shout back to Ole Fornstrom. \"Drive along and tell Mrs. Perkes I want her here by morning, or else.\"\nMorning! Martha's anger flared, but she plodded along. It was a good quarter mile through the drifts down to the cabin by the frozen river. Doctor Thorne reached it ahead of the girl, and held the slab door open until Martha stumbled in, furred to the waist with new snow, her breath gasping her strained lungs, her pale hair about her face a rim of white. She leaned against the door, easing her breath-ing, seeing the room like a misty picture.\nTwo shaggy-haired children, a boy and a girl, hugging the ancient kitchen woodburner, stared at her with unwinking, round blue eyes. A smoke - streaked \"factory\" cloth, tacked to the walls and low ceiling, was torn in places from the rough logs it covered. The furniture was makeshift, a carpet-covered couch in the corner behind the stove; packing box cupboards curtained by the same red print that hung limply over the tiny window.\nPeter Thorne unwrapped himself like a tall cocoon from his tar-lined leather coat and helmet?Peter Thorne, red-haired, blue-eyed, and quite as unembarrassed as if the girl he had just kidnaped had never known his arms about her, his forth-right kiss upon her lips, had never flung his ring back to him just last night. (\"So you won't marry me, huh,\" he had said. \"Well, don't say I didn't warn you about what you're missing when you change your mind, darling.\")\nPeter Thorne completed his unwinding operations. \"Off with the fuzzies, Martha. Kids, this pretty lady is your new cook. Marty, she kids haven't had any supper, and neither have I.\"\nMARTHA just stood there, confused and angry; her impulse was to turn and run. Then from the other side of an inner slab door came a moan that rose to a shrill height, then died away. Doctor Thorne grinned, on the wry side. \"The stork is flying, Miss Dexter, frostbitten and snowbound, but on the job. So you see this isn't just a little game to annoy you. This is the trapper, Lafe Higgins' place, and of course he chose just this time to haul out a load of his kids. Buster, here, caught me just as I finished with Bill Halton's horse.\" The tallest towhead, the boy, offered in a timid voice, ?Top's going to find Santy in Junction and tell him to bring us sumpin.\" Peter Thorne looked at Martha with challenging eyes that were steel under the copper crest of his hair, and hard as the metal itself. \"That's great, kids,\" he said, \"now show Miss Marty where things are. She's going to be very, very busy,\" he finished significantly. And he turned to the slab door and left Martha. She looked at the children in despair. At the rise of the moans from the next room, panic rose to dry her throat. A baby being born.... And she, Martha Dexter, was here to face it with nobody else but Peter Thorne. There was water to boil, gallons and gallons of it, all reduced from the pails of snow Martha laboriously dug out and carried in. There were old sheets, instruments, to sterilize, with Peter Tliorne darting in from the bedroom to give his orders like a booming top sergeant. There was the stove to feed? always the stove to feed, from the frozen pile of aspen near the back door. The pile was just beyond a little cut spruce that leaned against the side of the house. Twice Martha passed the little spruce tree, twice she turned away from its mute appeal. \"\"As if I didn't have enough to do. Chances are it isn't even set in a stool,\" she i; aid to the wind. But Buster, tugging at his sticks of aspen, told her. \"Pop put it handy, so Santy could trim it when he comes.\" Behind her a sardonic voice said, \"Run up your ladder to bed, kids. Miss Marty is too busy to fuss around with Christmas trees.\" And when the doctor came out from beyond the slab door the next time, Martha was defiantly brushing snow from the branches of the tree triumphantly upright in the corner. \"Not one of the vital necessities around here just now,\" he murmured. \"It is vital,\" Martha insisted, \"because when Mrs. Perkes gets here-well, you know Mrs. Efficiency Perkes.' \" Peter Thorne stepped to the window and pulled aside the limp calico curtain. The snow lashed furiously against the small panes. \"Relax, darling,\" he said, \"and see what the weather man has brought us. Ole won't take his feet out of Mrs. Perke's oven until this blizzard blows over, and Lafe Higgins is no doubt holed up at Halfway House for the same reason.\" Halfway House! Furious tears splashed the cotton angel Martha jabbed onto the tree. The doctor was behind her, \"You never hang an angel upside down,\" he reproved mildly, \"and anyway, doesn't it seem a waste of energy to leave the valley on Christmas Day when you must be back in less than a week?\" MARTHA groped in her pocket and found the crumpled evidence of Herbert's telegram. Unsteadily she thrust it into the hand that touched her own. Silence followed. Young Doctor Thorne made another prolonged stay in the room beyond the closed door, and just when Martha's heart was unevenly not sure she had scored, he came back into the room THE STAR BURNS BRIGHT 673 with a soft, too gentle, \"So you're quitting.\" That was the way he said it?just as if she were running away, craven-ly, without cause. Nothing about the battle of snowdrifts, the loneliness, the struggle with six grades of badly-trained, indifferent children who really did not care a mangy sheep for the foundation stones of learning. Pink battle flags stained Martha's cheeks. ?Yes,\" she cried, stung, 'I'm quitting. Quitting a log cabin for a heated apartment. Quitting a snowbound hole in the hills for a place where a library isn't considered a sign of corruption. Yes, Doctor, I'm quitting.\" Outrageously, tears filled her eyes, so that she must turn back to the tree to fumble with a string of paper stars. Peter stirred at his boiling instrument pan. \"And I thought,\" he said softly, \"that given time you might figure out how Wolf Hill might someday have a library, too.\" \"I'm going home.\" It had b-come a battle cry. \"Okay, you're going home. But first you're stoking the fire and we're scrubbing up. The bird is perching right on the chimney,\" the red-haired doctor snapped, and somehow all the banter had left with the look he gave the girl. At last he believed her. BIRTH is a grim thing. There is sweat and anguish, the sharp cry of pain that seems unbearable, but is not. There is suspense that wears to agony, and the urgent need to do something, only to find that little can be done. Martha stood powerless in the midst of hours that had no end, her mouth dry with fear of this thing. But she heard the woman's words. \"Their stockings,\" the woman said, \"musn't forget to put them out. They're in the....\" Her rising shriek almost drowned her words. But Martha scrambled away. She can think of things like Christmas stockings when she's going through that, she told her amazed self. And then, somehow, it was over. The mother was asleep with that smile that made her kin to all the madonnas, and Martha and Peter crept into the kitchen, to stand staring at each other, as if they had shared a miracle almost too intimately; staring at the wooden cradle where the new baby slept, his tiny face wrinkled solemnly. Abruptly, Martha turned toward the window and looked out. Peter followed her, and parted the curtains wider. The hush of the room about them was part of the white silence without, a silence in which the very wind and storm had stilled. In a rift of the clouds a single star shone like a new-minted piece of silver. \"That star,\" Martha said, all the tide of her unshed tears in her voice, \"it's so bright, so alone. It might be The Star, on this night.\" Peter Thorne said, \"It is The Star, Marty. Often it shines, and I like to think that it guides the feet of someone who has lost his way.\" \"Lost his way?\" \"Yes, Martha. You're all wrong, you know, dear. You don't want that steam-heated apartment?and Herbert. You want the storm and strife of things up here. You want...\" the voice of Peter was very close, and if she but moved, his lips would be on her cheek. \"... Did you know you were wonderful tonight?\" MARTHA moved away, not sure of the tumult that pounded in her heart. Rebellious questions were on her lips, until she pulled the curtains violently to shut out the calm rays of the star. But when she turned, Peter Thome was not there. He was stretched out fast asleep on the lumpy surface of the old couch. \"So that's as much as it means to him! Sound asleep!\" Tired tears washed* her cheeks as Martha found her coat, her suitcase, and floundered up the snow-ridden trail to the road?the road gray in the faint dawn, and creaking under the runners of Ole Furnstrom's sleigh. Mrs. Perkes beamed from her hood. \"How did things go. Miss Dexter? I was ready to go down last night, but the doctor said, when he passed my place, there was no need. He wanted to get you used to the run of the thing, seein' as you was to be Mrs. Doctor.\" Martha staggered limply to the sleigh and got in while Mrs. Perkes landed her round self in the snow. \"Oh, yes,\" she answered dazedly, \"things went all right. They do with Doctor Thome, you know.\" The utter, unbelievable nerve of him! \"He's remarkable, ain't he?\" the smiling nurse agreed as she bobbed into the snow. Remarkable. The remarkable Doctor Thome. Martha chanted the words to the rhythmic sway of Ole's sled. She sat on a sheepskin with her chin in her knees and thought of Herbert, fuming in the drab discomfort of Junction House. She thought of Peter Thorne, of the sardonic blue eyes, the flaming crest and the salty tongue. She thought of the mother who took time out of her agony to remember her children's Christmas stockings, of the faithful trekking of Ole Furnstrom, who went on Christmas Day, that the lonely farmsteads of Wolf Hill might have their needed goods. She thought of a man who left a party to minister to a sick horse?Bill Halton's horse, that cost good money. Never once did she think of Martha Dexter, whose comfort had been so all-important. \"The Star burns bright,\" she said suddenly, and heard the pound of feet in soft snow behind her. \"If Ole weren't so soft about his horses I'd never have made it,\" Peter Thorne panted, scrambling in under the canvas. Martha could not look at him, but her mind saw him. Unshaven, blue eyes hollow in a tired face, a crooked grin. \"I don't blame you for being sore, Marty, but I've got to tell you how sorry I am for dragging you in on last night. I... [had a fool notion that seeing life in the raw... You might like to live it with me.\" Martha pleated the wet cuff of her glove, and was silent. The crooked grin faded a bit. \"Won't you say something? I'm a hardy hulk myself. I forget that everybody doesn't dote on the great open spaces where plumbing is something out of a catalogue, and... Well, hang it all, I guess a fellow like Herbert has more to offer a lovely girl like you than a back-country pill-shooter... Here, we're at the toll station. You can call Herbert and...\" THE STAR BURNS BRIGHT Martha was looking at him now, a bit of the light of stars in her blue eyes. 'Tete-?\" the name was natural on her lips?\"don't tell me ever again what you have to offer me. It's what I have to offer you, and Wolf Hill, and Lafe Higgins' kids, and the Furnstroms, and... Oh, Pete, what a narrow escape I had. Just think if you, and that Star, 675 hadn't reached out and grabbed me and set me right?Peter, are you listening?\" The words were breathless, almost pleading. A man's two arms about the girl he loves can be definitely more satisfying than any words ever spoken, but Peter risked a few. \"Darling, what do you think?\" was all he said."

Most of the leaves smiled up at the sun Glad that their summer's work was done, And whispering groups flew far away In the shining hues of their new array.

            "content": "Tables That Tell the Christmas Story Vesta P. Crawford \"CHRISTMAS comes but once a year, but when it comes it brings good cheer.\" This rhyme we learned as children, and there was a special brightness, a lasting splendor, associated with each word. Christmas this year, for most of us, will be a day of quiet rejoicing, a day in which we hope and pray for that lasting peace long ago promised upon the shining hills of Bethlehem. And yet there should be in our homes many visible tokens of joy and cheerfulness; there should be evidence of the spirit of love and giving. It has been said that Christmas was created for children that they might always remember the story of the Babe of Bethlehem and his gift to the world. Surely it is Christmas at home that becomes a never-fading picture in our galleries of good thoughts. One way to make Christmas beautiful is to decorate the dinner table. Let this be planned in advance with all the family participating. Select snow-white linen, a pale gold or light blue cloth, as a fitting background for Christmas colors and Christmas candles. Silver should be polished to jewelled brightness before the celebration. It is fun for the family and the guests to make place cards by putting their names in a box and mixing Page 676 them up. Then let each person draw out a name and make a place card for that person. Here is ample opportunity for the expression of individuality in design. An original verse makes a good place card; a gum-drop base, holding a \"sprig\" of evergreen is very pretty. Try using a gaily decorated cookie for a place card, or perhaps a little candle. Even a child can make a bright and pleasing decorative card. For that all-important centerpiece, here is a fist of holiday materials that may be used alone or in various delightful combinations: Candles Miniature Christmas chimneys made of cardboard Pine cones and cedar berries Colored Christinas tree decorations Evergreen branches Paper and plastic bells Stars and constellation arrangements Poinsettias Paper chains Mounds of popped corn Jerusalem cherries (bright green leaves and brilliant red berries) Figurines (sheep, shepherds, angels, camels, reindeer) Cotton, arranged to represent snow-mounded hills Cut-out silhouettes of Santa Claus Miniature artificial trees Weeds, grass, or grains, frosted with white enamel and decorated with artificial snow sequins Holly and mistletoe Oranges, grapes, tangerines, apples, or other fruits TABLES THAT TELL THE CHRISTMAS STORY 677 YOUR centerpiece may be as simple as three tall candles or as elaborate as a detailed representation of a cradle scene. You may place a poinsettia plant in the middle of your table, or you may make a minute procession of the Magi as they journey into white-walled Bethlehem. Some of the most beautiful decorative arrangements are the least expensive. Try this one for snow-white enchantment: before the deep snows of winter come, gather thistle twigs, rose-apples, wheat heads, bean pods, blackberry leaves, or similar contributions from the late fall garden. These are all potential ornaments. Dip them in common white enamel and let them dry slightly. Then sprinkle them with artificial snow crystals. Your gleaming twigs may be arranged for a centerpiece to use with a light blue or a pale gold linen cloth. A winter landscape makes a beautiful centerpiece. Use cotton for the hills, evergreen twigs for trees, a mirror for the pool. Amplify the t. Festive Table with Candles and Evergreens scene with a little toy house, a plastic dog, and a cotton lamb. Let Santa Claus approach in his loaded sleigh. Christmas decorating takes a little though a little planning, and much of the spirit of giving. Long afterwards, your children will remember that Christmas at home was bright and beautiful. Santa Claus in a circle of pine cones and evergreen twigs ?Frosted? weeds and evergreens. Colored Christmas tree balls and two red candles. Santa Claus and his sleigh on a ?glassy? pond. The ?trees? in the border are evergreen twigs. ILLUSTRATIONS BY BETTI WILLIAMSON"

            "content": "You Are Never Alone Norma Wrathall \nIT was a golden afternoon in late September of the year 1863 that Zina Gleason and her sixteen-year-old daughter Millicent sat on the south porch of the rock house, peeling fall apples for drying. Already the boards, stretched between sawhorses, were filled with fruit, and row it was time for the little girls, Hope, eight years old, and Ruth, six, to clamber up to the flat-roofed shed, and lay the quartered apples in neat rows in the sun.\nZina's dark braids, wound about her head, lent dignity to the calm pallor of her face, and there was serenity even in the sure movements of her strong hands, swiftly at work. Her sweet lips, firm from the discipline of pioneer life, curved only faintly as she smiled and spoke to her daughter.\n\"Don't lag now, Millie. We've only a few more.\"\nMillicent sighed, and pushed a stray wisp of hair from her warm forehead. \"Mama,\" she said, \"won't we ever be through? I feel as if I never wanted to see another apple again. Why do we have to put by so much fruit, anyway?\" The freckles stood out on her flushed cheeks.\n\"You know why, goose. And we're almost through. I'm saving the rest of my sugar for grape jelly. We can be proud of our cellar filled with jars, and of the dried fruits and vegetables in the attic. You've been a real help to me this summer, Millie.\"\n\"You can be proud?I'm just tired,\" sighed the girl, resuming her work. \"Mama, how did papa ever manage to get such a large ranch as this?seems like a smaller one would have done, and then we wouldn't have had so much work.\"\nZina's lips twitched as she answered, for the girls had heard the story time after time, and never seemed to tire of it. \"Your father came to this valley as a boy, to herd cattle for one of the ranchers. And his only possession was a fine race horse, a gift from his uncle. He traded this horse for his first five acres of land. Now he owns hundreds of acres, one of the finest cattle ranches in the valley, and you know how proud he is of his horses.\"\n\"Yes, especially the pair of bays he drives to Church every Sunday,\" Millie giggled. \"Last Sunday, when Mr. Peterson beat papa driving down Main Street, papa said it was because a gnat flew in Daisy's eye, and put her off her pace for a second.\"\nZina smiled, remembering the triumphant Mr. Peterson stroking his dark whiskers, while Jacob's reddish moustache bristled in annoyance. Her gray eyes gazed proudly out across the yard, bright with goldenrod, to the fields and pastures beyond where Jacob's cattle grazed?\"the land of a thousand springs,\" the Donner party had called it.\nRuth came scampering from the shed, her sister following, swinging a pan. \"Mama, there's a cloud of dust down the road?do you think it's papa?\"\nZINA stood up, dumping the rest of her apples into Millie's pan. \"We'll stew the rest of these for supper. No, I don't think it's papa. He said he wouldn't be back from town much before dark.\" She began lowering the water bucket into the built-up well on the porch.\n\"Maybe it's Indians! Oh, mama, if it is, will you get anything?\" Hope began jumping up and down with excitement.\nThe little girls ran out to the big gate, and in a few minutes came running back just ahead of two squaws. The younger squaw, with a papoose strapped to her back, was unknown to Zina, but she was well acquainted with old \"Indian Mary,\" expert in making woven baskets of native reeds. Hope, suddenly shy, peeped out from behind her mother at the black-eyed papoose, while Zina bargained with the squaws, giving butter, sugar, and some dried fruit in exchange for the mending basket, light and firm in her hands, and smelling faintly of wood smoke.\nThe usually silent squaws chattered strangely in their own tongue as they went away, and Zina frowned with annoyance as they jabbered and pointed at things about the place. Indians were getting downright brazen nowadays, she considered. Some of them were said to be outlaws and out beggars, and the ranchers' wives had been warned of thieving old Nowans, who came begging and stealing when women and children were alone. But then, you couldn't wonder at it, she thought, as she busied herself getting apples at work. Skull Valley Indians were very poor,\nand in bad seasons had hardly enough to eat.\nAs she worked, she smiled and talked to the baby who lay in the hand-carved cradle which Jacob had made before Millie was born. It was fine to be living in the new two-story rock house, with its two wide porches, convenient well, and cupboards built clear up to the ceiling in the kitchen. The two-room, battle-dotted log cabin of frontier days seemed poor by comparison.\nBut the baby slept in his cradle, the oil lamps were lighted, and supper dried in the warming oven by the time Jacob returned, laden with parcels. He gave Zina a resounding kiss, causing her pale cheek to color faintly. Jacob was a heavy-set man, his skin ruddy from outdoor life, his tireless energy sparkling in his blue eyes and bristling in his reddish whiskers.\nZina drew back. \"Jacob, the children . . .\" \"Then she saw someone with him.\n\"I brought Wilmer home with me?got some supper for us?\" Jacob was saying, genially.\nZINA welcomed the scout, Wilmer M. Dee, who was dressed in picturesque shirt and trousers trimmed with fringe.\n\"Mr. Dee, did an Indian make your suit?\" asked Ruth, wide-eyed, marveling as he nodded.\nIt was as they ate the good supper of stewed dried corn, home-cured ham, cottage cheese, and cool milk which Zina kept immoderately fresh in the springhouse, that Jacob made his abrupt announcement. \"Guess you'll have to get along without me for a few days, Zin. We're driving out to Lakeside with the cattle early\n\nin the morning. YOU ARE NEVER ALONE 681 Wilmer's going part way to help us get started. We want to get an early start. Peterson's going out, too, with his outfit. He thinks he can beat us with that string of no-good nags of his.\" He put his hand to his moustache to hide a grin. \"Looked to me like he had a pretty good outfit? chuckled Wilmer, \"as a matter of fact, Mrs. Gleason, Fm just going as far as the Point of the Mountain.\" Zina glanced up in surprise. \"Out to Lakeside? Isn't this earlier than usual?\" She thought that a fleeting glance passed between the two men, and Jacob answered slowly, \"We-1-11, no. Not for this season. The Indians say we're going to have an early winter, and so we might as well get the stock settled. It'll mean more than one trip out, best we can do.\" \"Mr. Dee, how did you learn to talk Indian language?\" put in Milli-cent, \"And what is it they call you, tell us, please?\" Mr. Dee's quietly twinkling eyes became sober, and the creases deepened in his lean, deeply tanned cheeks. \"It's a story I seldom tell,\" he began slowly, \"because, you see, many people would not believe it? but I'll be glad to tell it to you folks.\" \"I've heard you have a wonderful power over the Lamanites,\" murmured Zina, unconsciously using the scriptural name. \"It came about in this way,\" began Dee, \"as you know, I've had lots of dealings with the Indians, as a guide and scout for many years. But for a long time, I was handicapped by not knowing their language. You know how an Indian talks our language, a few grunts and one or two words.\" He paused, and somehow even the children had become very quiet in the mellow lamplight. \"Well,\" he continued, \"I made it the subject of prayer. Night after night I prayed for the power to understand our red brethren. But nothing happened. Then, one time, I went into the hills with team and wagon for wood. My companion, who was helping me, was a young Indian who knew scarcely a word of English. Finally, it was his turn to sit at the front of the wagon and drive the team while I rested. I dozed off to sleep.\" Mr. Dee's voice became softly husky as he continued, \"It was a wonderful thing. I could hardly believe my own ears. But when I awoke, that young Indian asked me a question and I answered him in his own tongue.\" They were all quiet for a moment, then Ruth piped up, \"But what is it they call you, Mr. Dee?\" \"Well, the nearest they can come to pronouncing Wilmer M. Dee, is 'Widdem-e-dee.\" \" Everyone smiled, and the talk turned to plans for the morning. As Jacob bade her good-bye before daylight next morning, Zina felt a sense of foreboding. Accustomed to staying alone at the ranch with the children, she felt a strange loneliness, as she stood on the porch and heard the hoofbeats of the horses die away. She shivered when a coyote howled in the distance. Then she turned quickly back to the warm, lighted kitchen. SOCIETY MAGAZINE?NOVEMBER 1945 It was the third day after Jacob had gone that Ike Harrison brought fresh meat from his butcher shop in RELIEF town, as was his custom at certain intervals. The little girls ran out to meet him, gathering bunches of grass for his white mare, which, as far back as they could remember, had been as weary and woebegone as now. IKE was a skinny little man, with a short white goatee which he had to stroke before giving any kind of an answer. Zina selected the meat she wanted from his canvas-topped wagon, while Ike stood shooing away the swarm of flies which always gathered, though the meat was clean enough under layers of heavy paper and cool leaves. It was after he had eaten his customary piece of pie that he asked, \"Heard about the Indian trouble, ma'am?\" Zina raised her eyebrows. \"Indian trouble? That sounds like frontier days. Are you sure, Ike?\" Ike stroked his goatee thoughtfully. 'Tep. Seems there's been a renegade band come in?been rus-tlin' cattle from the ranches?some trouble maker's stirred them up with talk about the white man stealing the Indians' range. Guess that's why your husband and Peterson have taken their cattle out to Lakeside already. Better be careful out here all alone. Well, I've got to be on my way. Good day, and thank ye kindly, ma'am.\" Zina frowned thoughtfully as she watched him drive away, slapping at the indifferent old mare with the harness lines. She hardly believed his story; and yet, why had Jacob and Mr. Dee looked at each other in that odd way when she asked if it was early in the season for Lakeside? And suddenly, she remembered the strange behavior of the two squaws. Had they known of trouble afoot? Then she shook herself. Surely there was nothing to fear. That night the baby had croup, and Zina trailed wearily up and down stairs getting water hot for steam, and warming flannels. At last she lay down beside him on her bed, and was almost immediately asleep herself. It was still dark when something wakened her. She leaned up on her elbow and listened, but the house was quiet to her straining ears, with only the crowing of an early rooster breaking the deep silence. She lay down again, and was just beginning to doze, when she jerked suddenly awake. Her heart hammered in her ears. Was that a sound from the kitchen? She remembered that she had left the outside door unbolted when she had gone to the well for water. It was several moments before she could put her feet to the cold floor, slip into her flannel wrapper, and creep cautiously downstairs. CAREFULLY, she pushed open the stair door, and peered into the. Kitchen. There, in the half light, she saw an Indian bending over her sugar can, his black hair stringing about his neck, and his body bare above the waist. She exerted all her power to keep from screaming, and the suppressed sound seemed to swell and throb in her throat. Above her panic, words began to form in her mind?there's nothing to be afraid of?it looks like old Novaris?and he's stealing my sugar. YOU ARE NEVER ALONE 683 The sound of scraping on the bottom of the can enraged her-the sugar, saved carefully for the grape jelly! She put out her hand and encountered the long buggy whip with which Jacob urged his bays to even faster trotting. Seizing it, she pushed open the door. \"Novaris, get out of my sugar!\" she called, brandishing the whip. Then her knees turned to water as she saw the startled, evil face of a strange Indian! One thought was uppermost in her whirling brain-to get him out of the house. \"Get out?get out?get out of here?\" she heard her voice loud above the hammering of her heart. She wondered afterward just what caused the Indian to turn and run from the kitchen, leaving the sugar in a thin white trail across the floor. She slammed the door after him, but all at once, her arms were so weak she could hardly lift the heavy bolt into position. At last the door was fast, and she could sink to a chair, covering her face with her hands. \"Mama, what's the matter?\" Millie's warm young hand on her shoulder calmed Zina's trembling.. \"Nothing?nothing?just an old Indian stealing my sugar?\" she tried to sound matter-of-fact, \"but sh?don't waken the children?\" With shaking hands, Zina began winding the dark braids about her head. Millicent had gone to the window. She gasped, \"Mama. Look. Come here ?quick?\" Never in all her life was Zina able to forget the sight which met her eyes, and long afterward, she would waken in the night and grow cold thinking of it. In the gray dawn light, she could see the dark line of Indians on horseback threading their way quietly down the drive-lane, and toward the lower pasture, where the remaining cattle were kept. \"Mama-what'll we do?\" Milli-cent's terrified whisper was loud in the silent room. Zina put her arm around her daughter. Her mind whirled with remembered stories of Indian atrocities, of burned homes, stolen livestock, even?but she dared not finish the thought. ? \"They've come to steal the stock ?maybe the rest of the cattle and horses?\" \"Mama, mama! They might burn down the house. They might take us and \"Sh?sh?We'll think of something?we'd better dress. But don't make a light?it might attract their attention toward the house. Oh, if only the children will stay asleep?\" Trembling, hurrying, they dressed, glancing fearfully out the window at the Indians, now gathered in a group in the lower yard, their dark backs and brightly-colored feathered headdresses plainly visible in the increasing light. Zina spoke softly, drawing her daughter down beside her. \"Do you remember what Brigham Young has taught the people??'In all your troubles, remember that you are never alone?the Lord will hear you if you ask him earnestly.' Kneel with me, Millicent?Dear Father in heaven, please give me strength in this hour of need, and please, please, send us deliverance?\" AS they rose from their knees, there was a terrific shout from the yard, and the sound of milling hoofs. Then, above it, came the thin wail of the baby from upstairs, and the two frightened little girls came running to find their mother. In the confusion, trying to quiet their crying, Zina momentarily forgot her own fear. Presently, she held up her hand. \"Listen?the noise in the yard has stopped?\" \"Mama! Do you think the Indians have gone?\" \"Well, if they have, they've probably-\" There was a sudden loud knock at the door. Zina's heart came up into her mouth, and the baby puckered up his face to cry again at the expression on his mother's face. Drawing a deep breath, Zina opened her mouth to call out, but no sound came. There was another terrific knock, and then a voice, \"Hello?you all right in there, Mrs. Gleason?\" \"Oh, thank Heaven-Mr. Dee-\" Somehow, her fingers fumbling weakly, she unbolted the door, but not until he came in and helped her to a chair did she realize that tears were running down her cheeks. The children, who had been staring in stupefaction, suddenly set up a clamor. \"Where's the Indians, Widdem-e-dee? Did you drive 'em away?? Where's papa?\" He held up his hand, \"One at a time, now. I came in from the Point of the Mountain day before yesterday, and heard the mutterings around town about Indian troubles. Of course, Mrs. Gleason, we knew there was something wrong when we started the cattle out so early in the season, but never did we think anything like this would happen. Well, I was talking to old Ike Harrison in the butcher shop, about you being out here alone?early this morning, just before daylight. I took a notion to ride out here. Good thing I did.\" \"But the Indians? Did you?\" asked Zina. I've?been out there talking to them. As you know, I never carry a gun; it's the best way. They've agreed to wait here until the ranchers return. I think it can all be settled. We've sent a rider out to tell them to hurry in from Lakeside.\" That evening, after supper, as Jacob relaxed with a child on each knee, he said, \"Well, we made it-thanks to Dee. He certainly does know how to handle Indians?and incidentally?\" he stroked his moustache to hide a grin, \"we got in just a shade ahead of Peterson's outfit.\" Then his face became sober. \"But your mother's a brave woman, staying out here, facing danger alone with you children.\" Zina looked up from her work. Her gray eyes met his steadily, and the firm lips curved only faintly to smile. Slowly, she shook her head. \"No, Jacob. Never alone,\" she murmured. Wilt thou, our Heavenly Father, let thy presence be felt here always, that all who assemble here may realize that they are thy guests and that this is thy house. (Idaho Falls Temple Dedicatory Prayer) And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER VI SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, jilted by Hugh Temple, decides to \"make a play\" for Alec Windsor, a marine on furlough. Jeff Holden, principal of the school where Delsa teaches, is interested in Delsa, but she feels that she can save her face better by letting her friends think she has fallen in love with Alec, and has thrown Hugh over for the new attraction. DELSA'S father got out the pickup truck to take them to the wedding because they had so much \"truck,\" as he called it. Mrs. Marriott had made two giant freezers of ice cream, for no party was complete without some of this famous confection of hers. Aunt Martha had a huge chocolate cake. Delsa said, 'I'll walk over and meet you there.\" So they drove off with a clatter. Delsa tossed a shawl over her curls and went through the early dusk toward the hall. This was to be a real party, as Mrs. Lewis had planned, reminiscent of the parties they had when she was a girl. Lina's friends would serve while the older women took care of things in the kitchen. Later the girls would slip off home to change to their dancing frocks, while the men cleared the room. Delsa, of course, had plenty to do, so she was going over early. But others were there ahead of her. The men were putting planks on saw-horses to make long tables in the amusement hall. The women hovered about, white cloths in their hands, hurrying the men on. As soon as a table was set up, the cloth was laid and plates placed. Delsa smiled. It was a huge undertaking, but the women did not seem aware of that fact as they moved about laughing and talking. But Delsa noticed that there was a big difference between this and the last big party. Now there were no young fellows making a noise, teasing the girls, and doing a big share of the work. The older men sweated as they tugged in the planks, where before, the boys had done this job with a laugh. Delsa missed Millie, who had been her friend ever since they were children. But she knew that Millie and Alec had gone to the city with Jim and Lina and their parents, and that they would not be back until just in time for the dinner. Jeff Holden was there, with a crew of eighth grade and high school boys trying to take over the jobs their big brothers normally had. They were laughing and joking with the teen-age girls, and Delsa suddenly felt old as she watched them. She shook her head a little sadly and went out into the kitchen. They had all grown older, skipped a period in their growth, it seemed. Everything was ready by the time the newly married couple and their parents arrived. After everyone had shaken hands with them and kissed Page  them and wished them happiness, they all went into the long hall and sat down at the laden tables. There was a great deal of merriment during the meal?a few short speeches and toasts and a lot of wisecracking. Delsa, moving between kitchen and dining room, keeping her eyes on the girls who were serving, seeing that everything went smoothly, found little time to join in the repartee. But she did stop at the head table, where the bridal couple and their families and Alec Windsor sat, and watched them cut the towering wedding cake. THERE was an empty chair next to Alec and he said to Delsa, \"This is your place, Delsa. Why don't you make use of it?\" \"Yes, Delsa,\" Millie cried, \"sit here with us. You'll have to eat, you know, and I had them save this place for you.\" Delsa shook her head. \"I like my job as overseer,\" she laughed, \"and I get a bigger share eating in the kitchen.\" But Delsa was tired when at last the meal was over, and she was glad that she had earned the respite afforded by having to go home to change to her dancing dress. The Grayson girls, who lived a mile further up the road, offered to take her in their car as they slipped home for the same purpose, and Delsa gratefully accepted the lift. This would give her time to bathe and maybe lie down for fifteen minutes before going back to the dance. After her bath, though, she felt fresh and gay. She could hear the music coming from the dance hall and she found that she was im- patient to get, back there to dance with Alec. She was waiting for the Graysons when they stopped to pick her up again. The dance was in full swing when they entered the hall. The music set Delsa's nerves tingling, her feet beating time. She loved to dance, and Alec had promised to dance with her. She hoped he would see that she was there and would hurry to her. Just then he swung past her, dancing with Helen Ball, and seeing Delsa, he smiled and held up his hand in a quick gesture of greeting. As soon as that dance was over, he came across the hall to her, his steps and look eager. DELSA stepped out on the floor with him?felt his strong young arms about her, smelled the rough woolen fabric of his blouse, saw the band of campaign ribbons, even with her eyes, and she thought, why couldn't this be Hugh? Her arms tightened instinctively, and Alec's dark head bent just a little closer to her golden curls. They danced beautifully together, moving through the crowd with instinctive ease, so that it was almost as if they were alone on the shining dance floor. \"You look like an angel,\" Alec whispered, \"the kind of angel a fellow dreams about when he's alone in the jungle with danger all around him. The kind of angel that can make heaven become real with just a smile.\" Delsa laughed up at him. AND FOR ETERNITY \"What a line!\" she said. But the illusion that it was Hugh who was holding her close this way had been shattered. 687 Delsa sighed a little, and drew back, almost imperceptibly. Alec noticed it, however, and he said gently, \"Don't be offended, Delsa. I mean what I say. But I won't talk any more,\" and he tried to draw her closer again, as she had been before. Delsa was sorry that she had betrayed her reactions so plainly, and to make up for it, she let him hold her close, and tried to forget that this was Alec Windsor, strange marine, with whom she was dancing. When Alec took her to her place again, he didn't leave her, but sat down beside her and watched the other dancers. He told her of the trip to Salt Lake that day, the things he had done, the sights he had seen. When the music started again he said, \"May I have another dance, Delsa? Please? It's been a long time since I have enjoyed dancing so much?and it will have to last me for a long time when I go back.\" So Delsa danced with him again and again. It was wonderfully exhilarating, and she felt her senses tingling with excitement. Then she saw that others were looking at her, watching them together, and she grew a little uneasy. She wondered whether Millie was offended, what Jim was thinking. She wished someone would rescue her, and she began looking about for Jeff Holden. If she could catch his eye-As if in answer to her secret wish, Jeff came up to them after that dance. Delsa hadn't seen him since the dinner, but he had evidently been around somewhere in the crowd. Now he smiled down at her and asked in a cool, matter-of-fact voice, \"Isn't this our dance, Delsa?\" ALEC said, \"I guess I will have to share her, but I hate to. She's the most wonderful dancer I?ve ever found.\" Jeff laughed good naturedly. \"That's what we all think,\" he said, and led her out onto the floor. Delsa had danced with Jeff Holden hundreds of times. He was a good dancer and she had always enjoyed her dances with him. But as soon as he put his arms about her tonight, she sensed that there was a difference. She prodded her mind, wondering what that difference was. It wasn't Jeff's suit. The neatly pressed gray was as familiar to her as her own father's. It wasn't the way he held her, which was just the same as always, gently, tenderly?as if she were something precious, but familiar. Perhaps that was it, the very familiarity of Jeff's presence after the exciting strangeness of Alec Windsor's. At any rate, Delsa smiled to herself. She was relaxed and at peace?scarcely conscious that she was dancing at all. Jeff wasn't quite so tall as Alec, and his lips came just above her head. He had only to bend his head a little to bring his cheek against her hair, his lips close to her ear. He was bending his head now, and suddenly* Delsa was aware of an urgency that made Jeff's usually quiet voice vibrant. \"So Windsor likes to dance with you,\" he said softly. Delsa shook her head. \"He's lonely, Jeff. I feel sorry for him.\" Jeff's arms tightened, ever so slightly and he whispered, \"Delsa, darling! Darling!\" DELSA remembered then that Jeff was lonely, too. He had lost his love, just as she had lost hers. He was holding her now, thinking of Lucy, imagining she was Lucy, just as she had thought of Hugh when she had danced with Alec. She felt tears along her lashes and she thought, what a mess it all is? all of us wanting something we haven't got?something we can't have! She wished she could comfort Jeff, but she didn't know what to say. They finished the dance in silence, but Delsa was suddenly weary of the party. She didn't want to dance with Alec again?to feel the excitement racing in her veins after this realization of her own and of Jeff's utter loneliness. And she didn't want to dance again with Jeff?to feel his lips against her hair and to know that he held her close, dreaming of someone else. She turned to him as they walked across the floor. ?I'm going home, Jeff. Take me to Dad and Mother, please.\" But her father and mother had already left the hall. Jeff said, \"Wait here, Delsa. I'll get your coat.\" Delsa sat down on the bench that ran around the wall and looked at the dancers. They were still merry and noisy and she couldn't imagine why she was So tired, so utterly worn out. Jeff came back with her coat and held it while she slipped her arms into the sleeves. Then he took hold of one arm, turned Delsa gently toward the door, and walked out with her. \"Don't you leave, too, Jeff,\" she remonstrated. \"It's just a few steps. And thanks.\" But Jeff didn't let go of her arm. He walked along beside her, holding to her. \"I've got to talk to you, Delsa,\" he said quietly. \"I'm sorry, but it's got to be done. Tm in love with you, Delsa, deeply and truly in love with you, and I can't help showing it. Heaven knows I don't mean to. I know you don't like it?I can see you flinch, actually, and withdraw from me every time I come a little too close. You're thinking of Hugh Temple?and you're thinking that I'm pretty low to step in and try to take you away from Hugh when he's off fighting and unable to protect what is his. But I'm not trying to take you away from Hugh?I'm not going to take you away. I just want to explain so that you won't think too little of me.\" He stopped, as if at an end, and Delsa walked along slowly, wondering whether she should tell him about Hugh. It would be such a relief to tell someone. Jeff would understand; he would help her cover up the way Hugh had deserted her. JEFF went on, almost desperately, \"I can't help loving you, Delsa. I've tried to help it and I can't. Since you've been coming in to look after the children, what was just deep affection has grown into ardent love. But don't worry, darling, please. Now that you know, maybe you won't mind? maybe you'll overlook-\" AND FOR ETERNITY 689 Delsa turned to him and laid her hand on his arm. \"Jeff,\" she whispered, softly, and before either of them knew what was happening Jeff had her in his arms, holding her close, his cheek pressed deeply against the soft luster of her hair. \"Darling! Darling! Darling!\" he whispered, but he didn't raise her face to his, nor try to kiss her. Delsa stood quiescent in the circle of Jeff's arms. She wanted to put her arms around him, to lift her face to his lips, to say, Jeff I?m lonely ?and I am alone. Love me, Jeff; heal the wound Hugh has made.\" But she couldn't do that. Up to this minute Jeff and all her world had thought she was betrothed to Hugh. How could she say suddenly, 'It's all right? I've just been keeping it a secret, but Hugh and I are no longer engaged. Hugh wants to marry someone else.\" If Jeff wouldn't be shocked out of his love for her, he would at least be doubtful of her honesty. He would not be able to comprehend her silence, her deviousness. At last, Jeff's arms dropped from around her and he stood back, silent and contrite. \"You're lonely, Jeff,\" Delsa said miserably, \"and I'm lonely. And Fm to blame. Coming to the house, being with the children, I've reminded you?\" Somehow Delsa's lips wouldn't go on. She was suffering at the thought that she was merely a reminder of his dead wife. JEFF shook his head slowly. \"No, Delsa,\" he said. \"Let's not fool ourselves. I am lonely, lonelier now than I have ever been. But you do not remind me of anyone or anything. You are you, Delsa, and I love you?not because of a memory, but because of a dream of what might some, day be.\" They were at her gate now, and Delsa said soberly, \"I am lonely, too, Jeff. I am so lonely that I would find it easy to take comfort in your arms. But I won't do it. You're too good for that, Jeff?you're too good for what I could offer you. Let's forget what you have said and be good friends, just as we were.\" He said, \"I can't forget, but I will let you.\" \"Maybe I'd better stop coming into your house so freely as I have done-\" \"And make the babies suffer for my clumsiness? No, Delsa, come, please. I'll keep out of your way.\" He laughed a little bitterly. \"Go in; darling. Go to bed and dream of Hugh and when you awaken in the morning, think of this as part of a dream?a dream fostered by the warm spring breeze and the smell of growing things and the madness that comes with the awakening of the earth.\" She went up the walk and onto the porch. At the door she turned ahd Jeff was still standing there in the moonlight, watching her. She shut the door softly, and was glad that she was indoors and out of the reach of the spring night.

Then o'er the eastern hill The moon arose and spread her silvery light On hill and vale and set a magic spell. Can it be fancy that I see a small, old-fashioned gate, And leaning on the bar a form that waits As if to meet some dear one at the gate? It was not a maiden fair, as first I thought; Her hair was snowy white, her form was bent, And from her lips and cheek the bloom of youth was spent, And in its place a look of faith and sweet content. It seemed as if she did commune with someone near. I listened, and this is what she said: \"This is our trysting place. It was here we met And pledged our troth to walk life's path together And be true whatever betide, in fair or stormy weather.\" And then she paused and whispered low, Yes, dear, I understand. Our Father called you home. And I was left to finish tasks we both began; And still I wait to comfort children dear; But when my task is done. Til meet you here. Together we will kneel at Father's feet and plead for grace.\" And while they thus communed, a cloud passed o'er the moon. And in the mist they disappeared, and I awoke and found It was a dream. No stars, no moon, no gate, not even a form. And yet within my heart I know it was their trysting place. Their meeting in the twilight's magic hour. FRO! Blanche B. Stoddard, General Secretary-Treasurer Page 690"

LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 13?Stakes of Zion Increased Dr. H. Wayne Diiggs For Tuesday, February 5, 1946 Objective: To suggest the firm and sure way the Lord has of extending his purposes in the earth. AS a people, the Latter-day Saints have always closely linked the temporal with the spiritual. To them, faith without works is dead. There can be no true religion unless the widow and the fatherless are visited, the naked clothed, and Church members hold themselves unspotted from the world. This practical wisdom found in the Epistle of James, the Prophet Joseph Smith applied in all his teachings. He always set his followers to work knowing that if they did good, they would be good. On August 2, 1833, only three years after the organization of the Church, the Lord gave a revelation to Joseph Smith which touched upon the practical plans for bringing about the future city of Zion (Doc. And Cov. 97). There was to be work ahead for the saints. In June of that year, labor had started on the Kirtland Temple. Presiding Bishop Edward Partridge shortly before had been sent plans for this. Also he received a blueprint in words of the future beautiful cities of the world. How effectually the cities would combine the aesthetic and functional may be seen by the following: The first city plat was to be one mile square, divided into blocks containing ten acres each, except the middle range of blocks, which were to contain fifteen acres each. All the blocks, except those containing schools and public buildings, were to be divided into half-acre lots, four by twenty rods each. The dwelling houses were to stand twenty-four feet from the street. The plat would accommodate from, eighteen to twenty thousand inhabitants, and they would need twenty-five buildings for schools and public worship. These buildings would be temples, and none would be less than eighty-seven feet by sixty-one. There were to be no barns or stables in the city, but these were to be situated on lands laid off for that purpose, on the north and south sides of the settlement. The farms would be situated east and west of the city, but the tiller of the soil, as well as the mechanic, merchant and others, would live in the city. Page 695 \"When this square is thus laid off and supplied, lay off another in the same way,\" the Prophet wrote, \"and so fill up the world in these last days\" (ANDREW JENSON, Historical Record, page 635; see Doc and Cov. Commentary, page 751).\nWhat room would there be for slums with their attendant political vice, vice, and crime in such cities? The farmer, the worker, and the professional man here might live in mutual fellowship for the good of all and of society. There, country and city life would be blended and the place of religion and education be one.\nBut who could plan and build such communities? Certainly not those motivated by selfish interests of worldly minds. These centers of spiritual and social life could only come from a people who were \"pure in heart, for this is Zion\" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 97:21). Consider the words of the Lord, that Zion first is a state of mind, before ever it is a city or place upon the earth. God requires the heart as well as the hand. Without a first of these there cannot truly be a second. He has said he will plant the stakes of Zion throughout this land. Stakes in the first meaning of the word are pointed pieces of wood, to be driven into the earth as a mark for support to which may be tied lengthening cords used to hold above a flexible covering, adjustable to the changing conditions and needs of those who seek shelter beneath. In a religious sense, the meaning becomes even more significant. Stakes are territorial units of the land governed by presiding officers of the Priesthood of God, who plant within the marked boundaries the wards and branches of the Church, (which unitedly work for the common good of all the\nsouls who will be pure in heart). To set, therefore, the stakes of Zion would mean to build up the wards and branches of the Church from the standpoint of helping men to realize material as well as spiritual values. Ward chapels and stake tabernacles have with steadily increasing number been built within the large centers of urban life, as well as upon the rolling rural hills of the farm lands.\nPresident Brigham Young, in realizing the wise and far-reaching effects of the Lord in setting the hearts and hands of his people to work in the cause of redemption, commended upon the Prophet's vision of this great work as follows:\nIt was a perfect sweep stakes when the Prophet called North and South America Zion. Let us go to and build the temple (i.e., at Nauvoo and then building) with all our might, that we may build up the kingdom when established and her cords lengthened. It is a perfect knock-down argument, some say; but to the old and faithful elder (and I may say member), who cannot if he is humble and diligent, build up the church (REMARKS, B. H., A Comprehensive History of the Church Cent. I, Vol. VI, page 502).\nTo bring about this sweep of stakes called for sacrifice and unselfish efforts on the part of the people of the Church everywhere. Filled with the zeal of the restored gospel, hundreds of saints found themselves on their way to the tops of the mountains. The country was wide and the stretch of sky distant. There would be room for all in this land God had prepared. As fast as sufficient numbers could gather, they were sent to colonize the fertile valleys in the domain rimmed round with majestic mountains. With each group went the organizing power of the priesthood to lead in the work of salvation:\n... Arise and shine forth, said the Lord, that thy light may be a standard for the nations. And that the gathering together of my saints may continue upon her stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth (Doc. and Cov. 115:5-6).\nBooks could be filled with the colorful stories that came to pass with the early fulfillment of these words. To relate but a few connected with the conquering of the intermountain region may stimulate the desire of the reader to hunt more such human-interest stories of the settlement of the West.\nOne cold January in 1878 where the turbulent waters of the Colorado River cut down through the solid rock below Lee's Ferry, a party of saints under the leadership of John W. Young lined the banks of the stream for a crossing into Arizona. Elder Young was on his way to organize the first stake of Zion there. The barrier of these waters called for sober judgment. More than one adventurer had lost his life in the whirling rapids that washed the canyon walls. But, as though by divine providence, the day the group arrived a bridge of solid ice spanned the danger zone. While the grip of winter held, the party could pass. First, the driven cattle were thrown, their legs roped, and then they were dragged sled-like over the slippery surface of the frozen river. Heavy wagons followed, often carrying 2,500 pounds or more. One ox was lost, being dragged by the chain of loaded oxen that followed their way into the sun-striped cactus\nwater at a wider place in the river where the ice had broken.\nThe colonizers continued to come several days after Elder Young and his party had made a successful crossing. Some distance above, at Lee's Ferry, Elder Anthony W. Ivins remained to help these saints across. He made the trip by ferry some thirty-two times.\nAmong the stories of Arizona's colonization is that of the Mormon Battalion and one of its men, Lot Smith. This soldier and elder later became the first stake president in Arizona. As his first counselor he chose Jacob Hamblin, who was known as the \"apostle to the Lamanites\" and \"Leatherstocking of the Southwest.\" President Brigham Young instructed this understand-ing elder to feed and not fight his Indian brothers. In order to reach and own, Elder Hamblin often was forced to live on pine nuts. One time he killed crows for his food while on a preaching mission. He became known as a true friend to the Indians because they learned he never spoke with a \"forked tongue.\"\nAs a member of the presidency of the Little Colorado Stake in Arizona, his kindness and understanding did much to make life enjoyable for the saints who lived the United Order in those communities. A bell called the group together night and morning for songs and prayers and often words of counsel from the brethren. Their work was done in common together. The crossing at Lee's Ferry by the handful of Mormon colonizers in 1878 was but a beginning of hundreds of such migrations made by the saints on their way westward and their way into the sun-striped cactus lands of New Mexico; some pressed on across the arid wastes of Nevada; some braved the biting winds and snow of Idaho and Wyoming; and yet others scaled the rugged Rockies eastward into Colorado. The Rocky Mountain prophecy of Joseph Smith given that August day in 1842, while in his hand he held a cool glass of water that suggested. To him the clear streams of the West, was literally being fulfilled. Intrepid Mormon pioneers played a major role in bringing to pass his words, and in first setting the American flag in the majority of the intermountain states (Children's Friend, \"The Stakes of Zion? April 1942). Since those early years of establishing the first stakes of Zion, there has been a steady and impressive growth of these ecclesiastical divisions of the Church. Zion has truly touched both shores of the United States, and enlarged her borders to include parts of Canada, Mexico, and an isle of the sea. At the close of the year 1940 there were 133 stakes of Zion, 1,055 wards, 92 independent branches and 24 dependent branches in the stakes. All the European missions were under the direction of local Elders and were carrying on with marked success under the stress and hardships occasioned by the great war. There were in the stakes of Zion 86,432 men and boys holding the Aaronic Priesthood and in the missions 15,547. There were also in the stakes 95,625 men holding the Melchizedek Priesthood and 9,730 in the missions. The proclamation of the Gospel had been made in nearly all parts of the earth and had been brought to the attention of kings, presidents, potentates and rulers. At the close of this year (1940) there were many signs given spoken of by our Lord as presaging his second coming [Essentials in Church History, page 647). Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word.\" 1. How literally have the saints taken the words of the Lord, \"... Ye shall build up my church in every region\" (Doc. And Gov. 42:8)? Make a study of the points of early colonization from Salt Lake Valley. See the map for Church History series found in July 1944 issue of TheAlso study the \"Stakes of Zion\" pages 679-683, Essentials in Church History. Are there any family names found on this list known to any of your class members? If so, what stories can such a member relate concerning the person or persons named? For additional facts of interest concerning the early years when the saints struggled to build up the stakes of Zion, read chapters 41 and 42, Essentials in Church History. Also see \"The Stakes of Zion,\" in the Children's Friend, issues for February through June 1942. The articles for March and April are especially recommended for the lesson. As one approaches Idaho Falls, an increasing beauty of panorama of mountains and city meets the eye. The fertile Snake River Valley, with its golden fields of wheat, and potato fields browned by the recent frosts, stretches out to the north. The great river of history and romance comes winding its way to the Columbia, and enchanted with this scene of beauty, you find yourself at the gates of the temple....

Bennion For Tuesday, February 5, 1946 Objective: To show how charity is tactful and courteous because it is inspired by a reverence for life. Jesus went unto the mount of Olives... And all the people came unto him... And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery;... They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? This they said, tempting him, that, they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one... And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst... He said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said. No man. Lord. And Jesus said unto her. Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more (John 8:1-11). This incident offers an interesting study in contrasting attitudes. The scribes and Pharisees were thinking of the law, of punishment, of tempting Jesus, and had no feeling for the inner life of the woman. Jesus believed in the law of chastity and even enriched its meaning (note Matt. 5:27-28), but he also had reverence for the soul of the woman. He replaced her shame with hope and faith. He handled the situation with tact and graciousness. Even after the multitude left he asked her no personal questions, but simply, \"Where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?\" Think of the hope, love, and gratitude she must have felt as she left with his gracious words to cherish in her memory: \"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\" (Notice, however, that he did not say, \"Thy sin be forgiven thee.\") Charity has a deep reverence for life and expresses itself with tact and courtesy so that it will not embarrass nor offend nor give pain to an already wounded spirit. A charitable person gives in such a way that the recipient is hardly aware of the distinction between giver and receiver. There is a gentle, quiet, spontaneous, courteous way of giving which is wholly uplifting in its effect. The secret of developing this type of charity is to keep in mind, not the giver nor the gift, but the need and joy of the person who is to be the recipient of one's love and good will. \"Charity doth not behave itself unseemly.\" Literature The Bible in Our Literature. Lesson 5?Bible Influence as Revealed in Our Drama Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, February 19, 1946 ENGLISH drama had its beginnings in religion. After plays and pageantry had been banned for centuries because of the vileness to which they had sunk in fallen Rome, the priests began to introduce dramatic elements into church ritual. A simple portrayal of the story of the resurrection or of the angel and the shepherds and the coming of the wise men, might be given as part of the commemorative ceremonies of Easter and of Christmas. Other significant stories from the Bible also might be portrayed?all to bring the scriptures closer to the common folk. What began thus simply with the priests, gradually developed into more elaborate dramatic presentations. A calendar of holy days set by the church opened the way for remembering various events in the life of Jesus at different times of the year. Laymen, as well as priests, began to take part in these religious plays and many of them were performed outside the church. They offered recreation to help lighten the so-called Dark Ages. With the nearing of the Renaissance came other developments. Miracle plays, depicting legends connected with the saints, began to appear; with them came the moralities, or moral plays, in which the various virtues and vices were allegorically presented. In time, these dramas, intended to impress truth and righteous living, were given in the common language of the folk, and performed largely apart from the church. Then groups of \"strollers,\" or wandering actors, would take the plays from village to village or castle to castle. Such a troupe of players, as many will remember, is employed by Hamlet when he would prove the king guilty of the crime that Hamlet feels he has committed. Naturally, with the gradual separation of the drama from church ceremonies, there came other than just religious themes into it. Expansion and development of the histrionic art, following the Crusades and the discovery of America, brought a \"Golden Age\" of play writing and play acting, especially to England. During the long reign of Elizabeth, the theatre flourished, and plays unsurpassed in dramatic and literary art were created. Those were days, remember, when the drama to succeed had to stand on its own merits. There were no such accessories as electric lights to flash rainbow effects round the players; no scenic settings nor music to accord with the varying emotions stirred by the play. Theatres, on the contrary, were rather crude affairs with a platform on which the actors played their parts. Below them, standing \"in the pit,\" were the common folk; above, in circular rows of stalls, were the lords and ladies or other people of means who could afford seats. It took drama of gripping appeal to hold such an audience.\nOne playwright and producer who took the challenge in such a situation and succeeded marvelously was William Shakespeare. Not a great deal is surely known of his earlier life. He certainly must have grown up with the drama?probably taking active part in his younger days with strolling players, and helping to shape the plays themselves as he went from place to place. Some basic training such as this, added to his superb natural talent, gave him the wit and wisdom and the art that have made him the greatest dramatist of all time. That he has held the highest place is attested by the fact that for decades hardly a year has gone by without seeing his name on Broadway; and the further fact that thousands upon thousands of students are taught his plays year after year as the finest examples of drama ever created. They live for all time.\nSomething even deeper than mere genius must explain this phenomenon in literature. Quests to learn the inner secret of his art?and thousands upon thousands through the years have made the search?are about as conclusive as the efforts to learn how the firefly gives its light, or why the skylark rises to heaven when it sings. This, how-\never, we do know of Shakespeare: he did create plays, a good many of them, that have brought stirring and uplifting entertainment to humanity through centuries. He has left mankind both thrilled and thinking.\nMay the writer be pardoned here the telling of a personal experience. His first real contact with Shakespeare came at a Saturday afternoon performance in the old Salt Lake Theater. Julius Caesar was the play. This youth sat entranced for two hours?and came out different. He bought a copy of the play, and for weeks thereafter was studying and reciting its lines. It was the beginning of a lasting love for great drama, and the setting of a helpful standard of appreciation.\nNot long after that experience he saw another play in the same old theater, Gismonda, it was called. There were thrills aplenty in the colorful drama, with one of America's leading actresses of the day in the stellar role. It gave stirring entertainment, but not re-creation. There was no running out to buy the play, no reciting of lines ringing of truth such as these:\n... lowliness is young ambition's ladder.\n\nCowards die many times before their deaths;\nThe valiant never taste of death but once.\n\nHis life was gentle, and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand Up and say to all the world, \"This was a man.\"\n?Julius Caesar\nShakespeare had the skill to portray life?outward and inward life; to create scenes that move and stir the heart and leave the mind informed. In Julius Caesar we have Brutus, the man of honor, the idealist, made a prey by scheming politicians. In this, as in all the best of Shakespeare's plays, w6 have situations, scenes, characters that are true to life for all ages. More than this, with unforgettable lines, this master voices truth for all time. There is no preaching of religion, yet in his plays sin does not triumph, but good is the victor even though the story ends in tragedy. Bible influence may always be felt and often seen in his words and lines and allusions to Holy Writ. Just a few illustrative excerpts will add concreteness here: The quality of mercy is not strained, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice bless'd: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. ?Merchant of Venice *o 4 O, how wretched Is that poor man that hangs on princes favors: And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer, Never to hope again, ?King Henry VIII Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king, he would not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies. ?King Henry VII Act I This above all: to thine own self be true. And it must follow as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. ?Ham Jet, Act I Shakespeare's plays, like Milton's epics, and like the Bible, deal with searching problems of life. They reveal sin in its ugliness, but only as a darker background against which virtue and nobility may be more impressively portrayed. His purpose, like that of all high-minded artists, is to inspire a love of the good, the beautiful, and the true. In all this he is in perfect accord with the Bible whether that source of inspiration is revealed openly or not. Successful dramatists since those days of Elizabeth, have followed the basic pattern set by the Bard of Avon. Directly and indirectly their best plays reveal Bible influence. Generally it is to be felt only in the spirit of the play as it vibrates in the scenes and in characters of noble, of lovable qualities. Outwardly it is shown in allusions and quoted lines from scripture. Occasionally, the theme may be taken from the Bible, or, as in the Passion Plays of Oberammergau, it may faithfully portray characters and scenes of Holy Writ. Within recent years the Bible story has been presented rather elaborately in pageantry and moving pictures. One such performance was \"The Eternal Road,\" which was short-lived. Another, ?The Ten Commandments,\" portrayed the story of the escape of Israel from Egypt, the giving of the Commandments to Moses, and then applied all this in a modern drama. Will Rogers, after seeing this play, remarked, \"It is easy to see where God left off in the play, and the movie-picture man began.\" The spectacle again was short-lived. People seem not to like to have the Bible preached at them, particularly in shows. A Biblical play of comparatively recent creation, which had a longer run\" was \"Green Pastures.\" LESSON DEPARTMENT 703 It was, as the author says, \"an attempt to portray a living religion in terms of its believers.\" In this case, the believers were negroes of the Deep South, who with \"spiritual hunger and true humility\" have adapted the Bible to their everyday lives. Sincerity and reverence, such as one feels in the truly Negro spirituals, vibrate through the literal words, scenes, and characters portrayed. The play recalls lines from Longfellow's Hiawatha: Feeble hands and helpless Groping blindly in the darkness Touch God's right hand in that darkness And are lifted up and strengthened. Plays of the above literal type are not often presented. What usually is seen in the theater is just shows, dealing with folk in all their typical problems and life situations. Among the welter of these presented on the stage, in the photoplays, and over the radio, earnest search must be made constantly to find the few that do bring recreational uplift. It is not unlike digging for gold-one must generally shovel and wash away a ton of sand and gravel to get a nugget. Each one will doubtless recall some play or plays which have been like precious nuggets. Tastes differ, of course, in the drama as well as in other kinds of art. Yet, in the essentials, the play that wins and holds our hearts leaves a clean, wholesome aftermath. It may have been just for entertainment, but as such it brought pure joy and uplift. It may have presented more serious aspects of life; yet it left the audience with new strength and faith in man and God. It is only such dramas that are worth time. Everyone reading these lines will probably begin to list in mind plays that measure up to these standards. No two of these lists would be exactly alike, but that is immaterial. One the writer keeps in treasured memory is Maeterlinck's The Bluebird. It was an enriching experience to follow the two children on their quest for the bluebird, happiness, only at last to find it in their own home. Barrie's Peter Pan, as Maude Adams brought it to us, was another delight?just a sweet little story portraying the joyous, imaginative life of youth. More recently Sherwood's Abe Lincoln in Illinois with Raymond Massey in the title role brought audiences close to the real Lincoln during his developing years. \"Honest Abe\" speaks to our hearts through the lines. The Bible influence in his life can be felt; it radiates impressively in the beautiful prayer he made for the recovery of the little pioneer boy (see, page 577), and during other dramatic moments of the story. Another heart-lifting play, portraying the life of a great woman, who, with Lincoln, gave her best to help free the slaves, is Harriet. In this convincing drama, recently presented on Broadway with Helen Hayes in the part of the heroine, we are brought closer to the life of Harriet Beecher Stowe, and made to feel her masterful contribution to a challenging cause. Historical drama, provided it is created and acted with artistry, often rises to the highest in dramatic art. One of the leaders in the field of drama, a successful director of plays, an actor with talent as well as a scholar, was asked lately to name one or more current plays that stand out as great drama. \"I regret,? was his reply, \"that none I know of deserve that distinction except Shakespeare's Tempest/ now being played on Broadway, and the real play there is being obscured by too many scenic effects, too much light and music.\" \"Of course,\" he continued, \"we do have several clever light operas and other shows, good, bad and indifferent, which are gathering the crowds. Performances of this sort come and go all the time. They offer passing entertainment, but not recreational uplift.\" \"Might not a little more Biblical influence in the modern drama be of help in getting plays of lasting worth?\" came another question. ?Yes, if it is woven into the play with artistry. Remember, a drama to get and hold an audience, must be good entertainment, first of all. It may be such, as the masters have shown, and yet through fine character portrayal, and natural gripping dialogue, vital life lessons can be impressed. We need more of such upbuilding plays.\" \"How can we get them?\" \"Well, concerted action on the part of home, church, and school to educate young and old away from what Shakespeare would call \"dumb shows and noise,\" might: help. More good oral reading in the home, more community dramatics, more literary recitals would promote a taste for a higher type of drama than we are now wasting time and money to hear. As with music, this taste must be cultivated. Those who have control over the radio, the moving pictures, and the theater would, I believe, respond helpfully to such united effort for uplift.\" This leader's comments will have a familiar ring to Latter-day Saints. From pioneer days our people have been taught that every pure enjoyment is from the Lord, and that it is the abuse, not the proper use of such delightful means of entertainment as the drama, that constitutes evil. Wholesome plays have been encouraged for relaxation and recreation, to help us keep our elasticity and to renew our vigor for the sterner drama of life. Now, with allurements of commercialized entertainment in varied forms, there comes a new challenge to every home. A positive way to meet this challenge is to fight fire with fire. The love of uplifting drama, like the love of good music, begins at the hearthside. Mothers and fathers can begin the work and get closer to the hearts of their children through playing stories with them, by helping them get the best out of radio programs and photoplays. It is natural to carry forward these home joys into the encouragement of home dramatics. There should be more earnest group study of the drama by parents and teachers with the purpose of finding plays that are Bible inspired, that promote a love for the good, the beautiful, the true. Concerted effort not only to cultivate appreciation for the highest and best in the drama, but to have it produced on the stage and screen and over the radio, should bring richer, more uplifting returns for all.

Christensen For Tuesday, February 26, 1946 Lesson link: It was shown last time that there is a fundamental relationship between certain leisure-time activities and immoral conduct. The rise of abundant leisure for all classes during this machine age has presented mankind with both an opportunity and a responsibility. But too often leisure time is wasted in idleness or dissipated in debauchery, so that the opportunity it affords is lost and the responsibility it implies is ignored; too often \"wreck-reation\" crowds out real recreation. Suggestions were made for improving this situation by individual, family, and community effort. Lesson aim: To analyze some of the social and moral problems peculiar to women in this modern world, and to emphasize woman's moral role and responsibility in the field of ethics. \nALTHOUGH the number of women in the world, under normal conditions, is just about equal to the number of men, the moral influence that they wield is probably much greater. This is because of two special advantages that women have over men in this respect: (1) Their position as mothers puts them closer to the developing child during his most impressionable years, which means that women have more to do with the building of character and the shaping of personality than do men. (2) Their womanly charm, or \"sex appeal\" as it is sometimes called, gives them a tremendous power and advantage over the male who, in respect to some of the follies of the flesh, might more accurately than women be called \"the weaker sex.\"\nBut since every opportunity rightfully carries with it a moral responsibility, it is well to ask if women are using this special power which is theirs to good advantage or are turning it to their own selfish use. Are the women of today being good mothers, wives and sweethearts, true to the moral obligations implicit in these roles, or are they using their position and turning their opportunity to their own personal and selfish advantage? Some of each, no doubt, but enough of the latter to invoke real alarm and serious concern. It is primarily to mothers and the sweethearts of\nmen that we must look for the balance and guidance in morals so sorely needed in the world today.\nBefore attempting any criticism of contemporary womanly conduct, however, it will be well to try to understand the modern woman in the light of recent social trends. So great have been these changes in society that many women today find themselves confused or lost, not even understanding themselves. And to make matters worse, most discussions on \"youth problems\" deal only with the boy, and most of the literature on adult delinquency is concerned mainly with the male. It is time for people to realize that the adjustment problems of girls and women in this rapidly changing world are in many ways even more difficult than those of boys and men, and to realize also that one of the keys to morality is moral womanhood.\nThe Emancipation of Women\nHistorically, woman has almost always had a role in society inferior to that of man. This is not to say that she is innately inferior or has in any way deserved such a lowly station, but only that man has seen fit to use his greater physical strength and freedom to subjugate and abuse woman for his own self-gratification. And, as a consequence, in virtually all of the dealings between man and woman, man has benefited at the expense of woman. LESSON DEPARTMENT 707 Woman, for example, at times has been confined entirely to the home, deprived of property, bought and sold like chattel, beaten, killed, et cetera; and all because she was woman. But recently in the western world the general trend has been away from all of this, toward an equality of the sexes. Politically, in America, woman can vote and hold public office as well as can man. Economically, she can find employment outside of the home and can personally control her own income and property. Socially, she can enjoy many freedoms that were formerly the prerogative of \"men only.\" Yes, woman has come a long way in her struggle for emancipation and equality. Even so, she has not yet arrived; the fight still goes on. Although there are few legal barriers keeping woman from public office, social disapproval has a very powerful restraining effect. Although woman can and does compete with man in gainful employment, she still, with a few exceptions, does not receive \"equal pay for equal work.\" Although she is more free in the various patterns of social intercourse than she' once was, she is still watched more closely and judged more harshly when she oversteps than is man. There are still laws on the statute books of our states which discriminate against woman in the fields of property, profits, and morals. In these and many other ways America still treats its women in a similar manner to its racial minority groups, nominally equal under the assumption of democracy but actually inferior in the roles they are permitted to play. Some Consequences One of the unfortunate accompaniments of this equality trend is the tendency on the part of some women to mistake identity for equality. In their zeal for freedom many have deserted entirely their feminine roles and charms in order to better compete. They ape men in dress, in speech, in mannerisms; they prepare for and engage in the traditionally masculine jobs; they become coarse, crude, and vulgar. This masculinization of woman cannot help but lead to trouble for it is a perversion of the very nature of things. Since men and women are inherently different biologically, it is well also to expect personalities and social roles of the two sexes to be differentiated. The personal and social relationships of men and women should be supplementary and complementary rather than duplicative; co-operative rather than competitive. Equality is highly desirable, but equality does not require identity. It is entirely possible for men and women to be equal and still be different; they can be equal, each within his own field. An unfortunate consequence of this trend toward equality is the development of extreme individualism and independence on the part of some women, an independence so strong that it ignores responsibility and precludes co-operation. This is not to say that woman should necessarily be more dependent than man, but neither more independent. As woman finds her rightful place side by side with man, the masculine ego will have to adjust somewhat, and rightly so. But let the woman who is wise be neither too impatient nor too aggressive. Arguing, being obstinate, making demands, acting independently, fighting?these do not make one equal or free. Equality is more than the assertion of equality. The question of a career versus a home and family is often difficult for some women to decide. And there is no one answer that will apply in all cases. Some women are successful in having both; either stopping for a short career before starting a family, or fitting it in along with the family, or settling down to a career after the family has been reared. All of these arrangements present difficulties, but the last named is most likely to succeed. Some women choose a career in preference to a family; and some, without any real opportunity for marriage, turn to a career as a second choice or a substitute. A great many women wisely look upon homemaking as a career and, by focusing attention and energy upon their responsibilities as wives and mothers, are able to make the greatest contributions to the moral welfare of society that it is possible for woman to make. Motherhood is the one function that is reserved exclusively for women, and yet, in their scurry for recognition and equality, many are deserting or neglecting even that. Employment and career activities outside of the home are justifiable if they can be successfully fitted in to a happy home life, but for every normal woman the home and family should come first. Men and women should be equal, but it should be a differentiated equality; both sexes should be free, but it should be a responsible freedom; women should be active and creative in their own right, but it should be a co-operative individualism that spurs them on. The Prostitution of Womanhood There are a great many women in this modern world who want the freedom that equality promises without accepting the obligations entailed. They seek for special privileges, for rights without responsibilities; and in order to obtain them they are ever ready to prostitute their virtue, to sell their birthright for a \"mess of pottage.\" Figuratively speaking, they want to have their cake and eat it too. But the idea itself is as wrong as are the selfish and sometimes cowardly methods used to try to bring it about. There is a basic difference between the emotional nature of men and women, a difference that should be well understood if the moral issue we are here talking about is to be recognized. Sex passion is natural and real for both sexes; but with the male it is more elementary, more constant, more easily aroused. Women's sex nature is more complex, more involved with the emotional and mental processes, more easily controlled. This difference helps explain why man is more frequently the aggressor, and the offender, in the field of sex. It also explains why woman's influence is so profound in the lives of men. There is nothing that can contribute to a man's stability and success like a good woman; and conversely, there is nothing that can contribute to his downfall like a bad woman. LESSON DEPARTMENT 709 Man, then, in some ways is weak, weak where woman is strong; and he needs the strength of woman to help him through. But, unfortunately, there are those women who are willing to use sex selfishly, use it as a power device for control over men, use it as a weapon to fight for selfish advantage. Here are some of the ways: (1) They resort to flattery, coquetry, and deceit to lead man on. (2) They cry when they don't get their own way, or otherwise appeal to the man's affection or gallantry in order to control him. (3) They wear clothes which accentuate the anatomical features peculiar to their sex, and they similarly use language and actions designed for erotic suggestion and stimulation. Sometimes these things are done innocently, with a simple desire for attention from the elusive male. If so, the girl may wonder why masculine eyes follow her down the street or why her partner becomes so amorous. But other times it is done deliberately, with the cause and effect relationships well understood. (4) They \"gold dig\" in courtship, offering favors in intimacy as payment for the money spent; or they marry for money, exchanging sexual favors for a life of leisure and luxury. (5) They enter commercialized prostitution, or they engage in one of the various sexual rackets whereby they seek to extort money from respectable citizens by threatening to smear their names. It is only this last category that is commonly referred to as prostitution; but actually all of these ways in which womanhood is used to unfair advantage could logically be so called, for in all of them virtue and right are \"sold\" for selfish advantage. Women, too, often leave their natural personalities relatively undeveloped and rely simply upon sex or physical charm to attract men. This is a mistake, for while it gets attention it certainly does not get respect, and after a time even attention is lost. Great women are those who, through the attainment of social and emotional maturity, demonstrate their greatness by the very dignity and power of their personalities. No need for them to quibble about equality or to let down moral standards in order to get along in the world. Conclusions Although the emancipation of woman has confused woman's social roles and led to some moral blundering and considerable exploitation, it has also cleared the ground and laid the foundation for a better world. Woman of today, for the first time in history, has the real opportunity of being man's partner rather than his servant or his slave. Equality for woman is in sight, but if it is taken as mere license it will become a liability rather than an opportunity. Woman's standards of morality are still higher than those of man. Man still looks up to good women for guidance and strength and inspiration. May the time never come when this ceases to be, for man needs the tempering and chastening effect of wholesome womanhood. Woman has a particular moral mission to perform in the world today, a unique opportunity, a deep responsibility. May she not fail! Problems for Thought and Action 1. Do you agree that women wield a greater moral influence in the world than do men? What two advantages do women have in this respect? Elaborate each. Is the problem of adjusting to the changing world as difficult for women as for men? Discuss pro and con. 2. What is meant by the emancipation of woman? From your knowledge of history give examples of the low status of women in earlier societies. Trace the woman's rights movement in this country. Give present day examples of woman's inequality. Do you think she will ever be entirely equal with man? J. Show how the equality trend has often meant the masculinization of woman. Criticize this tendency. Show how some women mistake license for freedom. Criticize. Contrast the double and single standards of morality and show in which direction society is moving. Defend the single standard and discuss ways of obtaining it without lowering morals. How has the emancipation of woman sometimes resulted in the development of extreme independence and individualism? Evaluate this tendency. Analyze the problem of careers for women. Why should the home come first? 4. What is meant by the prostitution of womanhood? Show how the emotional natures of men and women differ. Why does this fact give woman a special moral opportunity and responsibility? What is a great woman? Why do so many women fail to reach real greatness? Selected References Standard Works: Bible: Proverbs 11:22; 31:10-31. Writings by L. D. S.

Henderson I watch the tide come in on Monterey Bay? The tide come in from the ocean gray; It surges and leaps up over the land, Then slowly recedes with its burden of sand; But the tide leaves the seaweed, the jellyfish, crab-In colors of rose-pink, white, dark green, and drab, And there's beauty in some beyond words to compare In the sea dollar's star and the clamshell rare. Some are fragments, broken and torn apart. Mute tokens of beauty in nature's lost art; They are left on the beach where we frolic and play Wlien the tide has gone out on Monterey Bay. Is the tide like our lives from some ocean beyond. Fathomless, deathless, going eternally on. Each wave a new life as it breaks on the surf And contributes its bit?good or bad?to the earth? Some lives are mere symbols of what might have been. And others are wrecked by their burden of sin, But some lives there are with a perfect design Like my sea dollar's star, my clam's luster and Tine. They have given their best, be it great, be it small. And unselfishly served for the good of us all; When their tides go out and their sands slip away.

            "content": "The Gospel in the Relief Society Educational Program\nElder Howard R. Driggs\nI HAVE never faced in all my life so many good and beautiful women. It is an honor and privilege to stand before you, and I humbly pray to God to help me to say those things that will lift us all to higher levels as I am lifted this morning by this occasion. The keynote of what I should like to say is to be found in a song we all love to sing, \"Thanks for our teachers who labor with care, that we in the light of the gospel may shine.\" No other word occurs more frequently or is echoed more beautifully throughout all our scriptures than the word \"light.\" The Savior said, \"I am the light and the life,\" and he advised us to let our\nlight so shine that a man seeing our good deeds would glorify God, who is in heaven.\nIf the teacher has one purpose above another, it is to radiate light. It is to illumine truth; it is to lead souls out of the darkness into the light. I think no more beautiful story has ever come to me as to the real work of the teacher than that found in the life story of Helen Keller. As a little girl, Helen Keller enjoyed one brief period of sunshine, of flowers, of bird song, of home joys. Then, suddenly, through dread illness, she was plunged, by being bereft of sight and hearing, into what she called \"a prison house of darkness.\" GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 733 As she came back to consciousness out of that disease, she said she was beating the bars of that physical prison, trying to get back into the light. Yet in that darkness, she might have remained, \"had not she come, my teacher, who was to set my spirit free/' Anna Suhi-van, a devoted, understanding, loving teacher, took that little human soul and led her back into the sunshine. She placed in her hands, literally, the key of language to open the prison house. She brought her forth into glorious womanhood, where she could make her contribution magnificently to the world. Every one of US is a teacher, either by example or precept, or both. Every human being is teaching other human beings. It is true that officers and teachers of great organizations such as this are called especially to the privilege. That doesn't take away the duty and the opportunity of everyone of us to lead souls into the light. This is especially true of gospel teachers. Our constant effort should be to make the world brighter, not only today but for all time. We should ever remember this, that so far as the teaching, of the gospel is concerned, the spirit of the gospel is \"caught,\" rather than \"taught.\" One cannot impart the spirit of the gospel by mere words or by a recital of facts. What is in you radiates from you. The Apostle Paul called our attention to this very picturesquely when he said, \"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\" We carry the spirit of the gospel with us, or we do not. If we carry it with us, those around us catch the light of our illumination. It matters not whether we represent an arc light or one of less candle power, our business is to light up the dark corners where we happen to be. Dear old Dr. Maeser, with whom I was privileged to associate in the long ago years, said this once to a class of teachers in training: \"You can't teach even arithmetic most successfully unless you radiate something of the spirit of the gospel.\" It is a challenging assertion, but it is true. Oh, of course there are teachers who seem to radiate little or none of the spirit of the gospel, but they would do better with that spirit, and they are always excelled by those teachers who combine intellect and spirituality. NOW, to your educational program. The Relief Society, in its marvelous way, has spread before its members and its officers and all the world, a well-rounded program touching the various phases of basic life. Every lesson that you teach goes to its highest level only when it is taught with a testimony of the gospel in your hearts. Even in your work meetings, where, with nimble fingers, sisters gather around a quilt and begin to sew, and generally to talk, if the spirit of the gospel is not in that spontaneous expression and in the hearts of those who are doing the work, there is something of vital worth lacking. Many a lesson in gospel service is lastingly impressed by those who scatter sunshine and uplifting thoughts while they work. Apply the same truth to your lessons in Church history. In this study one should keep the mind on the final outcomes and not be led into things of little consequence.\nWhen I was a boy I was brought into this temple yard. On an excursion from Pleasant Grove and West Jordan, some of us school children were privileged to come here and see the temple which was being built. It wasn't up to the square. We were permitted to climb the winding stairs to the top and look over the city. One thing I remember was that this yard was littered with stones, with all sorts of tools. We don't see those things now; we see the glorious temple with its spires pointing heavenward.\nEvery man's life and every woman's life in the building is likely to have some litter about it, but by what do we judge the life? by the outcome. Think of this when you teach lessons in history. Let the gospel light guide this great work.\nIn the lessons on literature recently given we started out with that found in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. The central aim of all was to bring you back to the Bible, to make you love that book of books. These courses were not planned for one year. One cannot get out the Bible in eight or sixteen lessons. They were planned to lay a firm foundation for reading and rereading and enjoying the Bible. With that work as a basis and as a standard, we are now entering upon the study of the influence of the Bible and Christian teaching on our\nliterature. I think that we have here a measuring rod by which we can determine whether any literature that has been created is worthy of a place in our home libraries. A book that does not vibrate a spirit of the gospel is open to serious challenge as to whether it goes into the home or not. There is nothing narrow about this; it is soundly basic for all great literature that will be read and reread vibrates to the story of the Bible.\nParents have today the challenge, as never before, to get closer to the literature of their children. Nothing offers a better chance to get nearer to their hearts and souls than good books. We need to cultivate such a companionship in our homes.\nMay I pay tribute here to my dear mother, in closing. She made our library the center of our home, and she was ever ready to read some beautiful poem, to tell us some story. She saw to it that even though the linen closet or the china closet might not be as richly furnished as in other homes, she had good books in that room where we loved to gather.\nWe must pay more attention to the spiritual uplift of our homes. We must unite in getting better books in our homes. We must radiate the light of the gospel there.\nGod bless you in the great work you are doing, multiply and spread it, that the gospel may shine in every home in its simplicity, its purity, with its saving grace, I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. Relief Society?s Expanding Welfare Service Elder Henry D. Moyle Chairman, General Welfare Committee THIS opportunity to advance the welfare program of the Church, though unsolicited, I can assure you is nevertheless deeply appreciated. Nor do I accept this invitation without a keen realization of the responsibility resting upon me. I appreciate this kind of consideration extended me by your able Presidency. I am sure, to the extent that any of us measures up to that which is expected of him, it is due entirely to the assistance he receives from his Heavenly Father. Without the assurance that he will and does help us, many of us, of whom I know I am myself one, would find our tasks insurmountable.\nIt is with this spirit of dependence upon the Lord that we must all approach our expanding responsibility?the welfare service of the Church. We must further acknowledge our individual insufficiency in carrying on the work by exhibiting a dependence upon each other. There is none of us in this Church so good or great or endowed with power sufficient to magnify his office and calling in the Church without receiving much assistance and in many ways?from his brethren and sisters in the wards and stakes of the Church in which he lives and works.\nWelfare work is no exception to this well-established rule, which we might call \"the rule of dependency\" of the Church. That which I say is, of course, auxiliary to the priest-\nhood, not to any quorum in particular, but to all quorums equally. Our spiritual and temporal welfare is so closely interwoven, there can be no clear line of demarcation between the two. No one can say the Relief Society takes care of either spiritual or temporal or secular? and not both. Every visit made by a Relief Society teacher, every class held, inspires someone to live nearer the Maker, and, at the same time, prepares that same person to take better care of herself and of her family temporally.\nSo we arrive at the first conclusion in projecting our welfare program into the future, and that is a complete organization is an absolute necessity. By this I mean we must first have a Relief Society fully officered and organized and functioning. Second, a welfare committee in each stake and ward on which the Relief Society presidency of the stake and ward are personally and actively represented. When this is the case, the stake Relief Society comes in direct contact each month with the president of the stake and the presidents of the various priesthood quorums, as well as the stake work directors, and the ward Relief Society meets each week with the bishop and the representatives of the priesthood quorums in the ward and the ward work directors, and, at this meeting, should become intimately familiar with the details of the welfare work of the ward and the needs of the membership, and it is at this meeting that they are assigned their duties and responsibilities for the coming month.\nOUR basic problem in taking care of our own, as most of you know, is to render each family in the Church able to care for its own. We have perfected, to a marvelous degree, the production of the welfare budget. It is a pleasure for me to report to you all in time that the record of the Relief Society as an organization in assisting to produce this budget has not only been active in producing the budget, but has helped more than any other single agency in the Church to see to it that the budget, to the extent that it has been distributed, has reached those who needed it. I know of no failure, in the Church, of the Relief Society to promptly and adequately do that which they have been commissioned to do by their bishops since the inception of our welfare program. I am sure your future is to do more. We must increase materially our distribution.\nYou sisters appreciate that in planning for the welfare of the Church, we must produce more than we distribute in order to provide a surplus from which we can momentarily draw in case of a sudden or unexpected turn of events. It is, however, important while securing this insurance that we do not overlook these needs may not be apparent. By so doing we perform more fully our present responsibility and we are, at the same time, able to determine more accurately the extent to which, in the Church, we can better develop means and\nmethods of distribution, and in every other way fit and prepare and qualify ourselves to more adequately carry on our work in the future, and, above all, to more fully meet promptly any emergency. This, after all, is the best form of insurance of which we can conceive.\nTHE welfare work, as originally announced by the First Presidency, divides itself into four major subdivisions. We have thus far discussed the first general subdivision, that of temporary relief, involving, as has been suggested, the production and distribution of the budget. The second general subdivision deals with the permanent security of the members of the Church. A simple illustration suffices to bring out clearly the distinction between these two major phases of our work. A member in need can be given an order on the bishops' storehouse. This is temporary relief just as our budgets are temporary. They must be renewed every year to meet the temporary needs of that current year. It may be possible, however, to find this same needy member employment, and then we have solved his problem and removed the necessity for any temporary relief, and this latter we call permanent security.\nUnquestionably, with the termination of hostilities in the world, the finding of employment and thus readjusting the lives of these, our brothers and sisters, whose lives were thrown out of adjustment by the war, is a real major problem. Before this problem has been successfully met, the Relief Society will no doubt have played a most important role in its ultimate solution. I commend this problem to you as one which justifies and calls for the best there is in the Relief Society.\nTo meet this problem, as well as all other problems that arise in the welfare program, the Church looks to the family for the final solution. If families cannot succeed in making each of their individual members self-sustaining through the united effort of all, there is little hope that any outside agency could add much toward any permanent solution of that individual's problem. As a matter of fact, it is natural for the family to always have some members dependent upon it. That's what families are for. The father and mother are dependent upon each other. It is to be hoped we shall always have children in our homes, and so long as we have children we shall have a family rather than an individual problem.\nI WANT to go one step further and say that I hope we always have parents and grandparents in our homes, and, so long as we do, their problems as well as the problems of the children, are and should be the problems of the family. Up to date, at least, in Latter-day Saint homes, we have undertaken to provide in our homes for all members of our family, be they old or young. There has never been any difference in the nation made for spiritual guidance. We depend upon the priesthood of the father as the head of the family, assisted by his sons who may hold the priesthood. We unite the family daily in family prayer, we pray unitedly for the support, maintenance, welfare, spirituality and temporal progress we undertake to take in the family circle to direct\nthe footsteps of our children and to make the family influence predominate in the child's life, and expect the early training to be followed throughout life. The children in the Church, as they grow to maturity, reflect in their lives the teachings of their mother and father in the family. You mothers in Israel must continue to do your part. As a people, we must never be willing to give to another the rearing of our children.\nSome say it is proper for the government to raise our families, send them to school, etc., because some of us pay taxes, or for some other equally absurd reason. We do not pay taxes for the purpose of having other people raise our children or care for our elderly people. If this were the reason for taxes, we might all very well keep our money and do the job ourselves without paying a large proportion of the sums used for that purpose for professional services.\nAs Latter-day Saints, we believe without any question that to destroy family responsibility is to destroy the family, and with the family destroyed, the Church would be gone. No church on earth claims for the family what we claim. The restoration of the gospel in this dispensation included the appearance of Elijah before the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple on the third day of April, 1836, in fulfillment of the prophecy of Malachi, \"to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse.\"\nWe can hardly say that our hearts often go to the cradles of our children or that our children's hearts have been turned toward us, if we are in the frame of mind which permits us to share in any way, shape, or form the responsibility of parenthood with the world or any of its agencies, and if this be true it follows as a necessary corollary that our children cannot prepare themselves for full fellowship in the Church or magnify their offices and callings in the priesthood if they shirk their responsibility toward their parents, or share it in ever so small a way with the world.\nMay I ask: Can we love our mothers and leave the determination of their needs to laws or strangers, and the provision of these needs to the unearthliness and insecurities of the world? A few years ago, no one of us would have thought in this Church of favoring a law which relieved the mothers of support of the children. However, there are bills in Congress today, in the Congress of the United States, that look toward giving the mothers assistance for their children, without any relationship to need. In other words, any mother, if these laws were passed, as they have been passed in other countries, would be assisted by the government. The government does not recognize the father as the head of the family for obvious reasons. Dealing with the mother, the question of legitimacy or illegitimacy of the children involved need not be questioned. Need we say more?\nThe question might be put rather bluntly and boldly in these words: Do we as a people so far worship money that we are willing to the slightest degree to relinquish parental control of our children for gold?\nIn projecting the ever-expanding welfare program of the Church, we call upon the Relief Society as an organization and all of its members individually in faith and humility to answer these questions directly, and to be a direct influence in our own families for maintaining family unity, family integrity, family faith, and family loyalty to the ways of the Lord.\nThe Relief Society, like all other organizations in the Church, is confronted with the necessity of converting our saints to the simple fundamental principles of life and of truth everlasting, and to avoid the conflicting philosophies and theories of men in the world. To accomplish this purpose is to accomplish the purposes of the welfare program. We must gather Israel to the standards of our Lord.\nNeed we say that to be married for time and eternity in the house of the Lord by the priesthood is but the first step in the eternal scheme of family progression? The first step becomes as naught if we fail to continue to go forward in righteousness, maintaining the sacred relationship of family life and assuming all the responsibilities incident thereto throughout life, as we hope to do throughout eternity.\nThe Relief Society can and will, I am sure, expand its service so far as necessary to keep our brethren and sisters in the fold and to give to the priesthood of the Church the kind of an example and the encouragement through love and affection which will induce them to fully magnify their position in the family and in the Church; and that this may be our happy lot, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Relief Society Leadership President Amy Brown Lyman THE type of leadership which the Relief Society wishes to develop is the type which Jesus exemplified when he said, \"I am among you as one that serveth\" (Luke 22:27). In this same verse he says that it is greater to serve than to be served.\nThe service to which he dedicated his life was a service of unselfishness, self-sacrifice, and helpfulness. It was divinely inspired, was born of brotherly love, and safeguarded by the conception he held of the sacredness of the human personality. It was intelligent service resulting from keen observation and long years of study and preparation, and most important of all, from divine guidance.\nIt is assumed that as a boy Jesus lived a normal, peaceful, protected life in a humble house where he was trained to labor and work and to live in the fear of the Lord. It is evident that in he grew up he became an industrious worker, a careful observer, and a profound student, that he gained much knowledge by his own effort, and through prayer and devotion to our Heavenly Father he was blessed with great wisdom. Even at the age of twelve in his interview in the temple, he astonished the learned doctors with his unusual knowledge and attainments.\nWhat a glorious example and pattern of work, observation, and inspiration for leaders and teachers was his! He was perhaps the greatest of all\nleaders and teachers, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\nThe success of any enterprise depends largely upon its leaders. It is to them that people look for guidance, encouragement and inspiration.\nRelief Society, with its many fields of activity, requires many workers and as the years go by and new avenues of service appear, new and additional workers, with new and additional preparation and experience, will be needed. Leaders are needed for executive work and for class teaching; for choral work and dramatics; for art-needlework and plain sewing; for homemaking and household management; for training for parenthood and family life; and for social welfare work. And with frequent changes in executive officers, practically all the members are called sooner or later to lead out in some activity and thus assume some responsibility.\nOne of the first requisites of Relief society leaders is to live the gospel. They should aim to be living examples of what they advocate and teach, being \"doers of the word, and not hearers only\" (James 1:22). They should conform to all the standards and requirements set for Latter-day Saints and be true to the ideals of the Church and of the gospel. They should honor and respect the priesthood and should hearken to any instructions the priesthood offers. They should practice what they preach and preach what they practice. They should cultivate spirituality and thus increase and strengthen their own testimonies and the testimonies of those whom they lead. Relief Society leaders should also seek to enhance their general scholarship and learning which will increase their ability and bear fruit in their efforts to lead and influence others. They should have some familiarity with the standard works of the Church. They should know something about the history and the background of the Church and its leaders. They should be familiar with the history, background, activities, and accomplishments of the Relief Society, and of the women who have directed its work. It is sometimes mistakenly claimed that only those who are born leaders or are born with an aptitude for leadership and teaching can succeed as leaders and teachers. Experience in Relief Society over a period of many years has demonstrated that this is not a correct conclusion and that leadership can be developed. The Society has seen women grow and develop as they have accepted calls to serve, and have sought the spirit of the Lord to guide them. It has seen women changed, yes, almost transformed through Relief Society service. Many at first too timid to take any part, have, through study and prayerful effort and practice, become resourceful, successful officers and class teachers, able conversationalists, and strong, well-poised individuals. They have learned much about how to meet life successfully, how to adjust to their environment, and how to get along and live and work with others. They have learned to be patient, tolerant, sympathetic, and understanding, and their love for humanity, which is one of the most important elements in leadership, as it is in life itself (brotherly love, if you please), has increased with the years of their service. In closing, I should like to salute all the leaders of Relief Society throughout the whole Church, all the leaders, past and present, who for one hundred years have guided successfully the destinies of this great and mighty organization. May the Lord continue to bless us all is my earnest prayer. Relief Society Membership President Louise Y. Robison IN a Relief Society meeting last season, the class leader had followed the outline for our work in the literature of the New Testament so inspirationally that, for the hour, we lived with the Savior and his disciples. It had taken us to a higher plane, and we had the desire in our hearts to live nearer to our Father in heaven. At the close of this meeting, one of the members came to the class leader and said, \"I would love to have time to study the gospel as you have done, but it seems that home duties call me away from study.\" The understanding class leader said, \"Yes, I know; I have taken care of my house all of my life, but I have never been told, nor do I believe, that my Heavenly Father gave me this precious earth life solely to do these things. Couldn't you try to adjust your time so that some of it could be used for the eternal principles? I have been taught through the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith that we are saved no faster than we gain knowledge, and that a person cannot successfully serve our Heavenly Father without the knowledge of his laws.\"\nOf course, the element of time is a consideration, but each woman has twenty-four hours of time given her each day to use as she desires, in her own way. Now, most of us, in buying our bread and butter for our families, go to the place where we have confidence in the goods, though the food may last only until tomorrow. But when we go to a place where we find good thoughts, where we learn ideals that we can take home to our children, it is of great importance! The home is the laboratory of the souls of those entrusted to our care, and a good idea, a good book, a good thought, or a prayer is of great importance, as we were told today by Brother Driggs, in this home that produces high ideals.\nBut there are so many interests, and we naturally look around and think, which is the most important to give for our time. And the question arises, How about Relief Society? What does it offer its members?\nFirst, Relief Society offers elevating, beautiful friendships. The best friendships of my life have been formed through the Society, and\nOur meetings are called together, and the first thing is to remember Him in song?which brings a sweet worshipful peace. Then the prayer is offered, a humble prayer offered by one of our humble sisters, but asking for that precious gift, the gift that God will send us?his spirit, which is light and truth.\nThis is followed then, and is the setting for the theology lesson which teaches us the will of our Father in heaven and his laws that will prepare us for his kingdom. Then, in testimony meeting, we have the opportunity of telling each other of the kindness of our Heavenly Father to us and of the beautiful principles of the gospel, and just as sure as we come in contact with his spirit, we take it to our homes. It is this spirit that builds up the faith of our children.\nThe second Tuesday of our Relief Society is more of a social day. We meet more informally, we learn to take care of our homes and our children, and we give service to others in our Welfare Plan, that we with better part may ask for God's blessing at the close of day.\nThen, the study of the literature of the New Testament, that wonderful part of the Bible that inspires us with higher thoughts; and the innumerable poems and stories and songs, inspired by these truths, raise the standard of culture in our homes.\nThe fourth study is a practical study of character development, of honesty and morality and truth. Where these are taught in the home, supplemented by the faith that has been developed, children are fortified to meet life when they cross the bridge from the home to the work of the world. Nor are we left alone. Our Father in Heaven is as much interested ln our children?more so, even, than we, and he has said to us: *'Be thou humble; and the Lord Thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers\" (Doc. And Gov. 112:10). Is there any promise greater for us to receive in return for the time spent properly? Active membership in Relief Society makes this promise secure through the beautiful lessons provided for us through the inspired teacher or class leader, and through a prayerful study of the principles of the gospel of Jesus Ghrist. Membership in Relief Society is offered to all women who seek to live the better life. I leave my prayer and my blessing for these fine women, the Presidency of this organization and the General Board, who, through the priesthood of the living God, have been given the torch to light, to lead us into perfection, to make our homes clean and pure, that there will be no evil come in. I pray that the stake presidents may receive this light and carry it to the wards, and, most important, that the ward presidents may receive this light, and that they may have the blessing in giving and interpreting it to the individual members, that we will all, when we leave here, turn to our Father in heaven, that these precious souls that he has entrusted to our care, our children, may be pure and clean and sweet. May this be our lot, I humbly ask in the name of Jesus Ghrist. Amen. Feed My Lambs\" Presiding Bishop LeGrand Richards IT should not be hard to say something to a group like this. I love the Relief Society and I have reason to because I have served as bishop of three different wards, and I have said that I could get along as well without a first counselor as I could without the Relief Society president. We have been particularly privileged, the present Presiding Bishopric of the Church, to be able to labor as advisers to Sister Robison and her counselors, to Sister Lyman and her counselors, and now to Sister Spafford and her assistants. Recently our work has been divided so that we are only advisers in their temporal affairs and their work in caring for the poor and those in distress. We have learned to love and appreciate these women, and it is a delight to be here this morning, to listen to them, as I know it is to each one of you here present today. This is a wonderful Church! Yesterday we went to the temple, the General Authorities with the mission presidents, in a meeting that commenced at nine o'clock, and we left there at twenty minutes after five. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 743 As I sat listening to the mission presidents bring back to the headquarters of the Church the spirit of the work that is being done under their direction, from the fringe of the Church, where the Church is expanding, I said to myself, \"Well, if the Prophet Joseph had died for the establishment of the missionary system of this Church only, he surely would not have died in vain.\" Then to come here this morning and see this grand group of Relief Society workers, and let our minds go out to what is actually being done in the Church everywhere, I say again that if the Prophet Joseph had died for the establishment of the Relief Society organization of this Church only, he surely would not have died in vain. I want to remind you of one statement of the Master. You will remember how he gathered his followers from their nets and their fishes. After Jesus was crucified, Peter said, \"I go fishing,\" and you remember that others of the disciples followed him, and then how Jesus came and found them when they were not successful in their fishing and he told them to cast their nets on the other side, and you know then the success that followed. And then Jesus said, directing himself to Peter: Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? (These fishes.) He saith unto him. Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him. Feed my lambs. He saith unto him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him. Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him. Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him. Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep (John 21:15-17). TAGW, sisters, I do not know anything in the world that we can do to more pleasingly demonstrate to our Father in heaven our love of him than feeding the sheep and the lambs of his fold. He has said that the good shepherd leaves the ninety and nine to go out after the one strayed away. We, from the Presidency down, are going to try in this Church to emphasize ward teaching as it has never been done before. We feel that we are becoming marvelously organized and equipped and qualified for doing our work within the sacred walls of our beautiful buildings, but there are many, many on every hand who do not gather to receive the word of God, that we must accentuate our effort and emphasize it, to go to the homes and there carry the message and the spirit of this great latter-day work about which you have been speaking this morning. The Relief Society has a program that parallels the great ward teaching program of the Church. You are messengers to the homes. I like that part of the Relief Society work, where it is done in the right spirit and by faithful and efficient women ?and we have thousands and tens of thousands of them in the Church today?who go into the homes of the Latter-day Saints, taking with them the spirit of the gospel, the spirit of Christ, looking after the lost ones and gathering in and helping and encouraging where encouragement is necessary. If the sisters of this great organization will unite in the spirit of the priesthood of the Church to try to awaken within the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, particularly in those who have been inactive and indifferent, a love of the truth, a devotion to God and his great latter-day work, I am sure we will see the work of God going on as it has never done before, and the day will come when we will learn how to do our work for the salvation and exaltation of our Father's children in a far better manner than we have ever done before. God bless each one of you in your various fields, in your wards and stakes, and give you vision and power and inspiration, that you may touch the hearts of your people, that you may arise in your great assignment to heights you have never dreamed of before, to the honor and glory of God and the blessing and the salvation of his children, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. ?Photograph courtesy Salt Lake Tribune. THREE GENERAL PRESIDENTS OF RELIEF SOCIETY President Amy Brown Lyman, 1940-1945; President Belle S. Spafford, 1945?-; President Louise Y. Robison, 1928-1939. (This picture was taken at the reception honoring President Amy Brown Lyman, October 3, 1945.) GENERAL SESSION, AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 4, 1945 Wartime Activities of Our European Relief Society Counselor Gertrude R. Garff HOW wonderful it is to meet in Relief Society general conference again! How privileged we are to be able to assemble and listen to the counsel of the President of our Church. I think we have never appreciated this privilege as we do now because we were not granted the opportunity of gathering in conferences during the war years. We rejoice that this opportunity has been restored to us. Today in this great gathering are Relief Society women from most of the stakes of Zion, and most of the missions of the Church are represented by the presence of Relief Society mission presidents or Relief Society mission presidents who have only recently been released. However, there is a great group of loyal, faithful Relief Society women who have no representation here today, with but one exception, and who, I know, are with us in spirit if not in the flesh. They are our European Relief Society sisters. My sisters, we in the United States have been in constant communication with the Church authorities. Many of us could listen to the conference proceedings over the radio. Also, we were visited quarterly at stake conferences by Church authorities, and at any time we could write in to headquarters and get any counsel and help that was needed. Many of our missions have been handicapped by the lack of missionaries, but they did have mission presidents and Relief Society presidents sent from headquarters to preside over and lead the work there, and were in communication with the Church most of the time. In spite of these handicaps, they accomplished a wonderful work in both war and regular Relief Society activities. Some even started welfare plans and had singular success with these ventures. Today, I wish to pay tribute to our sisters in Europe. These women who have carried on Relief Society work under handicaps that would be discouraging even with missionaries in their midst. Since the fall of 1939, when the European saints sang \"God Be With You Till We Meet Again,\" while waving goodbye to the missionaries on board ships sailing to America, our European brothers and sisters (with the exception of the British who have had good communication with Church headquarters) have had very little direct communication with Church authorities and the leadership was placed in the hands of local brethren. They have suffered tribulation beyond our comprehension. The Church and auxiliaries through Brother Thomas E. McKay, Assistant to the Council of the Twelve, have made every effort to get lessons and communications to these good people. Barring accident to letters and lessons enroute ?Norway and Denmark were reached through Sweden; Germany, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands were reached through Switzerland; and conversely, any word we received reached us by the same route. Occasionally, we would get and send Red Cross messages; but they took six to eight months to get to their destination, and were only a few words long. However, we were thankful for the information received, though scarce, and, now, since the cessation of hostilities, many letters bearing foreign postmarks have arrived and the stories they tell are of great interest to us. So that these sisters may have a part in our conference today, I am going to tell you of some of their activities. Can you imagine our wards with none of the brethren present to conduct the meetings?to administer the sacrament? Quite generally throughout the European mission, and especially in Norway, Germany, and Switzerland, the men belonging to the Church were in service or had gone underground. The Relief Society women were called to hold the people together, to conduct all the meetings. They even had singing practice and in some places the Singing Mothers' groups were very active. The Relief Society visiting teachers were given added responsibility as there were no men to do ward teaching. Where it was possible and there were older men holding the priesthood, they would visit the branches periodically and ad-minster the sacrament. At all other times it was the Relief Society women who carried the full responsibility of keeping the Church membership together. With the beginning of the war the Relief Society plunged into war work along with their regular programs. In Britain, under the direction of Sister Anastasiou who is here with us today, the Relief Society, among other things, gathered clothing for refugee organizations and received a gracious letter of thanks from the council in charge of distributing this clothing. ONE of the most touching incidents to come to us from Europe is the story of Sister Zippro, the Netherlands Relief Society president. She was willing to face alone the dangers of an invading army in order that members of the Church might receive assistance from the Relief Society. After hostilities between the two armies ceased, this dear sister, knowing of the terrible destruction of Rotterdam, concluded to ride her bicycle (the only means of travel because train travel, etc., was thoroughly disrupted) sixty miles from Amsterdam to Rotterdam. She found many of the families living with other members, as they had lost all earthly belongings when their homes had been completely destroyed by bombs. She immediately ascertained their needs and started to raise funds from among the other members to help those most affected by the invasion. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE Her bravery and devotion to the ideals of Relief Society under such trying and perilous circumstances are worthy of our highest praise. Nor did our Relief Society sisters confine their benevolent work to their own missions, but gave generously of their resources to those of another country. The Oslo Branch Relief Society gave a dinner for the; old people of the branch and the food was furnished by the Danish Relief Society, otherwise no festival could have been held as food was almost as scarce in Norway as anywhere in Europe. Both the Swedish and Danish missions obtained food permits at regular intervals and sent food into Norway to be distributed among the Norwegian saints. It is amazing to note that in such a terrible period of our world's history, new Relief Societies were being organized. I want to read an excerpt from a letter to Brother McKay from Elder Fritz Johanssen, the Swedish Mission President: Between August 7 and 22, together with District President Claus A. Person and Sister Astrid Johanssen of the mission Relief Society board, I made a journey to Finland. The little Society was organized at my first visit shortly after the winter war 1939-40 to a regular branch. This time we had the great pleasure of baptizing three persons. This time I was inspired to undertake the Finland journey and at the same time write an additional part of its gospel history as far as Finland is concerned, namely, that the first female Relief Society was organized there. Time and again we felt as when the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith 747 organized the first Relief Society in the world. All of the letters I have read coming from Europe tell of the terrific need for clothing. Clothing is, of course, rationed, but even those with money cannot find the necessary items to buy. Our members in Denmark have gone stockingless for a year at a time and shoes are never seen in the shops. As is generally the case, the children are suffering the most. Now permission has been granted to send eleven-pound packages into all the missions except Germany and Czechoslovakia; and I am happy to report that packages are being sent by our Central Welfare Storehouse to the branch and Relief Society presidents for distribution to the needy members, which include nearly all since money is not involved. There just aren't any clothes to buy of either good or bad quality. My dear sisters, what inspired these women to perform these unselfish and thoughtful deeds? It was their membership in Relief Society, their knowledge of the purpose and ideals of Relief Society, that gave them the courage to undertake those difficult tasks. It was the Relief Society organization that empowered those women and made their efforts to gather funds and clothing and to send food to members in another country effective. Without this organization, they could not have been prepared to take over the responsibility of handling the work of the branches when they were left with no priesthood to officiate. Their letters thank us for our prayers in their behalf.Let us give thanks for these faithful sisters and brothers for their trials have indeed been greater than ours. In closing, I wish to bear my testimony. I am thankful for the gospel, for the meaning it gives to my life. I am thankful for the opportunity of serving the Lord and I feel to express with Moroni of old: And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled (Moroni 10:31), Dream for a Relief Society Building Counselor Marianne C. Sharp T WOULD ask an interest in your faith and prayers for I feel that words are very inadequate to express the feelings which are in my heart today. I am grateful for the privilege we have as sisters?as mothers always working for the salvation of our children and as Church members striving for the furtherance of the work of the Church?to meet together once more in a Relief Society general conference. I am grateful, personally, for the opportunity I have to work in the Relief Society under Sister Spafford who is true and faithful, and I want to thank my Heavenly Father for this privilege. I love the Relief Society. I love the sisters in the Relief Society and have joy in association with them. Wherever I have lived or visited in the Church I have felt the close bond of love and service which links together the members of the Society today. The members today, however, are only links in a great chain of sisters which reaches back to include the valiant and great women of the past 103 years, and will stretch forward to encompass those yet unborn who will devote their services to working for the good of others, always seeking at the same time to improve themselves. I am thinking particularly this afternoon of those sisters who have gone on before. Ever since Sister Lyman appointed Sister Spafford and me to help prepare the book A Centenary oi Relief Society to commemorate the hundredth birthday of the Society, I have felt very near to the Relief Society leaders of the past and the faithful members who are the mothers, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers, even great-great-grandmothers, of the members today. They have stepped out alive for me from the pages of the Woman's Exponent and from the minutes of the General Board. Their testimonies have increased my testimony. I have shared in their joys and sorrows and, as nearly as one can, I have entered into their desires for the upbuilding of Relief Society. As we studied this history of the past, we read of one great dream which had gone unfulfilled. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 749 It is of this unfulfilled dream I wish to speak today. In order to introduce it, I will take you back forty-nine years ago yesterday to October 3, 1896, to a general Relief Society conference held in the Assembly Hall. Aunt Zina Young was the president of the Relief Society at that time and with her on the stand sat her three counselors, her vice-presidents as they were called, First Counselor Jane S. Richards, Second Counselor Bathsheba W. Smith, and\" her third Counselor Sarah M. Kimball. It was near the end of the afternoon session that, according to the minutes taken by Sister Emmeline B. Wells, then secretary: President Zina D. H. Young, in her remarks, opened out upon the subject of a house for the Relief Society, to be owned by them. Women had done so much to help build other public buildings and temples that they had no means to build one for the Relief Society. President C. O. Card had said when they lacked the means to go on with the Logan Temple and the men were to be discharged because there was no means to pay them for their work, Sister Jane S. Richards raised five hundred dollars in the Relief Society of Weber County to keep the men working, and that stands as a memento to the sisters forever. Vice President Sarah M. Kimball confined her remarks to the subject of a house for the Society. She felt it a humiliation to be without a place of our own; we had contributed to all public places and at all times. Now we want to have a house and we want land to build it on and it should be in the shadow of the temple. It should be a place to receive strangers in when they come, a place where letters can be written\" from and information given, I think we should vote on this matter, whether you representative women want this building or not; we want to put it to vote. Sister Kimball told the sisters what Joseph Smith had said in Nauvoo to the sisters of the Society there and had given them a lot belonging to the Church and a house on it which could be repaired and made useful. Now, said Sister Kimball, I want to ask you sisters if you want such a building as I have described. The motion was put and the vote was unanimous. Sister Kimball added, if you want this proposition carried out, then see how much can be done. The interest in building a house for the Relief Society continued strong and money began to be collected, however through the next ten years there also ran the fear, expressed quite often by those dear, faithful sisters as once stated by Sister M. Isabella Home?\"don't branch out too largely at once, there is not much to do with, and the Relief Society must care for the poor.? In view of this great financial responsibility which they felt was theirs, the money was not quickly forthcoming, but the dreaming and planning went on. Their plans called for kitchens, pantries, banqueting hall, cooking utensils, a furnace and closets and a room for the janitor, and offices upstairs, \"with library and bureau of information, that will be in the best sense educational, and be open to all members of the society, and where lectures may be given by distinguished professors in all branches of science, art and literature, and on general topics.\" In 1900, the Young Ladies Mutual Improvement Association and the Primary Association joined forces with the Relief Society with the hope that together the three could raise enough money for a suitable woman's building. March 1901, The matter was presented to President Lorenzo Snow who, in was reported to have said: The women must have twenty thousand dollars before commencing the house; in fact, before we could put a spade in the ground or have the land measured off, and when we had that amount on hand he would give the deed of the land, and we could be as sure of it as you will of happiness when you get to heaven. In speaking to the Relief Society at an outing at Saltair, July 9, 1901, President Snow said in part: You who are present today are members of the oldest organization in the Church outside of the Priesthood. The Relief Society was organized nearly sixty years ago, with 18 members (my sister, Eliza R. Snow being the secretary) by the Prophet Joseph Smith, under the inspiration of the Lord; and from that day to the present it has gone on without interruption growing in strength and usefulness, until today it is recognized as one of the most powerful forces for good in the Church. You are now 30,000 strong I am told, with a building fund of nearly $5,000, and with upwards of $100,000 worth of property in your possession. In addition to this you are the only ones among the Saints who are doing anything in a financial way against a day of famine. Your work in this direction is most commendable, and I hear as a result that you have 103,783 bushels of grain, together with an amount of flour and beans, safely stored against a time of need, as well as $3,331 to expend for the same purpose. In a letter of July 1901 signed by the First Presidency, Lorenzo Snow and Joseph F. Smith, it stated: We commend the undertaking [of a woman's building] and have contributed a valuable building site opposite the Temple, valued at $18,000. Sister Zina D. H. Young, President of the Relief Society, died in August 1901, and, in October 1901, President Lorenzo Snow passed away. The new president of the Church, President Joseph F. Smith, called Bathsheba W. Smith to be the new Relief Society president, and the plans continued to progress under her administration. The site which has been described on which a three-story building of yellow pressed brick with a stone foundation was to be built for a woman's building became the Bishop's Building?Relief Society donated $8500 toward its erection and was given quarters in it. The first Relief Society General Board meeting was held in it December 3,1909. This, in brief, is the story of the dream for a Relief Society building which was never built. It is a story of heartache for the Relief Society women who had planned and worked for it for so many years. Relief Society today, however, has already outgrown the space that would have been given it in the proposed woman's building. What seemed a tragedy may prove a blessing and joy to Relief Society in the future. I am thankful for the Relief Society women of the past. I am thankful for their vision. They were great and noble women, women who had faith in their own cause, who loved Relief Society, but who knew that the welfare of the whole Church was above all their welfare. They humbly accepted the decisions of the Church authorities with faith as being in their best interests. They were obedient. May we in our day be as devoted and as faithful? and in all things may we render as full and as unstinted an obedience to the authorities of the Church as did our sisters of long ago is my prayer. A Relief Society Building to Be Erected President Belle S. Spafford THIS is a glorious day for Relief Society, a day for which we have longed and prayed, knowing full well it could come only when the nations should still the guns of war. We are grateful to our Heavenly Father that the hostilities which have engulfed the earth, spreading destruction and breaking hearts, have ceased. We acknowledge his goodness that so soon after the disruptions of war we are privileged to meet in a general Relief Society conference.\nThis is the first general Relief Society conference to be held since the Society observed its 102th birthday. We are today setting our feet forward on the second century of Relief Society history. As we approach this new era, we do not anticipate any new nor great departmental purposes of the Society as set forth by the Prophet Joseph Smith and reiterated by each of the succeeding presidents of the Church.\nThe past is a force that is alive, and, like all living things, is growing and maturing while preserving a pattern that can be recognized and defined. From the past we inherit not only patterns and standards, but vision, strength, insight, faith and courage. The past has passed on to us, too, as a part of our heritage, its unfulfilled dreams and desires and bids us keep faith with it in regard to these, for these, too, are a constant invitation to advancement and progress.\nSister Sharp has brought to your attention today a deep-seated and sincere desire that has persisted in the hearts and minds of Relief Society women year after year as the century has rolled by?the desire for a Relief Society building, one that would beautifully and adequately represent the women of the Church. This desire, born and nurtured in the past, is today firmly rooted in our hearts. And, entering as we are upon a second century of Relief Society, a strong and growing organization rich in the blessings of the Lord, this seems the right and appropriate time to bring to fruition this dream of the past, to erect a building that shall stand a monument to Latter-day Saint women and a credit to the Church.\nOur Church is the foremost organization in all the world with regard to women. The restored gospel gives to women a position of dignity and respect. It recognizes their spiritual and mental powers and their right to use their inborn talents to the full. Latter-day Saint women have been organized under the priesthood after a pattern of the priesthood and have been provided unlimited opportunities for development. The gospel teaches that women have an appointed place in the plan of salvation and that the Lord loves his daughters as he loves his sons and that the promises, blessings are the same for both. It, therefore, seems entirely fitting that a building should be erected as a symbol to all people of the lofty position accorded faithful daughters of our Heavenly Father in the gospel plan.\nNurtured by a Church recognizing woman's true position, women have, in turn, given full devotion to the Church. This has been true with regard to the building program of the Church. Even before the women were organized as a Society in Nauvoo, they banded together to help feed and clothe the men working on the Kirtland Temple. It was with the desire to aid the work of building the Nauvoo Temple that Sarah M. Kimball, in 1842, invited her neighbors to join with her in forming a \"Ladies' Society.\" When the Prophet Joseph Smith was approached regarding this matter, he invited the women to meet with him and some of the brethren a week later, at which time (March 17, 1842) the women were organized as the \"Female Relief Society of Nauvoo.\"\nLucy Mack, mother of the Prophet, spoke of the importance attached by the women to their activities in behalf of the Nauvoo Temple, as follows:\nThere was but one mainspring to all our thoughts and actions and that was the building of the Lord's house.\nRelief Society women have given of their best according to their circumstances and conditions, toward the building, furnishing, and beautifying of temples erected by the Church.\nNot only have Relief Society women been vitally interested in the building of temples but they have been generous in their donations to stake tabernacles, ward meeting houses, and other Church buildings, generally raising funds for these edifices as well as building funds,\ncooking and serving dinners or conducting bazaars which have taken weeks and months of tedious preparation.\nYet, after more than one hundred years, during which time they have actively participated in the building program of the Church, they stand today with no home of their own.\nThe continuing growth of the Society, with the continuous expansion of the various departments connected by the General Board, also demand that provision soon be made to more adequately house the general offices, the temple-burial clothes, Magazine, welfare and other departments.\nWith the consent of the First Presidency, and with your support, it is our intention to go forward immediately with plans for the building and for financing its erection. It is our desire to have the building belong to the women of the Church and to have every Relief Society woman feel the pride of ownership in it. It is our desire to have the building not only house the general offices and the various departments maintained by the General Board, but to have it be of service to all members of the Society. We expect to include in it comfortable lounge rooms where you may leave your wraps, a well as meet a friend; check rooms where you may leave your bundles; a relic room where choice articles of historic value may be preserved and displayed; an auditorium with well-equipped work and exhibition kitchens where homemaking demonstrations and lectures may be given, as well as other features suitable to a Relief Society building and the work of the Society."

            "content": "The Gospel in the Relief Society Educational Program\nElder Howard R. Driggs\nI HAVE never faced in all my life so many good and beautiful women. It is an honor and privilege to stand before you, and I humbly pray to God to help me to say those things that will lift us all to higher levels as I am lifted this morning by this occasion. The keynote of what I should like to say is to be found in a song we all love to sing, \"Thanks for our teachers who labor with care, that we in the light of the gospel may shine.\" No other word occurs more frequently or is echoed more beautifully throughout all our scriptures than the word \"light.\" The Savior said, \"I am the light and the life,\" and he advised us to let our\nlight so shine that a man seeing our good deeds would glorify God, who is in heaven.\nIf the teacher has one purpose above another, it is to radiate light. It is to illumine truth; it is to lead souls out of the darkness into the light. I think no more beautiful story has ever come to me as to the real work of the teacher than that found in the life story of Helen Keller. As a little girl, Helen Keller enjoyed one brief period of sunshine, of flowers, of bird song, of home joys. Then, suddenly, through dread illness, she was plunged, by being bereft of sight and hearing, into what she called \"a prison house of darkness.\" GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 733 As she came back to consciousness out of that disease, she said she was beating the bars of that physical prison, trying to get back into the light. Yet in that darkness, she might have remained, \"had not she come, my teacher, who was to set my spirit free/' Anna Suhi-van, a devoted, understanding, loving teacher, took that little human soul and led her back into the sunshine. She placed in her hands, literally, the key of language to open the prison house. She brought her forth into glorious womanhood, where she could make her contribution magnificently to the world. Every one of US is a teacher, either by example or precept, or both. Every human being is teaching other human beings. It is true that officers and teachers of great organizations such as this are called especially to the privilege. That doesn't take away the duty and the opportunity of everyone of us to lead souls into the light. This is especially true of gospel teachers. Our constant effort should be to make the world brighter, not only today but for all time. We should ever remember this, that so far as the teaching, of the gospel is concerned, the spirit of the gospel is \"caught,\" rather than \"taught.\" One cannot impart the spirit of the gospel by mere words or by a recital of facts. What is in you radiates from you. The Apostle Paul called our attention to this very picturesquely when he said, \"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\" We carry the spirit of the gospel with us, or we do not. If we carry it with us, those around us catch the light of our illumination. It matters not whether we represent an arc light or one of less candle power, our business is to light up the dark corners where we happen to be. Dear old Dr. Maeser, with whom I was privileged to associate in the long ago years, said this once to a class of teachers in training: \"You can't teach even arithmetic most successfully unless you radiate something of the spirit of the gospel.\" It is a challenging assertion, but it is true. Oh, of course there are teachers who seem to radiate little or none of the spirit of the gospel, but they would do better with that spirit, and they are always excelled by those teachers who combine intellect and spirituality. NOW, to your educational program. The Relief Society, in its marvelous way, has spread before its members and its officers and all the world, a well-rounded program touching the various phases of basic life. Every lesson that you teach goes to its highest level only when it is taught with a testimony of the gospel in your hearts. Even in your work meetings, where, with nimble fingers, sisters gather around a quilt and begin to sew, and generally to talk, if the spirit of the gospel is not in that spontaneous expression and in the hearts of those who are doing the work, there is something of vital worth lacking. Many a lesson in gospel service is lastingly impressed by those who scatter sunshine and uplifting thoughts while they work. Apply the same truth to your lessons in Church history. In this study one should keep the mind on the final outcomes and not be led into things of little consequence.\nWhen I was a boy I was brought into this temple yard. On an excursion from Pleasant Grove and West Jordan, some of us school children were privileged to come here and see the temple which was being built. It wasn't up to the square. We were permitted to climb the winding stairs to the top and look over the city. One thing I remember was that this yard was littered with stones, with all sorts of tools. We don't see those things now; we see the glorious temple with its spires pointing heavenward.\nEvery man's life and every woman's life in the building is likely to have some litter about it, but by what do we judge the life? by the outcome. Think of this when you teach lessons in history. Let the gospel light guide this great work.\nIn the lessons on literature recently given we started out with that found in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. The central aim of all was to bring you back to the Bible, to make you love that book of books. These courses were not planned for one year. One cannot get out the Bible in eight or sixteen lessons. They were planned to lay a firm foundation for reading and rereading and enjoying the Bible. With that work as a basis and as a standard, we are now entering upon the study of the influence of the Bible and Christian teaching on our\nliterature. I think that we have here a measuring rod by which we can determine whether any literature that has been created is worthy of a place in our home libraries. A book that does not vibrate a spirit of the gospel is open to serious challenge as to whether it goes into the home or not. There is nothing narrow about this; it is soundly basic for all great literature that will be read and reread vibrates to the story of the Bible.\nParents have today the challenge, as never before, to get closer to the literature of their children. Nothing offers a better chance to get nearer to their hearts and souls than good books. We need to cultivate such a companionship in our homes.\nMay I pay tribute here to my dear mother, in closing. She made our library the center of our home, and she was ever ready to read some beautiful poem, to tell us some story. She saw to it that even though the linen closet or the china closet might not be as richly furnished as in other homes, she had good books in that room where we loved to gather.\nWe must pay more attention to the spiritual uplift of our homes. We must unite in getting better books in our homes. We must radiate the light of the gospel there.\nGod bless you in the great work you are doing, multiply and spread it, that the gospel may shine in every home in its simplicity, its purity, with its saving grace, I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. Relief Society?s Expanding Welfare Service Elder Henry D. Moyle Chairman, General Welfare Committee THIS opportunity to advance the welfare program of the Church, though unsolicited, I can assure you is nevertheless deeply appreciated. Nor do I accept this invitation without a keen realization of the responsibility resting upon me. I appreciate this kind of consideration extended me by your able Presidency. I am sure, to the extent that any of us measures up to that which is expected of him, it is due entirely to the assistance he receives from his Heavenly Father. Without the assurance that he will and does help us, many of us, of whom I know I am myself one, would find our tasks insurmountable.\nIt is with this spirit of dependence upon the Lord that we must all approach our expanding responsibility?the welfare service of the Church. We must further acknowledge our individual insufficiency in carrying on the work by exhibiting a dependence upon each other. There is none of us in this Church so good or great or endowed with power sufficient to magnify his office and calling in the Church without receiving much assistance and in many ways?from his brethren and sisters in the wards and stakes of the Church in which he lives and works.\nWelfare work is no exception to this well-established rule, which we might call \"the rule of dependency\" of the Church. That which I say is, of course, auxiliary to the priest-\nhood, not to any quorum in particular, but to all quorums equally. Our spiritual and temporal welfare is so closely interwoven, there can be no clear line of demarcation between the two. No one can say the Relief Society takes care of either spiritual or temporal or secular? and not both. Every visit made by a Relief Society teacher, every class held, inspires someone to live nearer the Maker, and, at the same time, prepares that same person to take better care of herself and of her family temporally.\nSo we arrive at the first conclusion in projecting our welfare program into the future, and that is a complete organization is an absolute necessity. By this I mean we must first have a Relief Society fully officered and organized and functioning. Second, a welfare committee in each stake and ward on which the Relief Society presidency of the stake and ward are personally and actively represented. When this is the case, the stake Relief Society comes in direct contact each month with the president of the stake and the presidents of the various priesthood quorums, as well as the stake work directors, and the ward Relief Society meets each week with the bishop and the representatives of the priesthood quorums in the ward and the ward work directors, and, at this meeting, should become intimately familiar with the details of the welfare work of the ward and the needs of the membership, and it is at this meeting that they are assigned their duties and responsibilities for the coming month.\nOUR basic problem in taking care of our own, as most of you know, is to render each family in the Church able to care for its own. We have perfected, to a marvelous degree, the production of the welfare budget. It is a pleasure for me to report to you all in time that the record of the Relief Society as an organization in assisting to produce this budget has not only been active in producing the budget, but has helped more than any other single agency in the Church to see to it that the budget, to the extent that it has been distributed, has reached those who needed it. I know of no failure, in the Church, of the Relief Society to promptly and adequately do that which they have been commissioned to do by their bishops since the inception of our welfare program. I am sure your future is to do more. We must increase materially our distribution.\nYou sisters appreciate that in planning for the welfare of the Church, we must produce more than we distribute in order to provide a surplus from which we can momentarily draw in case of a sudden or unexpected turn of events. It is, however, important while securing this insurance that we do not overlook these needs may not be apparent. By so doing we perform more fully our present responsibility and we are, at the same time, able to determine more accurately the extent to which, in the Church, we can better develop means and\nmethods of distribution, and in every other way fit and prepare and qualify ourselves to more adequately carry on our work in the future, and, above all, to more fully meet promptly any emergency. This, after all, is the best form of insurance of which we can conceive.\nTHE welfare work, as originally announced by the First Presidency, divides itself into four major subdivisions. We have thus far discussed the first general subdivision, that of temporary relief, involving, as has been suggested, the production and distribution of the budget. The second general subdivision deals with the permanent security of the members of the Church. A simple illustration suffices to bring out clearly the distinction between these two major phases of our work. A member in need can be given an order on the bishops' storehouse. This is temporary relief just as our budgets are temporary. They must be renewed every year to meet the temporary needs of that current year. It may be possible, however, to find this same needy member employment, and then we have solved his problem and removed the necessity for any temporary relief, and this latter we call permanent security.\nUnquestionably, with the termination of hostilities in the world, the finding of employment and thus readjusting the lives of these, our brothers and sisters, whose lives were thrown out of adjustment by the war, is a real major problem. Before this problem has been successfully met, the Relief Society will no doubt have played a most important role in its ultimate solution. I commend this problem to you as one which justifies and calls for the best there is in the Relief Society.\nTo meet this problem, as well as all other problems that arise in the welfare program, the Church looks to the family for the final solution. If families cannot succeed in making each of their individual members self-sustaining through the united effort of all, there is little hope that any outside agency could add much toward any permanent solution of that individual's problem. As a matter of fact, it is natural for the family to always have some members dependent upon it. That's what families are for. The father and mother are dependent upon each other. It is to be hoped we shall always have children in our homes, and so long as we have children we shall have a family rather than an individual problem.\nI WANT to go one step further and say that I hope we always have parents and grandparents in our homes, and, so long as we do, their problems as well as the problems of the children, are and should be the problems of the family. Up to date, at least, in Latter-day Saint homes, we have undertaken to provide in our homes for all members of our family, be they old or young. There has never been any difference in the nation made for spiritual guidance. We depend upon the priesthood of the father as the head of the family, assisted by his sons who may hold the priesthood. We unite the family daily in family prayer, we pray unitedly for the support, maintenance, welfare, spirituality and temporal progress we undertake to take in the family circle to direct\nthe footsteps of our children and to make the family influence predominate in the child's life, and expect the early training to be followed throughout life. The children in the Church, as they grow to maturity, reflect in their lives the teachings of their mother and father in the family. You mothers in Israel must continue to do your part. As a people, we must never be willing to give to another the rearing of our children.\nSome say it is proper for the government to raise our families, send them to school, etc., because some of us pay taxes, or for some other equally absurd reason. We do not pay taxes for the purpose of having other people raise our children or care for our elderly people. If this were the reason for taxes, we might all very well keep our money and do the job ourselves without paying a large proportion of the sums used for that purpose for professional services.\nAs Latter-day Saints, we believe without any question that to destroy family responsibility is to destroy the family, and with the family destroyed, the Church would be gone. No church on earth claims for the family what we claim. The restoration of the gospel in this dispensation included the appearance of Elijah before the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple on the third day of April, 1836, in fulfillment of the prophecy of Malachi, \"to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse.\"\nWe can hardly say that our hearts often go to the cradles of our children or that our children's hearts have been turned toward us, if we are in the frame of mind which permits us to share in any way, shape, or form the responsibility of parenthood with the world or any of its agencies, and if this be true it follows as a necessary corollary that our children cannot prepare themselves for full fellowship in the Church or magnify their offices and callings in the priesthood if they shirk their responsibility toward their parents, or share it in ever so small a way with the world.\nMay I ask: Can we love our mothers and leave the determination of their needs to laws or strangers, and the provision of these needs to the unearthliness and insecurities of the world? A few years ago, no one of us would have thought in this Church of favoring a law which relieved the mothers of support of the children. However, there are bills in Congress today, in the Congress of the United States, that look toward giving the mothers assistance for their children, without any relationship to need. In other words, any mother, if these laws were passed, as they have been passed in other countries, would be assisted by the government. The government does not recognize the father as the head of the family for obvious reasons. Dealing with the mother, the question of legitimacy or illegitimacy of the children involved need not be questioned. Need we say more?\nThe question might be put rather bluntly and boldly in these words: Do we as a people so far worship money that we are willing to the slightest degree to relinquish parental control of our children for gold?\nIn projecting the ever-expanding welfare program of the Church, we call upon the Relief Society as an organization and all of its members individually in faith and humility to answer these questions directly, and to be a direct influence in our own families for maintaining family unity, family integrity, family faith, and family loyalty to the ways of the Lord.\nThe Relief Society, like all other organizations in the Church, is confronted with the necessity of converting our saints to the simple fundamental principles of life and of truth everlasting, and to avoid the conflicting philosophies and theories of men in the world. To accomplish this purpose is to accomplish the purposes of the welfare program. We must gather Israel to the standards of our Lord.\nNeed we say that to be married for time and eternity in the house of the Lord by the priesthood is but the first step in the eternal scheme of family progression? The first step becomes as naught if we fail to continue to go forward in righteousness, maintaining the sacred relationship of family life and assuming all the responsibilities incident thereto throughout life, as we hope to do throughout eternity.\nThe Relief Society can and will, I am sure, expand its service so far as necessary to keep our brethren and sisters in the fold and to give to the priesthood of the Church the kind of an example and the encouragement through love and affection which will induce them to fully magnify their position in the family and in the Church; and that this may be our happy lot, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Relief Society Leadership President Amy Brown Lyman THE type of leadership which the Relief Society wishes to develop is the type which Jesus exemplified when he said, \"I am among you as one that serveth\" (Luke 22:27). In this same verse he says that it is greater to serve than to be served.\nThe service to which he dedicated his life was a service of unselfishness, self-sacrifice, and helpfulness. It was divinely inspired, was born of brotherly love, and safeguarded by the conception he held of the sacredness of the human personality. It was intelligent service resulting from keen observation and long years of study and preparation, and most important of all, from divine guidance.\nIt is assumed that as a boy Jesus lived a normal, peaceful, protected life in a humble house where he was trained to labor and work and to live in the fear of the Lord. It is evident that in he grew up he became an industrious worker, a careful observer, and a profound student, that he gained much knowledge by his own effort, and through prayer and devotion to our Heavenly Father he was blessed with great wisdom. Even at the age of twelve in his interview in the temple, he astonished the learned doctors with his unusual knowledge and attainments.\nWhat a glorious example and pattern of work, observation, and inspiration for leaders and teachers was his! He was perhaps the greatest of all\nleaders and teachers, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\nThe success of any enterprise depends largely upon its leaders. It is to them that people look for guidance, encouragement and inspiration.\nRelief Society, with its many fields of activity, requires many workers and as the years go by and new avenues of service appear, new and additional workers, with new and additional preparation and experience, will be needed. Leaders are needed for executive work and for class teaching; for choral work and dramatics; for art-needlework and plain sewing; for homemaking and household management; for training for parenthood and family life; and for social welfare work. And with frequent changes in executive officers, practically all the members are called sooner or later to lead out in some activity and thus assume some responsibility.\nOne of the first requisites of Relief society leaders is to live the gospel. They should aim to be living examples of what they advocate and teach, being \"doers of the word, and not hearers only\" (James 1:22). They should conform to all the standards and requirements set for Latter-day Saints and be true to the ideals of the Church and of the gospel. They should honor and respect the priesthood and should hearken to any instructions the priesthood offers. They should practice what they preach and preach what they practice. They should cultivate spirituality and thus increase and strengthen their own testimonies and the testimonies of those whom they lead. Relief Society leaders should also seek to enhance their general scholarship and learning which will increase their ability and bear fruit in their efforts to lead and influence others. They should have some familiarity with the standard works of the Church. They should know something about the history and the background of the Church and its leaders. They should be familiar with the history, background, activities, and accomplishments of the Relief Society, and of the women who have directed its work. It is sometimes mistakenly claimed that only those who are born leaders or are born with an aptitude for leadership and teaching can succeed as leaders and teachers. Experience in Relief Society over a period of many years has demonstrated that this is not a correct conclusion and that leadership can be developed. The Society has seen women grow and develop as they have accepted calls to serve, and have sought the spirit of the Lord to guide them. It has seen women changed, yes, almost transformed through Relief Society service. Many at first too timid to take any part, have, through study and prayerful effort and practice, become resourceful, successful officers and class teachers, able conversationalists, and strong, well-poised individuals. They have learned much about how to meet life successfully, how to adjust to their environment, and how to get along and live and work with others. They have learned to be patient, tolerant, sympathetic, and understanding, and their love for humanity, which is one of the most important elements in leadership, as it is in life itself (brotherly love, if you please), has increased with the years of their service. In closing, I should like to salute all the leaders of Relief Society throughout the whole Church, all the leaders, past and present, who for one hundred years have guided successfully the destinies of this great and mighty organization. May the Lord continue to bless us all is my earnest prayer. Relief Society Membership President Louise Y. Robison IN a Relief Society meeting last season, the class leader had followed the outline for our work in the literature of the New Testament so inspirationally that, for the hour, we lived with the Savior and his disciples. It had taken us to a higher plane, and we had the desire in our hearts to live nearer to our Father in heaven. At the close of this meeting, one of the members came to the class leader and said, \"I would love to have time to study the gospel as you have done, but it seems that home duties call me away from study.\" The understanding class leader said, \"Yes, I know; I have taken care of my house all of my life, but I have never been told, nor do I believe, that my Heavenly Father gave me this precious earth life solely to do these things. Couldn't you try to adjust your time so that some of it could be used for the eternal principles? I have been taught through the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith that we are saved no faster than we gain knowledge, and that a person cannot successfully serve our Heavenly Father without the knowledge of his laws.\"\nOf course, the element of time is a consideration, but each woman has twenty-four hours of time given her each day to use as she desires, in her own way. Now, most of us, in buying our bread and butter for our families, go to the place where we have confidence in the goods, though the food may last only until tomorrow. But when we go to a place where we find good thoughts, where we learn ideals that we can take home to our children, it is of great importance! The home is the laboratory of the souls of those entrusted to our care, and a good idea, a good book, a good thought, or a prayer is of great importance, as we were told today by Brother Driggs, in this home that produces high ideals.\nBut there are so many interests, and we naturally look around and think, which is the most important to give for our time. And the question arises, How about Relief Society? What does it offer its members?\nFirst, Relief Society offers elevating, beautiful friendships. The best friendships of my life have been formed through the Society, and\nOur meetings are called together, and the first thing is to remember Him in song?which brings a sweet worshipful peace. Then the prayer is offered, a humble prayer offered by one of our humble sisters, but asking for that precious gift, the gift that God will send us?his spirit, which is light and truth.\nThis is followed then, and is the setting for the theology lesson which teaches us the will of our Father in heaven and his laws that will prepare us for his kingdom. Then, in testimony meeting, we have the opportunity of telling each other of the kindness of our Heavenly Father to us and of the beautiful principles of the gospel, and just as sure as we come in contact with his spirit, we take it to our homes. It is this spirit that builds up the faith of our children.\nThe second Tuesday of our Relief Society is more of a social day. We meet more informally, we learn to take care of our homes and our children, and we give service to others in our Welfare Plan, that we with better part may ask for God's blessing at the close of day.\nThen, the study of the literature of the New Testament, that wonderful part of the Bible that inspires us with higher thoughts; and the innumerable poems and stories and songs, inspired by these truths, raise the standard of culture in our homes.\nThe fourth study is a practical study of character development, of honesty and morality and truth. Where these are taught in the home, supplemented by the faith that has been developed, children are fortified to meet life when they cross the bridge from the home to the work of the world. Nor are we left alone. Our Father in Heaven is as much interested ln our children?more so, even, than we, and he has said to us: *'Be thou humble; and the Lord Thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers\" (Doc. And Gov. 112:10). Is there any promise greater for us to receive in return for the time spent properly? Active membership in Relief Society makes this promise secure through the beautiful lessons provided for us through the inspired teacher or class leader, and through a prayerful study of the principles of the gospel of Jesus Ghrist. Membership in Relief Society is offered to all women who seek to live the better life. I leave my prayer and my blessing for these fine women, the Presidency of this organization and the General Board, who, through the priesthood of the living God, have been given the torch to light, to lead us into perfection, to make our homes clean and pure, that there will be no evil come in. I pray that the stake presidents may receive this light and carry it to the wards, and, most important, that the ward presidents may receive this light, and that they may have the blessing in giving and interpreting it to the individual members, that we will all, when we leave here, turn to our Father in heaven, that these precious souls that he has entrusted to our care, our children, may be pure and clean and sweet. May this be our lot, I humbly ask in the name of Jesus Ghrist. Amen."

That every person may be given opportunity to contribute to its erection and enjoy the sense of satisfaction and pride that comes from so doing, we believe that every one of our more than 100,000 members will want to make a contribution and thus become in reality a part owner in this Relief Society home and Latter-day Saint women's memorial edifice. We believe that throughout the Church are many men, as well, who will welcome the opportunity to honor a wife or mother by contributing funds, and that many other friends of Relief Society will wish to show their regard for the Society by assisting financially. Through the united support of all, we believe that the necessary finances will be readily and willingly contributed. We realize, however, that to erect the type of building we have in mind is a mammoth undertaking. We know that if we are to realize our ambition the full support of every enrolled member of Relief Society will be necessary. We would like at this time to know your attitude toward the proposed building program. Therefore, just as our sisters of long ago called for a vote on this identical proposition, so today, forty-nine years later, we too are calling for a vote of this great congregation composed of Relief Society women of our day representing most of the stakes and many of the missions of the Church. Your General Board proposes the erection at the earliest possible date of a Relief Society building that shall be monumental and beautiful, to adequately serve the members of the Society not only for today but in the years to come. Will all those in favor of this proposition please show it by the uplifted hand. (The vote was unanimous in the affirmative.) This is a glorious experience, not only to see your uplifted hands but to feel your support. As soon as plans for the building and its financing are perfected and approved they will be released to you. We feel assured of your support. We appreciate your support in all of the work of Relief Society. We are grateful for your righteousness and your spirit of service. We are grateful for the strength of your testimonies. We are grateful for the women of the past, for their vision and understanding of the needs of Latter-day Saint women, and for their great contribution to us and to the future. We are above all things grateful for the gospel. May the Lord bless you and comfort you and may our righteous and worthy ambitions know fulfillment I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. [The address by President George Albert Smith, page 715, was then delivered. ] Success to a Relief Society Building Elder Marvin O. Ash ton First Counselor, Presiding Bishopric SUCCESS to you in this building! May you speedily start, and may you speedily finish it. If we are perfectly honest with your, and sometimes we are, we would say something like this to President Spafford, \"Success to you in this building,\" and, as the host said to those guests he had in the house as he went into the closet to take out their coats, \"Here's your hat, but what's your hurry?\" Our building over there is crowded. You need a new building and so do we need more elbow room. Success to you! I wish that every building that is financed would be financed as easily as you are going to finance this building; and I hope I have the privilege, and I am sure it won't be denied, to give my pittance in this direction. In closing, inasmuch as President Smith has mentioned the Lamanites, I just want to pay tribute to a Relief Society worker; namely. Sister Flora Hicks, who has had charge, with her husband, of the Lamanites in the Papago Ward, Arizona. She was called down there ten or twelve years ago, and she passed away about eight weeks ago. We had the privilege of standing in that house as those Lamanites came in to pay homage to her. They are supposed to be cold; they are not supposed to be very enthusiastic in their emotions. When those people came in, about three hundred strong, one at a time and in groups, they cried like babies in the loss of that wonderful woman and what she had done for them. And as they put her under the ground, the little Lamanite president of the Relief Society put fifty dollars in the hands of Brother Hicks. They heard that he had had some intention of moving back to Salt Lake City sometime. She said, \"Here is fifty dollars, and men have another fifty dollars. That is for a monument to this good woman. You are not going to move her from this sacred soil?\" God bless her memory. She gave herself to help other persons raise their standards of life. God bless you. Amen. Relief Society Wheat Project Elder Joseph L. Wirthlin Second Counselor, Presiding Bishopric THERE is no question but what I should like to talk to you for a you sisters have missed a great moment about a project in which many things in not being able to at you are vitally interested, namely, tend the sessions of the general the wheat storage project which conference during the past four originated in the days of President years, but I should like you to know Brigham Young when he counseled that we have missed you very much, the members of the Relief Society and we are happy that you are back, to store wheat against a day of need. If we were to continue attending In that day of long ago, the sisters general conference without our sis of the Relief Society went out into the fields after the brethren had harvested the crops and literally gleaned what was left, and from that day on until 1919, the sisters of the Relief Society had been accumulating wheat which eventually amounted to thousands of bushels. The Federal Government, in 1919, proposed the purchase of this wheat, and it was sold to the Government for the sum of approximately $400,000. With the approval of the First Presidency, the money was placed in trust in the Presiding Bishop's office with the understanding that this money would be invested in such a way as to insure its safety and return some interest. Over the years the interest has been paid to the Relief Societies of the Church, who in turn have used it for maternity and child welfare work. But about four years ago, the First Presidency deemed it advisable to invest the money again in wheat to the end that should there come a day of need, some provision would be made to provide for the members of the Church. Hence, a large elevator was erected on Welfare Square with welfare labor, which holds approximately 250,000 bushels of wheat. A small elevator was purchased at Levan, Utah, and another one at McCammon, Idaho. The recently purchased flour mill at Kaysville has an additional storage capacity of 72,000 bushels. At the present time the Relief Society has stored in the Salt Lake Elevator and the one at Levan approximately 215,000 bushels of wheat which has a value at the present market price of over $200,000, and there is a sizable amount of the original wheat funds that has not yet been invested in wheat.\nAs we contemplate this achievement by the women of the Church, the effort required, it represents to\nall of us a grand and glorious achievement. More than that, it represents the principle of generosity and willingness to provide the staff of life for any members of the Church who might be in need. It is further evidence of the divine power that inspires men and women to do those things which are for the spiritual and temporal benefit of the Church.\nAND now as you approach a new project in the way of a building for the women of the Church, there will be no question about your success and the final accomplishment of your objective. No doubt when this building project gets underway, the brethren of the Church will be given the privilege to contribute to the fund that will cover the cost of the building as an expression of appreciation and gratitude for the splendid service rendered by this great organization of women.\nMy mother was a Relief Society president. I say, \"God bless her for her devoted service,\" for out of the service rendered in this great organization, she set her children an example which instilled in their hearts a love for the gospel of Jesus Christ. When I think of these ministering angels of the Relief Society, the words of the song just rendered express best the spirit in which they labor: \"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you, not as the world gives, give I unto you.\" The spirit of the Master motivates this great organization of our sisters to render a service which causes all of us to say, \"God bless them.\"\nMay God bless you in all of your endeavors, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent December 1, and December 15, 1885 \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations\" ADVICE TO MOTHERS: Mothers, and those who have the care of young children and infants, should remember to be in school themselves every day of their lives, for even the infant imbibes the spirit of her who attends it day by day and hour by hour; delicacy and refinement should guard every action, for, be assured, the plastic soul will bear the impress given! Language, also, should ever be guarded, that no words or exclamations may fall upon the infant ear, but that which is sweet, harmonious, and loving.... You, young mothers, remember day by day and hour by hour the mighty responsibility that rests upon you.... Devote, at least, the next twenty years to maturing and educating your children; this will be to you the finest school on earth.?Hannah T. King. CHRISTMAS: Christmas approaches, and as the merry season draws near, our thoughts revert to a period... When the Eternal Son of God, the mighty Savior of the world, condescended to become the babe of Bethlehem, and descend below all things, that He might bring about the great scheme of redemption, and open up the way whereby a fallen world could be restored to the presence of the Father... He came unto his own, and his own received him not.... Then, when another Christmas day dawns upon the earth, let us remember the Holy One who has again restored the Gospel to the earth... Let us as Latter-day Saints, seek after the spirit of Him whose birth we celebrate, and strive to do the works that He did.... In this way we shall ourselves receive a blessing, and give to all a happy Christmas.? Phebe C. Young. WINTER: Winter at last is here in pomp and magnificence; it has ushered itself in. The beautiful carpet of grass has been replaced by one of pure white snow.... Who does not love, as in the evening they are seated before a cosy fire, to hear the wild winds of winter first coming like a low, moaning whisper, then louder, shriller, and more fierce.... Again, who does not love to view the trees on a clear frosty morning; they stand forth draped in their pure white robes of snow.... All, all in loveliness.... I thank God that I have been given an appreciative mind to enjoy all this loveliness of nature.?Ida. A CHRISTMAS PRAYER Enlighten, comfort, sanctify my heart, Sweeten my temper and subdue my will. I want to bring my sisters to thy throne, I want to love and honor Christ alone, I want to feel the spirit's inward power. And stand prepared for death's important hour.  I want to do whatever God requires, I want a heart to burn with pure desires. Lead me through life to glorify thy grace, And after death to see Thee face to face. -M. A.

Page 757 EDITORIAL \n\nVOL. 32 DECEMBER 1945 NO. 12 116th Semi-annual Church Conference  COLORFUL and impressive was the scene in Salt Lake City on the morning of October 5, 1945, the opening day of the 116th semi-annual conference of the Church. All roads appeared to lead to Temple Square as thousands of Latter-day Saints, conference bound, hearts rejoicing in the blessing of our Heavenly Father, eagerly anticipated words which would soon come from inspired Church leaders to guide, comfort, and sustain them. Four weary, anxious war years had passed since the general Church membership had met in the great Tabernacle in conference session, years in which souls had been tried and many had been called upon to mourn. The resumption of conference for the general Church membership, made possible through the cessation of hostilities, was indeed a comfort to the souls of Latter-day Saints, and a joy to their hearts. This conference, too, was an eventful occasion for a most important and impressive ceremony, one participated in by the priesthood and general membership but rarely a ceremony referred to in Church history as a Priesthood Solemn Assembly. Page 758 This ceremony is the custom when voting for a new president of the Church for the first time in general conference, and has been the practice of the Church since President John Taylor was sustained in conference general conference. Voting is by quorums, in order, beginning with the First Presidency and continuing down through the Aaronic Priesthood. Voting by the priesthood is followed by that of the remaining Church membership. In voting, the right hand is raised to the square to witness to the Lord that one sustains the officer for whom he is voting. The Solemn Assembly, presided over by President George Albert Smith and directed by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. At the opening session of the conference October 5, voted to sustain President George Albert Smith as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Smith came to this position on May 21, 1945, following the death of President Heber J. Grant. The humility of soul, accompanied by the power that comes with a deep and abiding testimony of the gospel, confirmed in the minds of the thousands who heard the voice of President Smith as he addressed the Church membership following the voting, the belief that they had indeed sustained one who was a prophet, seer, and revelator divinely appointed and endowed with divine authority to lead the Church in this great and perilous day. The Church membership also EDITORIAL 759 sustained President George F. Richards as president of the Council of the Twelve, and Elder Matthew Cowley as a new member of the Council of the Twelve. Strong and effective, and a terse reminder to the saints of the covenants they had made that day in voting were the words of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. When he said: Today I have given witness to President Smith, to you and to the Lord that I will sustain him as prophet, seer and revelator and president of the Church. Each of us has made a life covenant. God gives to each of us the strength and the power to be loyal; to give up fault finding; to follow the command of the Lord; to follow those whom we have ourselves sustained. Without leadership the Church cannot grow. Throughout all of the sessions of the conference, speakers paid high tribute to President Smith. With unusual clarity and conviction they bore testimony, expounded the doctrines and interpreted the principles of the gospel, and bade Church members to keep the commandments of the Lord. Pronounced emphasis was given the missionary program of the Church and the intention to expand it in the immediate future?to call many men and women into missionary service, was made clear. The music of the conference seemed unusually beautiful. Relief Society was proud that a combined chorus of Relief Society Singing Mothers from the stakes of the Salt Lake Region provided the music for the first two sessions. The desires of the thousands of Latter-day Saints who had so eagerly awaited this conference for the guidance and spiritual succor it might bring them were fully realized. This 116th semi-annual conference will go down in Church history as a great and blessed occasion. BSS. CHRISTMAS WISH Helen Kimball Orgill I wish I had dwelt in Bethlehem in that long ago, To greet those lonely strangers, with weary feet and slow. I wish I had been near Mary, her every wish to attend, To comfort and to love her, when needing most a friend. But these are vain desires, and never meant for me? Around are other pilgrims on life's upsurging sea. His heart is yearning over them?I hear again his plea: Ye do it to the least ones, ye do it unto me! Christmas in the Bible WHAT shall we do on Christmas Eve? What shall we do when the fire blazes high upon the hearth and candles flame in the window? Beyond that window, in the darkness, stars line the black arch of night. Perhaps, far away or near at hand, in the hills, modern shepherds watch their flocks by night. And here we are at home on Christmas Eve thinking about these things. There is no better way to enjoy this evening than to spend it reading the story of Christmas as it is written in the beautiful words of the Bible. Let these words be read aloud and pondered again, for there is need of their serenity and comfort?a great need for their steadfast message of hope: Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him (Matthew 2:1-2). These are the words of St. Matthew, telling the wonderful story of the first Christmas. And the wise men, near the end of their journey, when they had conferred with Herod in Jerusalem, \"departed: and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.\" The story continues, and we can almost see the starlight upon the hill road to Bethlehem, the tall camels silhouetted against the night, the city walls lighted with splendor. It is Luke who gives the exquisite description of the shepherds: And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night (Luke 2:8). Above the desert and the Dead Sea, above the desolate wilderness, safe in the coves of the hills, these shepherds watched their flocks, careful that no lamb wandered into the ravines, careful that no ewe escaped from the walls of the fold. Peaceful were the shepherds and the sheep upon the dark hills. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them. Fear not: for, behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord (Luke 2:9-11). A message for all the world. Christmas as the Bible tells the story! There is no substitute for these words. Nothing can take their place. Before the waning of this Christmas Eve, read this message of the four gospels. The Christmas spirit will come to you across the gulf of time, across the interval of centuries, and there will be no boundaries of time or space. Christmas will be yours! V. P. C. And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER VII SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, trying to find a way to lessen the stigma when her friends will learn that she has been jilted by Hugh Temple, finds that Alec Windsor, a marine on furlough in the town, is attracted to her. She believes that she can make the people in the town think that she has been the one to break off her engagement with Hugh if she pretends to be in love with Alec, Jeff Holden, father of two motherless children, tells Delsa that he loves her, but Delsa thinks that Jeff is merely lonely for his dead wife. ON Saturday morning Delsa rose early to help her mother do the weekly wash. Sometimes, as this morning, she wished she could lie in bed, warm and safe and far from all the troubles and duties of the world about her. But the wash must be done, and her mother, strong and well as she was, could not be expected to do it alone while Delsa loafed in bed. At least, Delsa couldn't expect her mother to work while she rested, so she tossed off the covers, dressed quickly in a faded blue gingham, and went downstairs. 'The clothes will dry quickly in this sun and wind,\" her mother said happily. \"We should be all through by ten o'clock.\" \"Oh, if we are, Fm going for a long horseback ride,\" Delsa cried. \"It will be wonderful up the canyon today?buds just bursting, grass so new and green!\" They worked swiftly, talking of the wedding and of Alec Windsor and of all the neighbors, whose affairs seemed so much a part of their own daily lives. Long before ten, Delsa was hanging the clothes?the morning sun slanting against her brown curls, turning them to fine gold; the wind whipping her gingham dress about her slim young body. Shaking the sheets like white wings about her shoulders, Delsa gave them a little tug and laughed aloud for the sheer joy of hanging clean clothes in sunlight and wind. \"That does it!\" She was startled at the exclamation and turned, to see Alec Windsor on his knee at one side of her, a kodak tipped at a rakish angle, as he swiftly recorded the picture before him. \"Oh, Alec!\" Delsa cried, flushing, \"I look a sight! Why don't you wait?\" \"A sight to be remembered?a sight to be recorded in koda chrome!\" Alec laughed, getting up from the soft ground and coming close to her. \"That was a beautiful picture, Delsa. I think, if you'll give me permission, I'll enter it in some nation-wide contest. Pick up a little money, and make the world happier at the same time.\" \"Better sell it for advertising,\" Delsa mocked. \"Use Sunny Monday soap chips!\" \"It'd make me a fortune,\" he said seriously. Page  He picked up the wicker clothes basket and carried it to the house for her. \"What you going to do once the washing's all hung?\" he asked. \"Oh?nothing much, I guess,? Delsa answered. Her mother heard the question and said, \"I thought you were going for a horseback ride, Delsa. Maybe Alec would like to ride, too. Do you ride, Alec?\" \"I?ll say,\" he laughed, \"have you an extra horse?\" \"There's Hugh's horse in the barn,\" Mrs. Marriott went on happily, thinking she was doing Delsa and Alec and Hugh, too, a good turn. DELSA was a little annoyed. She'd planned to ride up to her's and Hugh's \"thinking spot\"?a big flat boulder that stuck out from the face of the hill east of the ranch, where the two had often sat and pondered on life and death and the weighty problems of youngsters and adolescents. She had wanted to be alone this morning, to think, to plan, to decide. But now she would be with Alec?maybe it would be even more pleasant. She smiled up at him. \"Why don't you come with me, Alec? I can show you the whole valley from the hillside up there,\" and she motioned toward the east. \"I can put up a few sandwiches and some cake and a thermos of milk,\" Mrs. Marriott went on eagerly. \"It's warm enough for a picnic. You'd like that, wouldn't you. Alec? Most boys love picnics.\" So an hour later, Delsa on her little blue mare and Alec on Hugh's roan were climbing up through the pale green brush toward the boulder that would give them a view of the valley. When they reached the spot, Delsa dismounted and let Blue Star's reins trail. Alec swung down from Beauty's back, and came and stood beside her. The mid-day sun was warm, and Delsa took off her bandanna and let her hair blow free. \"Isn't the valley lovely?\" she asked. \"I don't believe there's a more beautiful place in the whole wide world.\" Alec looked out over the scene spread below him. The valley stretched from north to south, like a long tortoise-shell cat stretched on a rock, sunning itself. The plowed farms were the dark spots on her fur; the wheat stubble the lighter blotches. Back of the sunning valley rose another chain of hills, golden in the spring sun. \"Tt is lovely,\" Alec breathed. Delsa sat down on the boulder, and was grateful for the warmth that the sun had given it and for the peace of the position high above the world. \"This is my favorite spot,\" she said dreamily. Alec sat down beside her, very' close. \"You come here often, I guess,\" he said. \"Whenever I can't stand the valley?but that isn't often,\" she murmured. \"Can't stand the valley?\" he asked, inviting her confidence. \"Oh, you know how it is, where you know everyone and everyone knows you. Sometimes you feel that they are too close, too interested. You want to get away.\" \"Why didn't you get a teaching AND FOR ETERNITY 763 position some other place, then?\" The question was gentle. 'If it hadn't been for the war, I probably would have done so,\" Del-sa said musingly. \"But as it was? well, you see so many parents losing their children because they have to, you don't feel like bringing that loss upon your own when it isn't necessary.\" \"You're sweet, Delsa,\" Alec whispered. He picked up her hand, where it lay open beside her, and gently turned it over. The slender golden band that was Hugh's pledge to her, gleamed upon her slim brown finger; the tiny diamond glistening in the sun. Alec touched it, questioningly. \"Does this mean so much to you, Delsa, that you cannot forget it for a moment?\" DELSA looked down at the ring and slowly shook her head. \"It is the symbol of a pledge,\" she said softly. Alec's voice became urgent. \"If you need a symbol,\" he began, \"the pledge must not be real to you-\" \"But I have the symbol,\" she pointed out quietly. \"If I slipped it from your finger-let it roll down there among the rocks and brush below us?what of the pledge then? Delsa lifted her eyes to his and the question he had asked was repeated in the clear blue irises. Then she shook her head wonderingly. \"Would it be as easy as that?\" she asked softly. \"Delsa!\" Alec cried, \"Delsa! You don't love him!\" \"Oh, I do! I do! I've loved him all my life long, Alec. I'll love him as long as I have life.\" \"IT love you like that, Delsa,\" Alec whispered, \"and I've known you only for days. Delsa, darling, I want to marry you. I want to have a little happiness ?I want something to cling to?Who knows whether your Hugh will ever come back? Who knows whether I will ever come back? You deserve happiness, Delsa. We could find it together.\" \"Hugh must come back, some day,\" Delsa said, and her throat ached, knowing that when he came he would bring his wife with him, \"and so must you. Alec,\" she added softly. \"I'd want to, more than ever, if I had you to come back to.\" \"Alec, Alec! You are pledged, too!\" Alec's mouth grew hard and bitter. \"Yes, I'm pledged. But when can I keep that pledge? I didn't ask Helen to marry me, just so that 1 could have the pleasure of being engaged. I wanted to be married. I hurried home to marry her. But she was gone. I may never see her again.\" Delsa shook her head sadly. What could she answer? She knew how he felt ?young and eager and lonely. He wanted arms about him; he wanted love. She felt strangely older than this boy beside her. She understood so well that he was crying, not to her as a sweetheart, so much as to her as a woman?a woman who could take his mother's place, and, holding him in her arms, comfort his loneliness, wipe away his fears. \"I'd return to you, Delsa. I'd love you all my life long,\" he pleaded. \"And after that?\" she asked. \"After that?\" he shrugged, \"Well, we take our chances.\" Delsa shook her head. \"Not with us. Alec,\" she said. He looked at her, the urgency still bright in his eyes. \"What do you mean?\" \"If you married me, Alec, it would have to be as we marry in our Church, for time and for eternity. Would you want me for eternity, Alec, if Helen were there, too, not separated by distance and time as she is here?\" ALEC'S arms went about her and drew her close and his importunate lips were pressed upon her mouth. When she drew back, he said, \"You love me, Delsa, I can feel it. Let's not worry about tomorrow, or the hereafter, or anything else. Let's take what we can take?we'll have that much, anyway, and nothing?neither time nor eternity?can rob us of it once it is ours.\" But Delsa's yielding, sympathetic mood had passed, and she withdrew from his arms, rising lithely. \"We came for a picnic. Alec,\" she said, \"Let's see what Mom put in our lunch?\" She went over to Blue Star and took the canvas bag from the saddle. Alec sat moodily staring out over the valley while she laid a cloth and placed sandwiches and cake and the thermos of milk before him. He looked like an unhappy small boy, and she could not refrain from stooping as she passed him, and laying a light kiss upon his frowning brow. He looked up then, and a smile as bright as sunshine chased the dark look from his eyes. \"Right!\" he cried, and set to work on the lunch. Delsa laughed with him and talked lightly as they ate and later as they rode down the trail together. But she was not happy. The little dialogue there on the boulder, high above the valley, had showed her many things. What these were she couldn't tell just yet ? she would have to be alone, she would have to take out the thoughts that were so jumbled now, smooth them out, and examine them, and find out just what they meant. She didn't get an opportunity to do this until she went to her room that night. There, kneeling in her accustomed place by the window, so that she could look out and see Hugh's old window gleaming in the moonlight, she tried to think. She took Hugh's ring from her finger and looked at it. Was it true that she needed a symbol of her pledge to Hugh and his pledge to her? Was it easier for Hugh to break that pledge because he had no ring to remind him? If that was true, then the thing she had been telling herself all along was not true?that their engagement was binding as a marriage vow, that Hugh had no more right to break it than he would have to violate his marriage pledge. \"Yes,\" she whispered at last, \"I have been wrong. If we had married, Hugh and I, it would have been a sacred rite, in God's temple?a vow taken before him, and never to be broken. Our promises to each other were not the same?they required this ring, this shining diamond to remind me of them. Hugh, Hugh, AND FOR ETERNITY 765 forgive me! I know in my heart that if you had taken those other vows, you would have been true to them. It was my fault, perhaps, for not marrying you before you left. Or maybe it was so intended. But however it came to be, you were free to change, Hugh. You had that right. And you acted honorably in writing to me as you did. Oh, Hugh, I see now that I can write to you at last and release you from your promise to me.\" She laid her forehead against the window sill and held Hugh's ring in her hand, watching it, while the sense of being wronged and cheated slowly dissolved in her heart. I still love Hugh, she thought wonderingly, I think I love him even more than I did before. I love him so much that I want him to be happy?I don't want him to feel lost and afraid as Alec feels right now. And if that Australian girl can comfort him?if her real arms mean more to him than the memory of mine? then I want him to have them. She shook her head slowly. I hope she loves you, Hugh, truly loves you. I hope she isn't marrying you because she feels the compassion for you that I felt for Alec today-She stopped on that thought, \"compassion\"; then she repeated it softly, \"compassion. Is that all I feel for Alec? Is that all that his need awakens in me? Compassion? Could that sustain us through time ? and through eternity?\" She sat there a long time after that, looking out into the night, not even thinking. But at last she rose and went slowly across the room to her dressing table. She carefully put Hugh's ring in a small box and put this in the top drawer, and shut the drawer slowly, surely. Then she went to her bed, and the smooth white pillow was not cooler nor more quiet than her own cheek against it. (To he continued) VOLUNTEER PRICE CONTROL SERVICE THE battle to keep prices down is still going on. Strong inflationary pressures are still with us and will be until the supply of goods can catch up with the demand. Experience has taught us that the greatest danger lies ahead. The cost of living continued to rise after World War I, reaching its highest point during the months immediately following the armistice. Help is needed in preventing a recurrence of this experience. Returning servicemen and war workers seeking new jobs, as well as all other citizens, should be protected from inflation and the economic depression which inevitably follows. Relief Society women should keep informed on the latest announcements on rationing and price control which touch the lives of all of us. Relief Society members who personally wish to help may do so by offering assistance to the local Price Control Boards, or by responding when a special call is made for volunteers as tliey are needed. A few hours of time each month, spent in making price surveys at nearby stores or doing clerical work at a Board office, \\\\dll be of benefit.

Wayne Diiggs For Tuesday, March 5, 1946 Objective: To develop the truth that the gospel is ours, but we must strive to carry it to others. IT is paradoxical to learn in life that often the best things we keep by giving them away. In imparting knowledge to others the teacher himself learns. By kind acts to fellow beings one gains in personal kindliness. Love itself is reciprocal. Does not God's gift of his Only Begotten Son forever draw us nearer the Eternal Father? Knowing the strength of this seeming inconsistency, the Lord has always set men's minds upon service to be rendered, rather than personal profits to be gained. \"But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant\" (Matt. 23:11). These were his words to the disciples. With the establishment of his kingdom in the latter days, there has come the same opportunity to serve. Hardly had the Church been organized when the call was given to Parley P. Pratt and his companions to go upon a mission to the Laman-ites (Doc. And Gov. 32). And ever since that October in the year 1830, servants of the Lord in steadily increasing numbers have gone forth to preach the gospel, only to find that they, in turn, have become more converted to the faith. Nor have there been any limits set as to the distances these present-day disciples of the Lord were to carry the message of salvation. As in the days of Peter, so now the passage reads: Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world (Matt. 28:19-20). It is good to have the comfort of the last thought the Lord gave in this injunction. He is always to be with his servants. Missionaries by the hundreds from the year 1830 to the present day have learned,. Through personal experiences, the need for such a priceless companion. The work of the elder or seventy has always been difficult. Page 767  Bitter opposition to the word of God has caused his servants much suffering and misery, even death.\nWhen the first missionaries were sent to England in 1837, the forces of evil which blind the eyes of men were most dramatically made real. Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde and Willard Richards saw legions of devils and felt their physical violence. With hatred toward these brethren for the priesthood they held, and bitterness for the gospel they were to bring to the British people, the fiends of darkness assailed the missionaries. Elder Kimball was knocked senseless to the floor. He recalls the happening in these words:\nI was struck with great force by some invisible power, and fell senseless to the floor. The first thing I recollected was being supported by Elders Hyde and Richards, who were praying for me . . . Elders Hyde and Richards then assisted me to get on the bed . . . when a vision was opened to our minds, and we could distinctly see the evil spirits, who foamed and gnashed their teeth at us. We gazed upon them about an hour and a half (by Willard's watch). We were not looking towards the window, but towards the corner of the room. Elder Richards finally saw the devils coming with their legions, who came towards us like armies rushing to battle. They appeared to be men of full stature, possessing every form and feature of men in the flesh who are angry and desperate; and I shall never forget the vindictive malignity depicted on their countenances as they looked me in the eye; . . . We distinctly heard those spirits talk and express their wrath and hellish designs against us. However, the Lord delivered us from them, and blessed us exceedingly that day (Doc. and Cov. Commentary, page 634; ORSON F. WHITNEY, Life of Heber C. Kimball, page 144).\nThe majority of the missionaries who have gone forth on their good tidings, while not encountering such exceptional experiences with the spirit world, have, nevertheless, seen the flames of hatred for God's work in the eyes of ill-informed men and women. The malice planted in their hearts by the adversary in the case of some nonbelievers has led to overt acts of violence. To be a Mormon missionary at times has meant not to be sure of life itself.\nThere is a love for the truth, however, which makes men brave. One day, they know, every soul must acknowledge Christ. This it is, among other things, that keeps those who have accepted the good word forever trying. The express command from the Lord, too, that his word must be preached puts an obligation upon the Church to have elders abroad in missionary service.\nAs we have followed the history of the saints from Palmyra to Salt Lake Valley, often amid their most dire trials has come the call for men to leave their homes and go abroad to preach the gospel. Through the service of home missionaries within the missions and the stakes of Zion, hundreds of faithful Latter-day Saints, not called up on to devote all their time to preaching the gospel, are also spending many hours seeking out the honest in heart. A steadily increasing number of converts are thus coming into the Church through these laborers. Even the recruiting of the Mormon Battalion in the year 1846 was not without its missionary service. Just so, today, our boys abroad in the armed forces are in the most real sense bearers of the truth. Their lives, when held in line with the teachings of the Church, will add to the glory of the latter-day work. \nLESSON DEPARTMENT 769 Before giving a few excerpts from the journals of early missionaries of the Church, let us look at the names and dates of the major missions opened over the earth, since Elder Heber C. Kimball and his companions first went to the British Isles in 1837. Most of this work*of the gathering of Israel was underway before the turn of the century in 1900. There are two dates before 1837 which should be mentioned again. One is 1830, which marks the first mission of all which was the one to the Lamanites. Oliver Cowdery, Parley P. Pratt, and Ziba Peterson were sent at that time. Six years later. Elder Pratt and others opened the mission to Canada. Orson Hyde went to Palestine in 1841; Noah Rogers and others to the Society Islands in 1844; and Erastus Snow to Scandinavia in 1850. Four other missions were opened in this same year, the French by John Taylor, the Italian by Lorenzo Snow, the Swiss by T. B. H. Stenhouse, and the Hawaiian by George Q. Cannon and companions. The following year three other countries were added to the foregoing fields: South America by Parley P. Pratt; Australia by John Murdock and Charles W. Wandell; and India. In 1853, Elders Jesse Haven, Leonard Smith and William Walker went to South Africa. In 1854 AA Zealand was opened; in 1861 the Netherlands, in 1888 Samoa, and in 1901 President Heber J. Grant opened the Japanese field. The harvest was ripe during the beginning years of the missionary work of the Restored Church. Parley P. Pratt records in his journal the following concerning the number of saints to leave England for Zion: Between the middle of September [1840] and my own embarkation in October, I chartered three vessels for New Orleans and filled them with the migrating Saints viz.: The 'Sidney/ with one hundred and eighty souls; the 'Medford/ with two hundred and fourteen souls; and the 'Henry,' with one hundred and fifty-seven. I next chartered the 'Emerald' on which I placed about two hundred and fifty passengers, including myself and family (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, page 361). Next to England, no field has been more fruitful than the Scandinavian. For a glimpse of the early mission encounters in that vineyard one may well turn to the journal of Andrew Jenson who served for many years as assistant Church historian. He relates this experience on the island of Mors in the province of Jutland, Denmark, under the date of July 1874. Bitter opposition had been encountered by the missionaries there before the incident here given was recorded. It was on a Friday evening that the two missionaries met on the Nykjobing wharf, and instead of putting up in the little city, they struck out in the country at once. Night found them in the village of Jorsby, ten miles to the north, where they found friends who kept them over night. Early the next morning the house, in which they had slept, was approached by a crowd of fishermen hailing from the west coast of Jutland. They had been out on the fjord fishing, but a storm had compelled them to seek shelter for a day or so in the village, which was situated on the east coast of the island. These men were known to be a rough set, and when the owner of the house where the missionaries stopped saw them approaching in their long watertight boots, their short jackets and heads covered with huge fishermen's storm caps, he felt alarmed, fearing that they came for the purpose of ill-treating his guests; and so expressed himself to them, but the young Utah elder told him not to fear, as nobody would get hurt. A loud rap on the door, a response of \"vaer saa god\" (please step in), and in filed a dozen or more strong, weather-beaten sailors, who immediately introduced themselves in their own peculiar way by saying that they had come out of pure curiosity to see the man from Utah, whom they had been informed stopped at the house. \"Then I am perhaps the man you look for,\" said the young elder, as he rose from the table and shook hands with them all. \"I shall be pleased to answer any proper question you may wish to put to me concerning Utah and her people\" (Autobiography of Andrew Jenson, page 75). The distant travels of Elder George Q. Cannon to the Hawaiian people in the year 1850 opened one of the most colorful chapters in the story of missionary endeavor of the Church. It was the Book of Mormon, the greatest of missionary aids, that so often comforted Elder Cannon and his companions just as it has done hundreds of others of the Lord's servants. From his writings entitled \"My First Mission,\" chapters 12 and 16, the following excerpts are taken: Before I commenced holding regular meetings, I had plenty of time for meditation, and to review all the events of my short life, and to think of the beloved home from which I was so far separated. It was then that I found the value of the Book of Mormon. It was a book which I always loved. But I learned there to appreciate it as I had never done before. If I felt inclined to be lonely, to be low spirited, or homesick, I had only to turn to its sacred pages to receive consolation, new strength and a rich out-pouring of the Spirit Scarcely a page that did not contain encouragement for such as I was. The salvation of man was the great theme upon which its writers dwelt, and for this they were willing to undergo every privation and make every sacrifice. What were my petty difficulties compared with those afflictions which they had to endure? If I expected to share the glory for which they contended, I could see that I must labor in the same spirit. If the sons of King Mosiah could relinquish their high estate, and go forth among the degraded Lamanites to labor as they did, should not I labor with patience and devoted zeal for the salvation of these poor red men, heirs of the same promise? Let me recommend this book, therefore, to young and old, if they need comfort and encouragement. Especially can I recommend it to those who are away from home on missions. No man can read it, partake of its spirit and obey its teachings, without bein\" filled with a deep love for the souls of men and a burning zeal to do all in his power to save them.... The conversations, which I had with the natives concerning the Book of Mormon and the origin of the red men, made them anxious to see it. \"It is truly surprising how soon the work of translation began. The first elders landed at Honolulu in December, 1850. Not long afterwards Elder Cannon deeply desiring to know the language had the gift of interpretation given to him. His progress in the new tongue must have been rapid, for in less than two months he was beginning to put the record of the Nephites before some of their descend ants. He writes: 'In the last days of the month of January, 1851, I commenced the work of translation. My fellow laborers, the elders, encouraged me, and from the First Presidency at home ?Presidents Young, Kimball and Richards?came words of cheer, approving of what I was doing, and counseling me to persevere.' \"Naturally this work of translation could be only a part of the missionary work. Preaching, explaining the doctrines, meeting the opposition raised against them by Christian ministers, baptizing, traveling from place to place, administering to the sick, all had their time and place. LESSON DEPARTMENT 771In reference to his work after returning to Wailuku, where he had first found a friendly reception, and from which place he had removed to save his friend, J. H. Napela, from the persecution of the Presbyterian minister, who had so bitterly opposed the work, Elder Cannon writes: ?The preaching of the gospel created great excitement; the people came by hundreds to hear the testimony, and I had the satisfaction of seeing the missionary who had treated me so badly and who had so bitterly opposed and lied about the work, almost deserted by his congregation; they having left his church to hear us preach and see us baptize.... We baptized a large number of people at Wailuku and the adjacent towns, erected a large meeting-house at that place and smaller ones at the other villages, and organized large and flourishing branches of the Church!' \" (Joseph J. Cannon, \"George A. Cannon,\" Instructor, October '44, pages 456-458). Though the darkening shadow of war robbed the world of nearly all but home missionaries, yet the day will come again when the elders of Israel will resume their efforts to carry the gospel to the nations of the world. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word.\" 1. Discuss the work of the seventies in relation to the missionary program of the Church (See Doc. And Cov. 107:25). 2. Have class members who are familiar with missionary work conducted at centers such as Temple Square, Hill Cumorah, etc., tell what they know of this work. 3. It has been said that once a person is a Mormon he is always a Mormon. Though this is not entirely true, there is enough basis for fact in it to cause one to ask?Why.\" Discuss this question. 4. As a people we are ever ready to explain our faith to others. Why? Read the word of the Lord to three of the early members of the Church and note the one charge he gave to all of them (Doc. And Cov. 4; 6:1-9; 11). 5. Read Doc. And Cov. 46:1-7. Note the attitude of the Lord toward him who is seeking the way of life. 6. Have class members who have filled missions, including home missions, relate interesting missionary experiences. For home study suggest the reading of the missionary experiences of Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, and Jacob Hamblin. (See Three Mormon Classics, compiled by Preston Nibley, available at"

            "content": "General Relief Society Conference, October 4, 1945 \nTHIS is a very unusual sight and also an unusual experience. No other organization in the world of women can present such a picture as you have here today?this famous building filled with the daughters of our Heavenly Father. To have this meeting in the Tabernacle, with a great organ that is known all over the world, and to enjoy the great chorus of Singing Mothers make this an event that we will all remember.\nI congratulate the women's Relief Society that was begun by the Prophet Joseph Smith upon being the only organization in all the world that was organized by a Prophet of God to represent the women of the Church. While you may feel that at one time you were a long way from the center of so-called civilization, the fact is that today you are the center of civilization.\nRelief Society Building\nThis is an occasion that I enjoy just as much as you do. I have been waiting for the last four or five years to see this large group assemble in general conference. If you are going to have a house large enough to hold yourselves from now on, you may as well plan to build it. I am delighted to have had some thinking of erecting such a structure.\nDon't you think it would be appropriate for you women of the Church of Jesus Christ, the only Church that bears his name by divine authority, to have a home of your own into which you could invite the spirit of the Lord when you hold your meetings? I realize you have been disappointed in the past; you thought you had a home once before, but it turned out to be the Presiding Bishop's office also. But now your prospect seems to be better, and as you think about it and plan for it, you will be very happy. I don't care how fine it is, how large it is, or how beautiful it is; it will not be better than you deserve. There isn't anything too good for you as long as you keep the commandments of the Lord. You know he said, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\"\nI am thinking today of the desirability of a house that will be the headquarters for the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You may be sure that if you do your part, the Lord will do his. I am sure it will be a satisfaction to some of you who do not have homes of your own to know that there is a house in which to have an interest where you can meet and have enjoyment in the company of your sisters. It will be a gratifying experience for the daughters of Zion to feel that they have been able to provide themselves a suitable home, and that day is not far away. Until that time comes, I am happy that there is a house as fine as this that is our Father's house, in which we can all meet and know that his spirit is present.\nThe Influence of Relief Society\nThe seven or eight thousand women here today are but a small part of your membership. It is a large congregation to be sure, but do you realize that the daughters of Zion are the mothers of a group twelve times as large as this that has been serving their country in the armed forces of the United States? The mothers of the nation gave their sons to America. It was the mothers of the Church who offered what was dearer than life itself to them. He said to their sons, \"It is your duty under the Constitution of our land and the recommendations of the Church with which we are identified, to go and help preserve the liberty of the world.\" So today, as large as this audience is, the group that is coming back to you will be twelve times as large, every one of them a representative of the daughters and the mothers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they have made a wonderful record for you. The letters that have come home, I am sure, have filled your hearts with joy. Satisfaction has filled your soul when the commendation of superior officers has been extended to many of those that belong to you. And now, in the merciful providence of our Father, the war is finished, and by the shipload your\nsons will be returning home; and what a wonderful thing it is to know that most of those sons can return to their mothers after having jeopardized their lives that we all might enjoy the blessings so generously bestowed upon us by a loving Heavenly Father.\nI feel that I am standing on sacred ground, for in this pulpit have appeared some of the great men and women of the world, those who were anxious to do what the Lord desired them to do. Here they bore testimony of the divine mission of our Savior Jesus Christ. I was born across the street from this Tabernacle. So I have seen the beautiful buildings erected here, including the Temple, completed and occupied. We will soon celebrate the one-hundredth anniversary of the coming of the pioneers. The first company came here with all they possessed in covered wagons drawn by the animals that they could secure, oxen that could work their way across the plains, subsisting on wild grass enroute. See what God has wrought in that hundred years! From the most undesirable wilderness you would imagine, this valley has grown to appear as the garden of the Lord.\nI am thinking now of President Brigham Young and his associates with that first company. If they could look down and see the daughters of the people assembled today in peace and thanksgiving and gratitude, how happy they would be. And I imagine they can do that very thing. You have such a diversity of opportunities with the faith that you have. You possess all that the world has that is really essential to eternal happiness, plus the gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord. So I am thinking today how grateful we ought to be. How thankful I am that a little over seventy-five years ago a mother offered her life that the man who is talking to you might be born. When I think of what the women in this Church have passed through in order that the sons and daughters of God might come into the world, I realize that today you have been blessed in so many ways. You do not have the hardships of pioneering your forebears had, and today it is recognized that you are as blessed, and I may say more blessed than any other women in all the world. You were the first women to have the franchise; the first women to have a voice in the work of a church. It was God that gave it to you and it came as a result of revelation to a Prophet of the Lord. Since that time, think what benefits the women of this world have enjoyed. Not only you belonging to the Church have enjoyed the blessing of equality, but when the Prophet Joseph Smith turned the key for the emancipation of womankind, it was turned for all the world, and from generation to generation the number of women who can enjoy the blessings of religious liberty and civil liberty has been increasing.\nSinging Mothers Church-wide\nI thought as I listened to this lovely choir here, you never heard of a choir of Singing Mothers until you heard of it in the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was down in the South Seas a few years ago, in New Zealand, Australia, Samoa, Tonga and Hawaii, and in each of these countries I have listened and\nhere, there were choruses of Singing Mothers. I could not understand the words they sang, except I assumed that the words were suited to the music that we are accustomed to hearing in such songs as \"Come, Come Ye Saints.\"\nIt was delightful to me to know that even though they didn't have comfortable seats to sit on like you folks have, they made no complaints. They often said that as hard as these seats are in the Tabernacle, they are about the most comfortable benches anybody ever sat on. I remember seeing a fine congregation of nearly two thousand natives in Apia, British Samoa. They were in two houses, one that had been built for worship, and then a school building adjoining that could be used in connection with the house of worship. These buildings had large doors like this Tabernacle. Then there was a bowery on one side, making three congregations in one. Instead of having comfortable benches, everybody sat on the floor. It was interesting to see them come in. Men and women would walk in, one carrying a roll of matting made of bark or leaves. They would open it out on the floor and a group would sit down on it; then another would come in with another mat and that would be rolled out and another group would sit on that. When the house was filled and everybody comfortably situated, they would sit and sing, keeping time to the music sometimes by the motion of their hands and bodies. It was a lovely picture, one I had never seen any place before.\nI remember the last night we spent at mission headquarters before leaving for home. After we were in bed, the last thing we could hear was a group singing in one of the nearby native homes. And the next morning when we awoke, they were singing religious songs, not the nonsense we are amazed with over the radio, but they were singing praises and their voices were tuneful. I thought, if you dark-skinned folk can be as happy as you are with the few opportunities that are yours, then how joyful our lives should be in such a country as we have. I have thought of it many times since. The first group of Relief Society sisters that President Rufus K. Hardy and I saw when we arrived at Apia in the Samoan Islands numbered about two hundred. All of them had cream-colored dresses, not white dresses, but they were all dressed in cream-colored dresses made by their own hands. When they learned that we were going to have a big conference there, the women went out in the woods and gathered the bark of the hypo trees. Then they placed this bark on a large log and pounded it with a hardwood club into great sheets that looked like blotting paper. They were able to make this material as large as they wanted by adding to it. When the sheets were large enough, with such knives or scissors as they had, they cut out their dresses, and with the thread that they could make or purchase they sewed their clothing by hand. The only other adornment they had was a necklace that they called ula which was made of tissue paper or some other available material. They were excellent singers; their voices were tuneful and they kept perfect time. I saw another group of your Relief Society women among the Maori people. In the particular case I have in mind, there were three thousand people in the congregation. That was during their Hui tau, or annual conference. They had a chorus of Singing Mothers. They were strong and vigorous; there wasn't a sickly looking woman in the crowd, and how they could sing! I had a picture of sixty of them, and there was not one among that group of sixty women that wasn't the mother of twelve or more children. Children, Treasures in Heaven One of the thoughts that I desire to impress on Relief Society mothers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to teach your sons and daughters that the blessing of God that you may have with you forever will be children?families of children. You will not have any pride in owning automobiles and other material possessions such as we spend so much of our time to acquire, but on the other side of the veil in the celestial kingdom, the Relief Society mother who has brought a family of children into the world and kept them developing until they have graduated to be servants of our Heavenly Father will have treasures in heaven that will outmeasure and outvalue all the treasures of the earth. I would like to pass that on to you. I would also like to suggest to you that we do not have to live like the world does. If we live like the world does, we will become like the world, and when we go to the other side, we will have the reward that the world has. The Lord intended we should \"come out of the world.\" ADDRESS TO MEMBERS OF THE RELIEF SOCIETY 719 He intended that his sons and daughters should have an opportunity to grow up under his inspiration, not under the influence of the adversary. So your forebears and mine, many of them, came across the sea or from other parts of America and sought first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. They settled in this marvelous part of the world that has been the safest place to be found anywhere. You are in the part of the world that has not suffered for any of the necessities of life. Here your children can be educated and have all the opportunities and privileges and blessings in this great land of America. The Lord called this land \"choice above all other lands,\" and when you think of what we enjoy, it is true. But all his children in other lands are precious to him, and it is our duty and our privilege to so measure our facilities and our advantages that we will want to divide with all the children of God the blessings that we enjoy. These Singing Mothers are not just for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints here in the valleys of the mountains; they are for the islands of the sea and the nations of the earth, and as daughters of our Heavenly Father, they have honored him and magnified him in their songs of praise and thanksgiving. Now, I rejoice with you today that you can meet again in the great Tabernacle where peace and quiet and the inspiration of the Lord can be enjoyed. Isn't it lovely to meet together here! This is a beautiful picture. I congratulate you with all my heart that in your first meeting after the close of the war, you can fill the Tabernacle to overflowing. Do you realize you have opened this Tabernacle to the first general conference we have had for years? Only the priesthood officers have been invited during recent conferences. Now the sky is the limit, and I am not so sure but by the time we have two or three more general conferences here, we may have visitors from Australia, New Zealand, Africa, China, Japan, etc. They may leave their homes in airplanes and in about twenty-four hours be right here. It is marvelous what the Lord has given to us in this age. Tribute to Mothers Today I thank him with all my heart for our blessings. I desire to impress on you daughters of God, you mothers of men, that if this world is to endure, you must keep the faith. If this world is to be happy, you will have to set the pace for that happiness. The adversary of all righteousness and of all happiness has had his innings for a long time in the world. He has betrayed many of the daughters of God into bad habits, and the result will be that their children will suffer from bad habits. If we are to maintain our physical strength and mental power and spiritual joy, it will have to be on the Lord's terms, and he has told us what those terms are. My dear sisters, remember what a power you have with these boys and girls who are growing up. You may have lovely homes and you may have a lot of lovely possessions, but the most desirable thing you have will be the companionship of the sons and daughters of God, in many cases, your own. What a blessing the Lord has given to you. We have had a great war and millions of lives have been lost. On the stand here is a copy of the Book of Mormon, the history of the ancestors of the American Indian, sometimes referred to as the American volume of scripture. I find here in this book a tribute to motherhood, such as I have found in no other publication that I have ever read.\nYou remember the story of the two thousand sons of Helaman. When Lehi came to the promised land, because this was the promised land to them, his family divided; part of them served the Lord and part of them did not. Those who did not become the wild red men of the country, called Lamanites. Those who tried to keep the commandments of the Lord did very well for some time, but by and by the warfare between the two groups was such that it looked as if the Lamanites would overrun the country and take all the property of their white brothers, the Nephites. Hundreds of the Lamanites had joined the Church and when they did so, they made a covenant with the Lord that if he would accept them into the Church they would not again take up arms against their fellows.\nAfter a few years the wars became so serious it looked as if the Lamanites might prevail. Then the Lamanites who had joined the Church said, \"Here, we cannot stand by and let you protect us; we are going out to fight for ourselves.\" Then one of the leaders of the Church said, \"You have made a covenant with the Lord (I would like you sisters today to remember that suggestion)?you have made a covenant with the Lord. You cannot\nbetray the Lord or fail to keep your covenants. You cannot go out to fight and we will have to go on protecting you.\" Then they discovered that more than two thousand young men had grown up since that covenant had been made who had never made the covenant that they would not fight. So they were marshalled and sent out to battle. As a result, they, together with the Nephites that were defending that particular part of the country, succeeded in overthrowing the Lamanite army. These boys were referred to by Helaman as his \"sons\" and he called them his \"striplings,\" for they were youngsters. He tells of the battles they fought with such valor and fearlessness that they frightened the men of the enemy and drove them away. In the last terrible battle that was fought, the ground was covered with dead and dying and Helaman hastened to have his boys gathered from among them. When they were brought in and were counted, it was found that every one had been wounded, two hundred had fainted from the loss of blood, but all were alive. Helaman asked how this could be. And then these youths explained to him that their mothers had taught them to believe in God. They trained them in the faith, and had brought them up to know there was a power greater than that of man. When he asked them how they could have such faith, they answered simply, \"We do not doubt our mothers knew it.\" The faith of those mothers had been planted in the hearts of the sons, and there was nothing that could stop them as long as they were doing what they knew God wanted them to do Teach the Children Righteousness\nSo I say to you, my sisters, the wonderful gift God has given you of a home life in civilization and the opportunities and blessings of the gospel in this dispensation, should inspire you as mothers to train your children from infancy so that as they develop and become exposed to the dangers of life, they will believe that you have known what was best for them, and they, too, will be able to say, when they have made a success of life, that it was because they have followed your teachings and your fine example; and when people will ask them how they could do it, they will say of you, \"We did what our mothers wanted us to do, and we knew that they knew best.\" That is your privilege. Teach your daughters modesty and virtue; teach your sons to be faithful and good, wholesome and true; teach all that you come in contact with to keep their bodies sacred as the tabernacles of their spirits. If we can keep that in the hearts of the Latter-day Saints and go on in the future as we have done in the past, all the world will yet praise Zion and her people. And the Relief Society organization that will have functioned all the way in blessing mankind will not only be praised by men and women everywhere, but they will receive their blessing from the Lord. If you do your part, this glorious welcome will await you when life's labors are complete. \"Well done, good and faithful child, you have been faithful in a few things, I will make you ruler over many things; enter into the joy of your Lord.\"\nRiches of Relief Society\nI pray that the prospect of a headquarters of your own may soon be realized, not for a hundred thousand members only, but many more. See to it that you will not only have a hundred thousand women or two hundred thousand women enrolled, but see that every one in this organization will in every way be worthy to be called daughters of the Lord. That is your privilege and you should exercise your influence for righteousness always. If it were not for the influence and virtue of womankind, this world would travel the downward road mighty fast. You must work to save it. The men have never succeeded without your help, and so, set your own homes in order. Honor your fathers and mothers, respect and love your husbands and your children, love one another.\nAfter a while, when the summons shall reach us and we look back upon the experiences of a rich, wellspent life, many of you will be able to say, \"Because of my membership in the organization that God set up through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the organization known as the Relief Society, I have had many riches added to my life that I could never have known in any other way.\"\nI pray that the Lord will bless your Presidency, that they may go forward under his inspiration directing the General Board that works with them, and all these stake presidencies and boards and ward presidencies, and every member. Keep in mind always that these bodies are sacred to our Heavenly Father, and like Daniel of old, when they wanted him to take into his body the (Concluded on page 783) THE MATTHEW COWLEY FAMILY"

Towler President of Wells Stake SIX months before Elder Mathew Cowley left New Zealand, one of the native saints predicted that he would be chosen an apostle. His patriarchal blessing states: ?You shall come an ambassador of Christ to the uttermost bounds of the earth. Page 722 MATTHEW COWLEY 723Your understanding shall be great and your wisdom reach to heaven.\" Elder Cowley is eminently trained and qualified for such an exalted position. He was born of goodly parents and lived the gospel in his youth. In his early manhood he married a beautiful and talented young lady, Elva Taylor, and they have labored together to make the world a better place in which to live. Thirteen years of Elder Cowley's life have been devoted to missionary work in New Zealand. He labored there during both of the world wars. His experiences have taught him one of the great lessons of life, namely, 'There are two sides to every story.\" As a result, he is blessed with a sympathetic understanding, is kind and patient, honest and fair, does not excuse failings in men, but is ever anxious to assist them to overcome their failings. His nature is one of absolute loyalty and he does not like destructive criticism. Because of his genuine humility, he has never sought after any position in the Church. He is altruistic, liberal, and generous. Before leaving New Zealand, he literally gave the coat off his back. A faithful saint admired the topcoat he was wearing, and in a Christ-like spirit, he took it off and gave it to him. Blessed with a sense of wit and humor, coupled with a pleasing personality, has won for him a host of friends. Because of his great work among the Maori people and the thorough understanding he has of them. Elder Cowley is admired and respected by government officials of New Zealand, and has been given important assignments by them. Possibly his greatest achievement is his spiritual and intellectual strength by which he has become a powerful preacher of righteousness. As he travels throughout the Church, he will warm the hearts of the saints and stimulate them to righteous living. The leaders and saints of Wells Stake are appreciative of the life and labors of Elder Cowley at home and abroad. They are firmly convinced that his call came by inspiration and that he will be a tower of strength in the great work of the Lord which lies ahead for him."

General Relief Society Conference October 3 and 4, 1945 A General Relief Society Conference was held on October 3 and 4, 1945, at Salt Lake City, Utah, with President Belle S. Spafford presiding. The following sessions were held: An officers' meeting on Wednesday afternoon, October 3, in the Assembly Hall on Temple Square for general, mission and stake officers; A reception to honor retiring President Amy Brown Lyman and the retired members of her General Board, for stake and mission officers and specially invited guests on Wednesday night, October 3, in the Lafayette Ballroom of the Hotel Utah; Morning and afternoon general sessions for Relief Society workers and the general public on Thursday, October 4, in the Salt Lake Tabernacle at 10 a. M. And 2 p. M. This general Relief Society conference, the first held since October 1941, because of World War II, had a record-breaking attendance. The audience on Thursday afternoon completely filled the Tabernacle. A spirit of enthusiasm pervaded by a spirit of love and unity in Relief Society work was manifest throughout the sessions. A feature of the conference was the launching, with the approval of the First Presidency, of the erection of a central Relief Society building to be erected in Salt Lake City, detailed plans for which will be publicized later. The final session was blessed by the presence of President George Al-Page 724 bert Smith who delivered a moving address for the guidance of the mothers of the Church and all members of Relief Society. A number of other members of the General Church Authorities and members of the General Church Welfare Committee were in attendance at the Thursday sessions as well as specially invited guests. The music for the conference was under the direction of Sister Florence J. Madsen, member of the General Board. A solo 'The Voice in the Wilderness\" was beautifully sung by Aline Peterson; and Lily Priestly, at the organ, rendered lovely selections for the prelude and postlude numbers at the Wednesday afternoon meeting. At the Thursday sessions, under the direction of Sister Madsen, with Brother Alexander Schreiner at the Tabernacle organ, a chorus of Singing Mothers from the sixteen stakes comprising the Salt Lake Region rendered beautiful and inspiring numbers. This same group was asked by the First Presidency to furnish the special music for the first two sessions of the 116th Semiannual General Conference of the Church held the following day, on Friday, October 5. The opening and closing prayers at the three sessions were offered by present and former Relief Society mission presidents. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 725 There were representatives from 146 stakes and 18 missions of the Church. On Monday morning, October 8, in the Relief Society General Board room in the Bishop's Building, a meeting was held by the Relief Society General Presidency and members of the General Board Mission Lesson Committee with the mission Relief Society presidents of 17 missions. The address delivered at the Thursday afternoon session in the Tabernacle by President George Albert Smith is printed in full as the feature article of this issue of the Magazine. Digests of the other talks given at the various sessions follow in the order of their delivery. OFFICERS' MEETING, OCTOBER 3, 1945"

Spafford WE welcome you all and we are grateful for your presence, your safe journey, your devotion to the work that makes you put forth the effort to be here, for the sacrifices of your families. I am sure that our hearts are filled to overflowing today in gratitude to our Heavenly Father for the privilege of this conference. We are deeply grateful for the cessation of hostilities that has made this conference possible. For four long years we have been bowed down by the strains, anxieties, and sorrows of war. Even though we know that many of the sorrows and problems of war are still with us, we acknowledge the goodness of the Lord at this time. Our last general Relief Society conference was held in October 1941, and we were enthusiastically looking forward to the observance of our Relief Society centennial in connection with the coming April conference. Interest and enthusiasm were running high, only to be cut short by war. Relief Society Activities, 1941-1944 At the close of 1941 we had an enrollment of 115,000. Then the advent of the war and the accompanying employment of women, together with the many war interests of women, affected in some measure our enrollment. Under these conditions we feel our membership has held up remarkably well. We have today an enrollment of over 102,000. Average attendance has suffered somewhat more than enrollment. The average attendance for the three-year war period, December 1941 to December 1944, is 30.41 per cent of the enrolled membership. The number of visits to homes by visiting teachers is perhaps the most discouraging of all aspects of our work. Figures show a steady decline through the war years, with 126,900 fewer visits being made last year than in 1941. Thehas given us pronounced concern during the war years. Government restrictions on paper, increased printing and engraving costs, labor problems, both at the printing offices and in our own department, have caused us many troubled hours. Moreover, the Magazine has never seemed of greater importance to us, being the major medium through which the General Board has been able to reach local officers and the"

Recommended courses of study have been followed in most of the missions as well as in the stakes and these have been generally well received by Relief Society members.\nFigures for the past four years on phases of compassionate service which can be tabulated are very interesting. For each of the four years, visits to the sick and homebound did not vary a great deal. During the period, December 1941 to December 1944, an average of 132,000 visits were made annually to the sick and homebound, and an average of 19,000 days' care was given the sick annually by our Relief Society sisters. Services rendered by Relief Society in time of death averaged 600 monthly.\nRelief Society women have wholeheartedly supported the war effort. Extensive service has been given the Red Cross sewing and other programs. Relief Society women have also been active in salvage and food conservation programs. During the past four years tremendous amounts of regular Relief Society sewing have been done; ward conferences and special activities, such as Relief Society socials and anniversary programs, have gone successfully forward. Hundreds of meetings in addition to the regular weekly Relief Society meetings have been held, with encouraging gains being made in the number of ward preparation meetings held.\nChanges in Leadership\nGreat changes have been made in our leadership.

The same day, Belle S. Spafford was sustained as the new General President of Relief Society.\nNew Name for Relief Society\nWe begin the work of this new era with a new name being officially adopted for the Society. By action of the General Board of Relief Society, June 27, 1945, the name of the Society was officially changed from \"National Woman's Relief\nSociety\" to \"Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\"\nRestoration of Union Meetings\nThis is also a day of restoration for Relief Society. Union meetings have been restored to us allowing stake officers to once more function normally. Visits to stakes by General Board members have once more been authorized by the First Presidency.\nWe urge that in the conduct of union meetings every possible effort be made to make them as beneficial to ward workers as possible. Let your preparation for these meetings be thorough and keep in mind the two great purposes of union meetings; namely, to aid wards toward fine performance in all phases of Relief Society work and to assist in developing ward leadership. Stake leaders are cautioned to do nothing that will hinder the ward in standing on its own feet.\nNew Recommendations\nThe General Board recommends that except when a stake counselor is needed in the department over which she has general supervision, or unless she feels a special need to conduct a department for ward counselors, that she attend the department conducted for presidents. Ward counselors should also attend the presidents' department unless a special department is being conducted for them. Secretaries, when not in departments specially planned for them, should also attend the presidents' department. We feel that tion when executive officers have an\nopportunity to meet together in a consideration of Relief Society work.\nThe General Board also recommends that a"

The stake work meeting leader shall be responsible for a department at union meeting to be attended by ward work-meeting leaders. Wards will plan the work-meeting day for themselves as heretofore, but the union meeting department should stimulate, encourage, suggest programs and aid wards in maintaining high standards of work-meeting activities.\nSubmittal of Annual Reports\nStake secretaries are requested to begin immediately to work toward getting annual reports into the General Office on time. Ward reports should reach stake secretaries not later than January 5. Stake secretaries should in turn submit their reports to the General Office not later than January 20. Sisters, we plead with you to see that these dates are met.\nStake officers are advised to remind ward officers that ward Relief Society conference programs should be planned with the purposes of the conference clearly in mind, namely, to report organization activities and accomplishments, to acquaint the ward membership with the program and needs of the Society, and to emphasize the blessings of membership in the organization. The ward conference is the Relief Society meeting from which Relief Society should derive benefits, and, with very few exceptions, it accomplishes its purposes best when presented by Relief Society women. The main goal of the meeting should not be merely to present a brilliant speaker or an entertaining program in order that a large crowd will be in attendance, but rather to present in a fresh, interesting, and appealing way a program that truly represents Relief Society, and that draws a large attendance because it does interestingly represent us. The work of Relief Society is appealing and dramatic in itself, and, if properly presented, is full of interest for ward members. Officers should not feel in making ward conference assignments that it is necessary to go outside the ward or stake for talent. The conference program provides excellent opportunity to use and develop local talent and to recognize capable, faithful Relief Society women. Every ward and stake has an abundance of excellent talent, if leaders will but search it out and make use of it. Support of No-Liquor-Tobacco Committees Suggestions will come from the General Board during the coming year in support of the efforts of the General No-Liquor-Tobacco Committee to abolish the use of alcohol and tobacco. We trust that stakes and wards will give full support to any programs that are released or projects that are initiated either by the Board or your local committees. Emphasis on Four Phases of Work We have been advised by our Church leaders to give renewed emphasis to four phases of our work: First, the ultimate objective of all that we do is to build testimonies of the truth of the restored gospel, and to teach women to apply the saving principles of the gospel in their every-day lives. Second, as Relief Society leaders, we must seek earnestly to spiritualize and strengthen Latter-day Saint homes. Third, we are counseled to take cognizance of our part in the Welfare Program of the Church. Love-inspired welfare service has been a fundamental part of our work since the very beginning of our existence as a Society. Under the impetus of the Church Welfare Plan, bishops are enabled to more fully discharge their part in relation to needy Church members in their wards, and Relief Society sisters, relieved of the necessity of maintaining a charity fund and serving as a source of supply, may more fully devote themselves to phases of the work that are in accord with their natures and ability. A fourth duty to which our attention has been called is that of bringing actively into Relief Society greater numbers of Latter-day Saint women, particularly young women. Every Latter-day Saint woman is entitled to the blessings of membership in this Society. Encouragement of Visiting Teaching We urge that special efforts be put forth to strengthen the visiting teacher program during the coming months. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 729 There is a need for organized effort to develop hopes and attitudes and sentiments, favorable outlook and points of view, the spirit of mutual purpose and co-operation; to implant religious conviction with its sustaining spiritual strength. Today's world offers such excellent opportunity for the intimate human service which our visiting teachers can render. May the Lord bless you to keep alive your sense of values, your sense of proportion, your faith that as you work unselfishly in this great organization, you are genuinely helping the women of this Church, you are helping to advance the work of the Lord."

Simonsen Member Relief Society General Board WHEN the Prophet Joseph Smith organized the Relief Society, he stated that the purpose of the organization was \"to care for the needy, and to save souls.\" Through the wisdom of our leaders, a day has been provided whereby both of these aims may be served. This is the work meeting. This day is comparable in its cultural value to other prescribed courses, and may require more thorough preparation than any of the other courses to make it one of the best departments in the Society. It seems that there are two real objectives for each work meeting-first, to plan a very vital program, and second, to get the women to participate in that program. Sisters, the day is yours. Plan it thoroughly and wisely, and don't be guilty of planning something that will just \"take up the time.\" The greatest strength of the Relief Society lies in the fact that direction and guidance are given it by the priesthood of God. Today, the* leaders have charged us to strengthen the home and to teach our members, especially the younger sisters, homemaking skills. Work meeting is our day of opportunity to fulfill that charge. It must be a day of training for homemaking skills. It is said that a man may build a house, but only a woman can build a home. Are mass production and machine-made articles which lack beauty and individuality taking us far afield, and are we losing not only the ability to create, but also the appreciation of fine workmanship? If so, work meeting is our opportunity to develop again these skills and appreciations. We must use this day to instil in our sisters a love for beauty and an ability to create it. It is an opportunity to encourage the incompetent home-maker to participate! I remember a period in my life when, as a teen-age girl, I was careless in the upkeep of my room. My mother conceived the plan of twice a week cleaning everything from the top of my dresser and putting a fine, clean, white dresser scarf on it. It wasn't very long before I saw to it that the rest of the room was as clean as the dresser scarf. And so it is with the woman who has never learned homemaking skills. Let her participate in beauty in Relief Society work meeting and it will carry over into her home. The woman who says, '1 do not wish to learn\" creates another problem. An effort must be made to find some activity which will especially appeal to her. Getting people to attend work meetings for the first time may call for a personal contact. The most successful work days are those that meet the needs of the women best, whether it be in making a better loaf of bread or sewing a finer seam. The degree of success you achieve depends upon your attitude toward work meeting and upon your prayerful and thoughtful efforts. It has been said: A task without a vision is drudgery, A vision without a task is a dream. But a task with a vision is VICTORY. Relief Society has given us the task; Relief Society has given us the vision. May the Lord bless us with Victory."

History is never a solid mass of achievement; it is a mosaic of countless parts, each one perfected by the sacrificial devotion of some particular person\" (Dr. Waldemar W. Argrow, Sunshine Magazine, July 1945). The history of Relief Society has been determined by the ideals, the plans, and the hopes of those who have gone before us. The program of visiting teaching is based upon an ideal, the ideal of the brotherhood of man, that man is indeed his brother's keeper and that love of man is a virtue all possess. The plan of those who instigated this program was that the sisters of the Church should be concerned with the welfare of the group in which they lived, that those who were sorrowing should be comforted, those who were hungry should be fed, and those who were naked should be clothed. It was not a new plan. One who had lived on earth many years ago had pointed the way, had put the principle to practice in his own life. The Prophet Joseph, in instructing the sisters, called attention to this, saying, \"Said Jesus, ?Ye shall do the work, which ye see me do.'

Sloan, former Relief Society President of Portland Stake; Ethel B. Andrew, former General Board member, now Nampa Stake Relief Society President; Caroline T. Eccles, literature leader, East Mill Creek Stake Board. These Are the grand key-words for the Society to act upon.\" Today we have this mighty sisterhood. We have on the rolls of Relief Society 29,027 visiting teachers who call in the homes of the Church members. It has been a wonderful plan, it is indeed an ideal plan, and, because it is based on an ideal, it must be measured by that ideal. Percentages may measure accurately the number of visits made in homes, but the good those visits accomplish, the heart-warming, soul-stirring good they do can never be read from figures. Yet, sisters, we hear even from stake presidents, \"Are we still going to do visiting teaching? We just can't get women to go. They say they are not wanted in the homes, and anyway there is no need to go now we no longer receive contributions.\" Are there no longer sorrowing people? Are there no longer those who hunger spiritually? Is there no longer a need for human love and interest among our Relief Society sisters? Too few visiting teachers are \"called to the work.\" Rather, they are pleaded with after Relief Society or at any time they happen to be met. \"Oh, Sister Jones, won't you help us out with visiting teaching? We just can't get anyone to go! We know just how hard it is to get away, but if you'll just help us out for a little while....\"Does this give a sister a vision of the opportunity being presented to her? Attitude means everything in the accomplishment of work. No one who does not have within herself a love of Relief Society and of visiting teaching can do this as it should be done. We must love the sisters we visit with the pure love of the gospel. We must desire with all our hearts to serve them. Never has there been a greater opportunity for doing the Master's work than there is in the world today.\nWe have the greatest organization ever put on earth for women, but it is of no avail unless we use it. The\norganization is here, the opportunities for doing good are here. The leadership which determines the use made of that organization and those opportunities is here today. Your attitude, your vision, your understanding and love of the work determine the fulfillment of the ideal enunciated to us. You here today hold in your keeping the future of the visiting teaching program. See that you guard it well.\nTherefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day (Doc. and Cov. 4:2).\nGENERAL SESSION, MORNING OF OCTOBER 4, 1945"

I love the Relief Society and I have reason to because I have served as bishop of three different wards, and I have said that I could get along as well without a first counselor as I could without the Relief Society president. We have been particularly privileged, the present Presiding Bishopric of the Church, to be able to labor as advisers to Sister Robison and her counselors, to Sister Lyman and her counselors, and now to Sister Spafford and her assistants. Recently our work has been divided so that we are only advisers in their temporal affairs and their work in caring for the poor and those in distress. We have learned to love and appreciate these women, and it is a delight to be here this morning, to listen to them, as I know it is to each one of you here present today. This is a wonderful Church! Yesterday we went to the temple, the General Authorities with the mission presidents, in a meeting that commenced at nine o'clock, and we left there at twenty minutes after five. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 743 As I sat listening to the mission presidents bring back to the headquarters of the Church the spirit of the work that is being done under their direction, from the fringe of the Church, where the Church is expanding, I said to myself, \"Well, if the Prophet Joseph had died for the establishment of the missionary system of this Church only, he surely would not have died in vain.\" Then to come here this morning and see this grand group of Relief Society workers, and let our minds go out to what is actually being done in the Church everywhere, I say again that if the Prophet Joseph had died for the establishment of the Relief Society organization of this Church only, he surely would not have died in vain. I want to remind you of one statement of the Master. You will remember how he gathered his followers from their nets and their fishes. After Jesus was crucified, Peter said, \"I go fishing,\" and you remember that others of the disciples followed him, and then how Jesus came and found them when they were not successful in their fishing and he told them to cast their nets on the other side, and you know then the success that followed. And then Jesus said, directing himself to Peter: Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? (These fishes.) He saith unto him. Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him. Feed my lambs. He saith unto him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him. Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him. Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him. Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep (John 21:15-17). TAGW, sisters, I do not know anything in the world that we can do to more pleasingly demonstrate to our Father in heaven our love of him than feeding the sheep and the lambs of his fold. He has said that the good shepherd leaves the ninety and nine to go out after the one strayed away. We, from the Presidency down, are going to try in this Church to emphasize ward teaching as it has never been done before. We feel that we are becoming marvelously organized and equipped and qualified for doing our work within the sacred walls of our beautiful buildings, but there are many, many on every hand who do not gather to receive the word of God, that we must accentuate our effort and emphasize it, to go to the homes and there carry the message and the spirit of this great latter-day work about which you have been speaking this morning. The Relief Society has a program that parallels the great ward teaching program of the Church. You are messengers to the homes. I like that part of the Relief Society work, where it is done in the right spirit and by faithful and efficient women ?and we have thousands and tens of thousands of them in the Church today?who go into the homes of the Latter-day Saints, taking with them the spirit of the gospel, the spirit of Christ, looking after the lost ones and gathering in and helping and encouraging where encouragement is necessary. If the sisters of this great organization will unite in the spirit of the priesthood of the Church to try to awaken within the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, particularly in those who have been inactive and indifferent, a love of the truth, a devotion to God and his great latter-day work, I am sure we will see the work of God going on as it has never done before, and the day will come when we will learn how to do our work for the salvation and exaltation of our Father's children in a far better manner than we have ever done before. God bless each one of you in your various fields, in your wards and stakes, and give you vision and power and inspiration, that you may touch the hearts of your people, that you may arise in your great assignment to heights you have never dreamed of before, to the honor and glory of God and the blessing and the salvation of his children, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. ?Photograph courtesy Salt Lake Tribune. THREE GENERAL PRESIDENTS OF RELIEF SOCIETY President Amy Brown Lyman, 1940-1945; President Belle S. Spafford, 1945?-; President Louise Y.

How privileged we are to be able to assemble and listen to the counsel of the President of our Church. I think we have never appreciated this privilege as we do now because we were not granted the opportunity of gathering in conferences during the war years. We rejoice that this opportunity has been restored to us. Today in this great gathering are Relief Society women from most of the stakes of Zion, and most of the missions of the Church are represented by the presence of Relief Society mission presidents or Relief Society mission presidents who have only recently been released. However, there is a great group of loyal, faithful Relief Society women who have no representation here today, with but one exception, and who, I know, are with us in spirit if not in the flesh. They are our European Relief Society sisters. My sisters, we in the United States have been in constant communication with the Church authorities. Many of us could listen to the conference proceedings over the radio. Also, we were visited quarterly at stake conferences by Church authorities, and at any time we could write in to headquarters and get any counsel and help that was needed. Many of our missions have been handicapped by the lack of missionaries, but they did have mission presidents and Relief Society presidents sent from headquarters to preside over and lead the work there, and were in communication with the Church most of the time. In spite of these handicaps, they accomplished a wonderful work in both war and regular Relief Society activities. Some even started welfare plans and had singular success with these ventures. Today, I wish to pay tribute to our sisters in Europe. These women who have carried on Relief Society work under handicaps that would be discouraging even with missionaries in their midst. Since the fall of 1939, when the European saints sang \"God Be With You Till We Meet Again,\" while waving goodbye to the missionaries on board ships sailing to America, our European brothers and sisters (with the exception of the British who have had good communication with Church headquarters) have had very little direct communication with Church authorities and the leadership was placed in the hands of local brethren. They have suffered tribulation beyond our comprehension. The Church and auxiliaries through Brother Thomas E. McKay, Assistant to the Council of the Twelve, have made every effort to get lessons and communications to these good people. Barring accident to letters and lessons enroute ?Norway and Denmark were reached through Sweden; Germany, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands were reached through Switzerland; and conversely, any word we received reached us by the same route. Occasionally, we would get and send Red Cross messages; but they took six to eight months to get to their destination, and were only a few words long. However, we were thankful for the information received, though scarce, and, now, since the cessation of hostilities, many letters bearing foreign postmarks have arrived and the stories they tell are of great interest to us. So that these sisters may have a part in our conference today, I am going to tell you of some of their activities. Can you imagine our wards with none of the brethren present to conduct the meetings?to administer the sacrament? Quite generally throughout the European mission, and especially in Norway, Germany, and Switzerland, the men belonging to the Church were in service or had gone underground. The Relief Society women were called to hold the people together, to conduct all the meetings. They even had singing practice and in some places the Singing Mothers' groups were very active. The Relief Society visiting teachers were given added responsibility as there were no men to do ward teaching. Where it was possible and there were older men holding the priesthood, they would visit the branches periodically and ad-minster the sacrament. At all other times it was the Relief Society women who carried the full responsibility of keeping the Church membership together. With the beginning of the war the Relief Society plunged into war work along with their regular programs. In Britain, under the direction of Sister Anastasiou who is here with us today, the Relief Society, among other things, gathered clothing for refugee organizations and received a gracious letter of thanks from the council in charge of distributing this clothing. ONE of the most touching incidents to come to us from Europe is the story of Sister Zippro, the Netherlands Relief Society president. She was willing to face alone the dangers of an invading army in order that members of the Church might receive assistance from the Relief Society. After hostilities between the two armies ceased, this dear sister, knowing of the terrible destruction of Rotterdam, concluded to ride her bicycle (the only means of travel because train travel, etc., was thoroughly disrupted) sixty miles from Amsterdam to Rotterdam. She found many of the families living with other members, as they had lost all earthly belongings when their homes had been completely destroyed by bombs. She immediately ascertained their needs and started to raise funds from among the other members to help those most affected by the invasion. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE Her bravery and devotion to the ideals of Relief Society under such trying and perilous circumstances are worthy of our highest praise. Nor did our Relief Society sisters confine their benevolent work to their own missions, but gave generously of their resources to those of another country. The Oslo Branch Relief Society gave a dinner for the; old people of the branch and the food was furnished by the Danish Relief Society, otherwise no festival could have been held as food was almost as scarce in Norway as anywhere in Europe. Both the Swedish and Danish missions obtained food permits at regular intervals and sent food into Norway to be distributed among the Norwegian saints. It is amazing to note that in such a terrible period of our world's history, new Relief Societies were being organized. I want to read an excerpt from a letter to Brother McKay from Elder Fritz Johanssen, the Swedish Mission President: Between August 7 and 22, together with District President Claus A. Person and Sister Astrid Johanssen of the mission Relief Society board, I made a journey to Finland. The little Society was organized at my first visit shortly after the winter war 1939-40 to a regular branch. This time we had the great pleasure of baptizing three persons. This time I was inspired to undertake the Finland journey and at the same time write an additional part of its gospel history as far as Finland is concerned, namely, that the first female Relief Society was organized there. Time and again we felt as when the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith 747 organized the first Relief Society in the world. All of the letters I have read coming from Europe tell of the terrific need for clothing. Clothing is, of course, rationed, but even those with money cannot find the necessary items to buy. Our members in Denmark have gone stockingless for a year at a time and shoes are never seen in the shops. As is generally the case, the children are suffering the most. Now permission has been granted to send eleven-pound packages into all the missions except Germany and Czechoslovakia; and I am happy to report that packages are being sent by our Central Welfare Storehouse to the branch and Relief Society presidents for distribution to the needy members, which include nearly all since money is not involved. There just aren't any clothes to buy of either good or bad quality. My dear sisters, what inspired these women to perform these unselfish and thoughtful deeds? It was their membership in Relief Society, their knowledge of the purpose and ideals of Relief Society, that gave them the courage to undertake those difficult tasks. It was the Relief Society organization that empowered those women and made their efforts to gather funds and clothing and to send food to members in another country effective. Without this organization, they could not have been prepared to take over the responsibility of handling the work of the branches when they were left with no priesthood to officiate. Their letters thank us for our prayers in their behalf.Let us give thanks for these faithful sisters and brothers for their trials have indeed been greater than ours. In closing, I wish to bear my testimony. I am thankful for the gospel, for the meaning it gives to my life. I am thankful for the opportunity of serving the Lord and I feel to express with Moroni of old: And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled (Moroni 10:31),"

            "content": "Dream for a Relief Society Building Counselor Marianne C. Sharp T WOULD ask an interest in your faith and prayers for I feel that words are very inadequate to express the feelings which are in my heart today. I am grateful for the privilege we have as sisters?as mothers always working for the salvation of our children and as Church members striving for the furtherance of the work of the Church?to meet together once more in a Relief Society general conference. I am grateful, personally, for the opportunity I have to work in the Relief Society under Sister Spafford who is true and faithful, and I want to thank my Heavenly Father for this privilege. I love the Relief Society. I love the sisters in the Relief Society and have joy in association with them. Wherever I have lived or visited in the Church I have felt the close bond of love and service which links together the members of the Society today. The members today, however, are only links in a great chain of sisters which reaches back to include the valiant and great women of the past 103 years, and will stretch forward to encompass those yet unborn who will devote their services to working for the good of others, always seeking at the same time to improve themselves. I am thinking particularly this afternoon of those sisters who have gone on before. Ever since Sister Lyman appointed Sister Spafford and me to help prepare the book A Centenary oi Relief Society to commemorate the hundredth birthday of the Society, I have felt very near to the Relief Society leaders of the past and the faithful members who are the mothers, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers, even great-great-grandmothers, of the members today. They have stepped out alive for me from the pages of the Woman's Exponent and from the minutes of the General Board. Their testimonies have increased my testimony. I have shared in their joys and sorrows and, as nearly as one can, I have entered into their desires for the upbuilding of Relief Society. As we studied this history of the past, we read of one great dream which had gone unfulfilled. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 749 It is of this unfulfilled dream I wish to speak today. In order to introduce it, I will take you back forty-nine years ago yesterday to October 3, 1896, to a general Relief Society conference held in the Assembly Hall. Aunt Zina Young was the president of the Relief Society at that time and with her on the stand sat her three counselors, her vice-presidents as they were called, First Counselor Jane S. Richards, Second Counselor Bathsheba W. Smith, and\" her third Counselor Sarah M. Kimball. It was near the end of the afternoon session that, according to the minutes taken by Sister Emmeline B. Wells, then secretary: President Zina D. H. Young, in her remarks, opened out upon the subject of a house for the Relief Society, to be owned by them. Women had done so much to help build other public buildings and temples that they had no means to build one for the Relief Society. President C. O. Card had said when they lacked the means to go on with the Logan Temple and the men were to be discharged because there was no means to pay them for their work, Sister Jane S. Richards raised five hundred dollars in the Relief Society of Weber County to keep the men working, and that stands as a memento to the sisters forever. Vice President Sarah M. Kimball confined her remarks to the subject of a house for the Society. She felt it a humiliation to be without a place of our own; we had contributed to all public places and at all times. Now we want to have a house and we want land to build it on and it should be in the shadow of the temple. It should be a place to receive strangers in when they come, a place where letters can be written\" from and information given, I think we should vote on this matter, whether you representative women want this building or not; we want to put it to vote. Sister Kimball told the sisters what Joseph Smith had said in Nauvoo to the sisters of the Society there and had given them a lot belonging to the Church and a house on it which could be repaired and made useful. Now, said Sister Kimball, I want to ask you sisters if you want such a building as I have described. The motion was put and the vote was unanimous. Sister Kimball added, if you want this proposition carried out, then see how much can be done. The interest in building a house for the Relief Society continued strong and money began to be collected, however through the next ten years there also ran the fear, expressed quite often by those dear, faithful sisters as once stated by Sister M. Isabella Home?\"don't branch out too largely at once, there is not much to do with, and the Relief Society must care for the poor.? In view of this great financial responsibility which they felt was theirs, the money was not quickly forthcoming, but the dreaming and planning went on. Their plans called for kitchens, pantries, banqueting hall, cooking utensils, a furnace and closets and a room for the janitor, and offices upstairs, \"with library and bureau of information, that will be in the best sense educational, and be open to all members of the society, and where lectures may be given by distinguished professors in all branches of science, art and literature, and on general topics.\" In 1900, the Young Ladies Mutual Improvement Association and the Primary Association joined forces with the Relief Society with the hope that together the three could raise enough money for a suitable woman's building. March 1901, The matter was presented to President Lorenzo Snow who, in was reported to have said: The women must have twenty thousand dollars before commencing the house; in fact, before we could put a spade in the ground or have the land measured off, and when we had that amount on hand he would give the deed of the land, and we could be as sure of it as you will of happiness when you get to heaven. In speaking to the Relief Society at an outing at Saltair, July 9, 1901, President Snow said in part: You who are present today are members of the oldest organization in the Church outside of the Priesthood. The Relief Society was organized nearly"

            "content": "sixty years ago, with 18 members (my sister, Eliza R. Snow being the secretary) by the Prophet Joseph Smith, under the inspiration of the Lord; and from that day to the present it has gone on without interruption growing in strength and usefulness, until today it is recognized as one of the most powerful forces for good in the Church. You are now 30,000 strong I am told, with a building fund of nearly $5,000, and with upwards of $100,000 worth of property in your possession. In addition to this you are the only ones among the Saints who are doing anything in a financial way against a day of famine. Your work in this direction is most commendable, and I hear as a result that you have 103,783 bushels of grain, together with an amount of flour and beans, safely stored against a time of need, as well as $3,331 to expend for the same purpose. In a letter of July 1901 signed by the First Presidency, Lorenzo Snow and Joseph F. Smith, it stated: We commend the undertaking [of a woman's building] and have contributed a valuable building site opposite the Temple, valued at $18,000. Sister Zina D. H. Young, President of the Relief Society, died in August 1901, and, in October 1901, President Lorenzo Snow passed away. The new president of the Church, President Joseph F. Smith, called Bathsheba W. Smith to be the new Relief Society president, and the plans continued to progress under her administration. The site which has been described on which a three-story building of yellow pressed brick with a stone foundation was to be built for a woman's building became the Bishop's Building?Relief Society donated $8500 toward its erection and was given quarters in it. The first Relief Society General Board meeting was held in it December 3,1909. This, in brief, is the story of the dream for a Relief Society building which was never built. It is a story of heartache for the Relief Society women who had planned and worked for it for so many years. Relief Society today, however, has already outgrown the space that would have been given it in the proposed woman's building. What seemed a tragedy may prove a blessing and joy to Relief Society in the future. I am thankful for the Relief Society women of the past. I am thankful for their vision. They were great and noble women, women who had faith in their own cause, who loved Relief Society, but who knew that the welfare of the whole Church was above all their welfare. They humbly accepted the decisions of the Church authorities with faith as being in their best interests. They were obedient. May we in our day be as devoted and as faithful? and in all things may we render as full and as unstinted an obedience to the authorities of the Church as did our sisters of long ago is my prayer."

            "content": "A Relief Society Building to Be Erected President Belle S. Spafford THIS is a glorious day for Relief Society, a day for which we have longed and prayed, knowing full well it could come only when the nations should still the guns of war. We are grateful to our Heavenly Father that the hostilities which have engulfed the earth, spreading destruction and breaking hearts, have ceased. We acknowledge his goodness that so soon after the disruptions of war we are privileged to meet in a general Relief Society conference.\nThis is the first general Relief Society conference to be held since the Society observed its 102th birthday. We are today setting our feet forward on the second century of Relief Society history. As we approach this new era, we do not anticipate any new nor great departmental purposes of the Society as set forth by the Prophet Joseph Smith and reiterated by each of the succeeding presidents of the Church.\nThe past is a force that is alive, and, like all living things, is growing and maturing while preserving a pattern that can be recognized and defined. From the past we inherit not only patterns and standards, but vision, strength, insight, faith and courage. The past has passed on to us, too, as a part of our heritage, its unfulfilled dreams and desires and bids us keep faith with it in regard to these, for these, too, are a constant invitation to advancement and progress.\nSister Sharp has brought to your attention today a deep-seated and sincere desire that has persisted in the hearts and minds of Relief Society women year after year as the century has rolled by?the desire for a Relief Society building, one that would beautifully and adequately represent the women of the Church. This desire, born and nurtured in the past, is today firmly rooted in our hearts. And, entering as we are upon a second century of Relief Society, a strong and growing organization rich in the blessings of the Lord, this seems the right and appropriate time to bring to fruition this dream of the past, to erect a building that shall stand a monument to Latter-day Saint women and a credit to the Church.\nOur Church is the foremost organization in all the world with regard to women. The restored gospel gives to women a position of dignity and respect. It recognizes their spiritual and mental powers and their right to use their inborn talents to the full. Latter-day Saint women have been organized under the priesthood after a pattern of the priesthood and have been provided unlimited opportunities for development. The gospel teaches that women have an appointed place in the plan of salvation and that the Lord loves his daughters as he loves his sons and that the promises, blessings are the same for both. It, therefore, seems entirely fitting that a building should be erected as a symbol to all people of the lofty position accorded faithful daughters of our Heavenly Father in the gospel plan.\nNurtured by a Church recognizing woman's true position, women have, in turn, given full devotion to the Church. This has been true with regard to the building program of the Church. Even before the women were organized as a Society in Nauvoo, they banded together to help feed and clothe the men working on the Kirtland Temple. It was with the desire to aid the work of building the Nauvoo Temple that Sarah M. Kimball, in 1842, invited her neighbors to join with her in forming a \"Ladies' Society.\" When the Prophet Joseph Smith was approached regarding this matter, he invited the women to meet with him and some of the brethren a week later, at which time (March 17, 1842) the women were organized as the \"Female Relief Society of Nauvoo.\"\nLucy Mack, mother of the Prophet, spoke of the importance attached by the women to their activities in behalf of the Nauvoo Temple, as follows:\nThere was but one mainspring to all our thoughts and actions and that was the building of the Lord's house.\nRelief Society women have given of their best according to their circumstances and conditions, toward the building, furnishing, and beautifying of temples erected by the Church.\nNot only have Relief Society women been vitally interested in the building of temples but they have been generous in their donations to stake tabernacles, ward meeting houses, and other Church buildings, generally raising funds for these edifices as well as building funds,\ncooking and serving dinners or conducting bazaars which have taken weeks and months of tedious preparation.\nYet, after more than one hundred years, during which time they have actively participated in the building program of the Church, they stand today with no home of their own.\nThe continuing growth of the Society, with the continuous expansion of the various departments connected by the General Board, also demand that provision soon be made to more adequately house the general offices, the temple-burial clothes, Magazine, welfare and other departments.\nWith the consent of the First Presidency, and with your support, it is our intention to go forward immediately with plans for the building and for financing its erection. It is our desire to have the building belong to the women of the Church and to have every Relief Society woman feel the pride of ownership in it. It is our desire to have the building not only house the general offices and the various departments maintained by the General Board, but to have it be of service to all members of the Society. We expect to include in it comfortable lounge rooms where you may leave your wraps, a well as meet a friend; check rooms where you may leave your bundles; a relic room where choice articles of historic value may be preserved and displayed; an auditorium with well-equipped work and exhibition kitchens where homemaking demonstrations and lectures may be given, as well as other features suitable to a Relief Society building and the work of the Society.\nGENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 753 It is our earnest desire that it shall be built by the many rather than the few. That every person may be given opportunity to contribute to its erection and enjoy the sense of satisfaction and pride that comes from so doing, we believe that every one of our more than 100,000 members will want to make a contribution and thus become in reality a part owner in this Relief Society home and Latter-day Saint women's memorial edifice. We believe that throughout the Church are many men, as well, who will welcome the opportunity to honor a wife or mother by contributing funds, and that many other friends of Relief Society will wish to show their regard for the Society by assisting financially. Through the united support of all, we believe that the necessary finances will be readily and willingly contributed. We realize, however, that to erect the type of building we have in mind is a mammoth undertaking. We know that if we are to realize our ambition the full support of every enrolled member of Relief Society will be necessary. We would like at this time to know your attitude toward the proposed building program. Therefore, just as our sisters of long ago called for a vote on this identical proposition, so today, forty-nine years later, we too are calling for a vote of this great congregation composed of Relief Society women of our day representing most of the stakes and many of the missions of the Church. Your General Board proposes the erection at the earliest possible date of a Relief Society building that shall be monumental and beautiful, to adequately serve the members of the Society not only for today but in the years to come. Will all those in favor of this proposition please show it by the uplifted hand. (The vote was unanimous in the affirmative.) This is a glorious experience, not only to see your uplifted hands but to feel your support. As soon as plans for the building and its financing are perfected and approved they will be released to you. We feel assured of your support. We appreciate your support in all of the work of Relief Society. We are grateful for your righteousness and your spirit of service. We are grateful for the strength of your testimonies. We are grateful for the women of the past, for their vision and understanding of the needs of Latter-day Saint women, and for their great contribution to us and to the future. We are above all things grateful for the gospel. May the Lord bless you and comfort you and may our righteous and worthy ambitions know fulfillment I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. [The address by President George Albert Smith, page 715, was then delivered. ]"

May you speedily start, and may you speedily finish it. If we are perfectly honest with your, and sometimes we are, we would say something like this to President Spafford, \"Success to you in this building,\" and, as the host said to those guests he had in the house as he went into the closet to take out their coats, \"Here's your hat, but what's your hurry?\" Our building over there is crowded. You need a new building and so do we need more elbow room. Success to you! I wish that every building that is financed would be financed as easily as you are going to finance this building; and I hope I have the privilege, and I am sure it won't be denied, to give my pittance in this direction. In closing, inasmuch as President Smith has mentioned the Lamanites, I just want to pay tribute to a Relief Society worker; namely. Sister Flora Hicks, who has had charge, with her husband, of the Lamanites in the Papago Ward, Arizona. She was called down there ten or twelve years ago, and she passed away about eight weeks ago. We had the privilege of standing in that house as those Lamanites came in to pay homage to her. They are supposed to be cold; they are not supposed to be very enthusiastic in their emotions. When those people came in, about three hundred strong, one at a time and in groups, they cried like babies in the loss of that wonderful woman and what she had done for them. And as they put her under the ground, the little Lamanite president of the Relief Society put fifty dollars in the hands of Brother Hicks. They heard that he had had some intention of moving back to Salt Lake City sometime. She said, \"Here is fifty dollars, and men have another fifty dollars. That is for a monument to this good woman. You are not going to move her from this sacred soil?\" God bless her memory. She gave herself to help other persons raise their standards of life. God bless you. Amen."

Wirthlin Second Counselor, Presiding Bishopric THERE is no question but what I should like to talk to you for a you sisters have missed a great moment about a project in which many things in not being able to at you are vitally interested, namely, tend the sessions of the general the wheat storage project which conference during the past four originated in the days of President years, but I should like you to know Brigham Young when he counseled that we have missed you very much, the members of the Relief Society and we are happy that you are back, to store wheat against a day of need. If we were to continue attending In that day of long ago, the sisters general conference without our sis of the Relief Society went out into the fields after the brethren had harvested the crops and literally gleaned what was left, and from that day on until 1919, the sisters of the Relief Society had been accumulating wheat which eventually amounted to thousands of bushels. The Federal Government, in 1919, proposed the purchase of this wheat, and it was sold to the Government for the sum of approximately $400,000. With the approval of the First Presidency, the money was placed in trust in the Presiding Bishop's office with the understanding that this money would be invested in such a way as to insure its safety and return some interest. Over the years the interest has been paid to the Relief Societies of the Church, who in turn have used it for maternity and child welfare work. But about four years ago, the First Presidency deemed it advisable to invest the money again in wheat to the end that should there come a day of need, some provision would be made to provide for the members of the Church. Hence, a large elevator was erected on Welfare Square with welfare labor, which holds approximately 250,000 bushels of wheat. A small elevator was purchased at Levan, Utah, and another one at McCammon, Idaho. The recently purchased flour mill at Kaysville has an additional storage capacity of 72,000 bushels. At the present time the Relief Society has stored in the Salt Lake Elevator and the one at Levan approximately 215,000 bushels of wheat which has a value at the present market price of over $200,000, and there is a sizable amount of the original wheat funds that has not yet been invested in wheat.\nAs we contemplate this achievement by the women of the Church, the effort required, it represents to\nall of us a grand and glorious achievement. More than that, it represents the principle of generosity and willingness to provide the staff of life for any members of the Church who might be in need. It is further evidence of the divine power that inspires men and women to do those things which are for the spiritual and temporal benefit of the Church.\nAND now as you approach a new project in the way of a building for the women of the Church, there will be no question about your success and the final accomplishment of your objective. No doubt when this building project gets underway, the brethren of the Church will be given the privilege to contribute to the fund that will cover the cost of the building as an expression of appreciation and gratitude for the splendid service rendered by this great organization of women.\nMy mother was a Relief Society president. I say, \"God bless her for her devoted service,\" for out of the service rendered in this great organization, she set her children an example which instilled in their hearts a love for the gospel of Jesus Christ. When I think of these ministering angels of the Relief Society, the words of the song just rendered express best the spirit in which they labor: \"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you, not as the world gives, give I unto you.\" The spirit of the Master motivates this great organization of our sisters to render a service which causes all of us to say, \"God bless them.\"\nMay God bless you in all of your endeavors, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent December 1, and December 15, 1885 \"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations\" ADVICE TO MOTHERS: Mothers, and those who have the care of young children and infants, should remember to be in school themselves every day of their lives, for even the infant imbibes the spirit of her who attends it day by day and hour by hour; delicacy and refinement should guard every action, for, be assured, the plastic soul will bear the impress given! Language, also, should ever be guarded, that no words or exclamations may fall upon the infant ear, but that which is sweet, harmonious, and loving.... You, young mothers, remember day by day and hour by hour the mighty responsibility that rests upon you.... Devote, at least, the next twenty years to maturing and educating your children; this will be to you the finest school on earth.?Hannah T. King. CHRISTMAS: Christmas approaches, and as the merry season draws near, our thoughts revert to a period... When the Eternal Son of God, the mighty Savior of the world, condescended to become the babe of Bethlehem, and descend below all things, that He might bring about the great scheme of redemption, and open up the way whereby a fallen world could be restored to the presence of the Father... He came unto his own, and his own received him not.... Then, when another Christmas day dawns upon the earth, let us remember the Holy One who has again restored the Gospel to the earth... Let us as Latter-day Saints, seek after the spirit of Him whose birth we celebrate, and strive to do the works that He did.... In this way we shall ourselves receive a blessing, and give to all a happy Christmas.? Phebe C. Young. WINTER: Winter at last is here in pomp and magnificence; it has ushered itself in. The beautiful carpet of grass has been replaced by one of pure white snow.... Who does not love, as in the evening they are seated before a cosy fire, to hear the wild winds of winter first coming like a low, moaning whisper, then louder, shriller, and more fierce.... Again, who does not love to view the trees on a clear frosty morning; they stand forth draped in their pure white robes of snow.... All, all in loveliness.... I thank God that I have been given an appreciative mind to enjoy all this loveliness of nature.?Ida. A CHRISTMAS PRAYER Enlighten, comfort, sanctify my heart, Sweeten my temper and subdue my will. I want to bring my sisters to thy throne, I want to love and honor Christ alone, I want to feel the spirit's inward power. And stand prepared for death's important hour.  I want to do whatever God requires, I want a heart to burn with pure desires. Lead me through life to glorify thy grace, And after death to see Thee face to face. -M. A. Greenhalgh Page 756"

            "content": "116th Semi-annual Church Conference  COLORFUL and impressive was the scene in Salt Lake City on the morning of October 5, 1945, the opening day of the 116th semi-annual conference of the Church. All roads appeared to lead to Temple Square as thousands of Latter-day Saints, conference bound, hearts rejoicing in the blessing of our Heavenly Father, eagerly anticipated words which would soon come from inspired Church leaders to guide, comfort, and sustain them. Four weary, anxious war years had passed since the general Church membership had met in the great Tabernacle in conference session, years in which souls had been tried and many had been called upon to mourn. The resumption of conference for the general Church membership, made possible through the cessation of hostilities, was indeed a comfort to the souls of Latter-day Saints, and a joy to their hearts. This conference, too, was an eventful occasion for a most important and impressive ceremony, one participated in by the priesthood and general membership but rarely a ceremony referred to in Church history as a Priesthood Solemn Assembly. Page 758 This ceremony is the custom when voting for a new president of the Church for the first time in general conference, and has been the practice of the Church since President John Taylor was sustained in conference general conference. Voting is by quorums, in order, beginning with the First Presidency and continuing down through the Aaronic Priesthood. Voting by the priesthood is followed by that of the remaining Church membership. In voting, the right hand is raised to the square to witness to the Lord that one sustains the officer for whom he is voting. The Solemn Assembly, presided over by President George Albert Smith and directed by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. At the opening session of the conference October 5, voted to sustain President George Albert Smith as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Smith came to this position on May 21, 1945, following the death of President Heber J. Grant. The humility of soul, accompanied by the power that comes with a deep and abiding testimony of the gospel, confirmed in the minds of the thousands who heard the voice of President Smith as he addressed the Church membership following the voting, the belief that they had indeed sustained one who was a prophet, seer, and revelator divinely appointed and endowed with divine authority to lead the Church in this great and perilous day. The Church membership also EDITORIAL 759 sustained President George F. Richards as president of the Council of the Twelve, and Elder Matthew Cowley as a new member of the Council of the Twelve. Strong and effective, and a terse reminder to the saints of the covenants they had made that day in voting were the words of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. When he said: Today I have given witness to President Smith, to you and to the Lord that I will sustain him as prophet, seer and revelator and president of the Church. Each of us has made a life covenant. God gives to each of us the strength and the power to be loyal; to give up fault finding; to follow the command of the Lord; to follow those whom we have ourselves sustained. Without leadership the Church cannot grow. Throughout all of the sessions of the conference, speakers paid high tribute to President Smith. With unusual clarity and conviction they bore testimony, expounded the doctrines and interpreted the principles of the gospel, and bade Church members to keep the commandments of the Lord. Pronounced emphasis was given the missionary program of the Church and the intention to expand it in the immediate future?to call many men and women into missionary service, was made clear. The music of the conference seemed unusually beautiful. Relief Society was proud that a combined chorus of Relief Society Singing Mothers from the stakes of the Salt Lake Region provided the music for the first two sessions. The desires of the thousands of Latter-day Saints who had so eagerly awaited this conference for the guidance and spiritual succor it might bring them were fully realized. This 116th semi-annual conference will go down in Church history as a great and blessed occasion. BSS."

            "content": "Christmas in the Bible WHAT shall we do on Christmas Eve? What shall we do when the fire blazes high upon the hearth and candles flame in the window? Beyond that window, in the darkness, stars line the black arch of night. Perhaps, far away or near at hand, in the hills, modern shepherds watch their flocks by night. And here we are at home on Christmas Eve thinking about these things. There is no better way to enjoy this evening than to spend it reading the story of Christmas as it is written in the beautiful words of the Bible. Let these words be read aloud and pondered again, for there is need of their serenity and comfort?a great need for their steadfast message of hope: Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him (Matthew 2:1-2). These are the words of St. Matthew, telling the wonderful story of the first Christmas. And the wise men, near the end of their journey, when they had conferred with Herod in Jerusalem, \"departed: and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.\" The story continues, and we can almost see the starlight upon the hill road to Bethlehem, the tall camels silhouetted against the night, the city walls lighted with splendor. It is Luke who gives the exquisite description of the shepherds: And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night (Luke 2:8). Above the desert and the Dead Sea, above the desolate wilderness, safe in the coves of the hills, these shepherds watched their flocks, careful that no lamb wandered into the ravines, careful that no ewe escaped from the walls of the fold. Peaceful were the shepherds and the sheep upon the dark hills. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them. Fear not: for, behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord (Luke 2:9-11). A message for all the world. Christmas as the Bible tells the story! There is no substitute for these words. Nothing can take their place. Before the waning of this Christmas Eve, read this message of the four gospels. The Christmas spirit will come to you across the gulf of time, across the interval of centuries, and there will be no boundaries of time or space. Christmas will be yours! V. P. C. And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER VII SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, trying to find a way to lessen the stigma when her friends will learn that she has been jilted by Hugh Temple, finds that Alec Windsor, a marine on furlough in the town, is attracted to her. She believes that she can make the people in the town think that she has been the one to break off her engagement with Hugh if she pretends to be in love with Alec, Jeff Holden, father of two motherless children, tells Delsa that he loves her, but Delsa thinks that Jeff is merely lonely for his dead wife. ON Saturday morning Delsa rose early to help her mother do the weekly wash. Sometimes, as this morning, she wished she could lie in bed, warm and safe and far from all the troubles and duties of the world about her. But the wash must be done, and her mother, strong and well as she was, could not be expected to do it alone while Delsa loafed in bed. At least, Delsa couldn't expect her mother to work while she rested, so she tossed off the covers, dressed quickly in a faded blue gingham, and went downstairs. 'The clothes will dry quickly in this sun and wind,\" her mother said happily. \"We should be all through by ten o'clock.\" \"Oh, if we are, Fm going for a long horseback ride,\" Delsa cried. \"It will be wonderful up the canyon today?buds just bursting, grass so new and green!\" They worked swiftly, talking of the wedding and of Alec Windsor and of all the neighbors, whose affairs seemed so much a part of their own daily lives. Long before ten, Delsa was hanging the clothes?the morning sun slanting against her brown curls, turning them to fine gold; the wind whipping her gingham dress about her slim young body. Shaking the sheets like white wings about her shoulders, Delsa gave them a little tug and laughed aloud for the sheer joy of hanging clean clothes in sunlight and wind. \"That does it!\" She was startled at the exclamation and turned, to see Alec Windsor on his knee at one side of her, a kodak tipped at a rakish angle, as he swiftly recorded the picture before him. \"Oh, Alec!\" Delsa cried, flushing, \"I look a sight! Why don't you wait?\" \"A sight to be remembered?a sight to be recorded in koda chrome!\" Alec laughed, getting up from the soft ground and coming close to her. \"That was a beautiful picture, Delsa. I think, if you'll give me permission, I'll enter it in some nation-wide contest. Pick up a little money, and make the world happier at the same time.\" \"Better sell it for advertising,\" Delsa mocked. \"Use Sunny Monday soap chips!\" \"It'd make me a fortune,\" he said seriously. Page  He picked up the wicker clothes basket and carried it to the house for her. \"What you going to do once the washing's all hung?\" he asked. \"Oh?nothing much, I guess,? Delsa answered. Her mother heard the question and said, \"I thought you were going for a horseback ride, Delsa. Maybe Alec would like to ride, too. Do you ride, Alec?\" \"I?ll say,\" he laughed, \"have you an extra horse?\" \"There's Hugh's horse in the barn,\" Mrs. Marriott went on happily, thinking she was doing Delsa and Alec and Hugh, too, a good turn. DELSA was a little annoyed. She'd planned to ride up to her's and Hugh's \"thinking spot\"?a big flat boulder that stuck out from the face of the hill east of the ranch, where the two had often sat and pondered on life and death and the weighty problems of youngsters and adolescents. She had wanted to be alone this morning, to think, to plan, to decide. But now she would be with Alec?maybe it would be even more pleasant. She smiled up at him. \"Why don't you come with me, Alec? I can show you the whole valley from the hillside up there,\" and she motioned toward the east. \"I can put up a few sandwiches and some cake and a thermos of milk,\" Mrs. Marriott went on eagerly. \"It's warm enough for a picnic. You'd like that, wouldn't you. Alec? Most boys love picnics.\" So an hour later, Delsa on her little blue mare and Alec on Hugh's roan were climbing up through the pale green brush toward the boulder that would give them a view of the valley. When they reached the spot, Delsa dismounted and let Blue Star's reins trail. Alec swung down from Beauty's back, and came and stood beside her. The mid-day sun was warm, and Delsa took off her bandanna and let her hair blow free. \"Isn't the valley lovely?\" she asked. \"I don't believe there's a more beautiful place in the whole wide world.\" Alec looked out over the scene spread below him. The valley stretched from north to south, like a long tortoise-shell cat stretched on a rock, sunning itself. The plowed farms were the dark spots on her fur; the wheat stubble the lighter blotches. Back of the sunning valley rose another chain of hills, golden in the spring sun. \"Tt is lovely,\" Alec breathed. Delsa sat down on the boulder, and was grateful for the warmth that the sun had given it and for the peace of the position high above the world. \"This is my favorite spot,\" she said dreamily. Alec sat down beside her, very' close. \"You come here often, I guess,\" he said. \"Whenever I can't stand the valley?but that isn't often,\" she murmured. \"Can't stand the valley?\" he asked, inviting her confidence. \"Oh, you know how it is, where you know everyone and everyone knows you. Sometimes you feel that they are too close, too interested. You want to get away.\" \"Why didn't you get a teaching AND FOR ETERNITY 763 position some other place, then?\" The question was gentle. 'If it hadn't been for the war, I probably would have done so,\" Del-sa said musingly. \"But as it was? well, you see so many parents losing their children because they have to, you don't feel like bringing that loss upon your own when it isn't necessary.\" \"You're sweet, Delsa,\" Alec whispered. He picked up her hand, where it lay open beside her, and gently turned it over. The slender golden band that was Hugh's pledge to her, gleamed upon her slim brown finger; the tiny diamond glistening in the sun. Alec touched it, questioningly. \"Does this mean so much to you, Delsa, that you cannot forget it for a moment?\" DELSA looked down at the ring and slowly shook her head. \"It is the symbol of a pledge,\" she said softly. Alec's voice became urgent. \"If you need a symbol,\" he began, \"the pledge must not be real to you-\" \"But I have the symbol,\" she pointed out quietly. \"If I slipped it from your finger-let it roll down there among the rocks and brush below us?what of the pledge then? Delsa lifted her eyes to his and the question he had asked was repeated in the clear blue irises. Then she shook her head wonderingly. \"Would it be as easy as that?\" she asked softly. \"Delsa!\" Alec cried, \"Delsa! You don't love him!\" \"Oh, I do! I do! I've loved him all my life long, Alec. I'll love him as long as I have life.\" \"IT love you like that, Delsa,\" Alec whispered, \"and I've known you only for days. Delsa, darling, I want to marry you. I want to have a little happiness ?I want something to cling to?Who knows whether your Hugh will ever come back? Who knows whether I will ever come back? You deserve happiness, Delsa. We could find it together.\" \"Hugh must come back, some day,\" Delsa said, and her throat ached, knowing that when he came he would bring his wife with him, \"and so must you. Alec,\" she added softly. \"I'd want to, more than ever, if I had you to come back to.\" \"Alec, Alec! You are pledged, too!\" Alec's mouth grew hard and bitter. \"Yes, I'm pledged. But when can I keep that pledge? I didn't ask Helen to marry me, just so that 1 could have the pleasure of being engaged. I wanted to be married. I hurried home to marry her. But she was gone. I may never see her again.\" Delsa shook her head sadly. What could she answer? She knew how he felt ?young and eager and lonely. He wanted arms about him; he wanted love. She felt strangely older than this boy beside her. She understood so well that he was crying, not to her as a sweetheart, so much as to her as a woman?a woman who could take his mother's place, and, holding him in her arms, comfort his loneliness, wipe away his fears. \"I'd return to you, Delsa. I'd love you all my life long,\" he pleaded. \"And after that?\" she asked. \"After that?\" he shrugged, \"Well, we take our chances.\" Delsa shook her head. \"Not with us. Alec,\" she said. He looked at her, the urgency still bright in his eyes. \"What do you mean?\" \"If you married me, Alec, it would have to be as we marry in our Church, for time and for eternity. Would you want me for eternity, Alec, if Helen were there, too, not separated by distance and time as she is here?\" ALEC'S arms went about her and drew her close and his importunate lips were pressed upon her mouth. When she drew back, he said, \"You love me, Delsa, I can feel it. Let's not worry about tomorrow, or the hereafter, or anything else. Let's take what we can take?we'll have that much, anyway, and nothing?neither time nor eternity?can rob us of it once it is ours.\" But Delsa's yielding, sympathetic mood had passed, and she withdrew from his arms, rising lithely. \"We came for a picnic. Alec,\" she said, \"Let's see what Mom put in our lunch?\" She went over to Blue Star and took the canvas bag from the saddle. Alec sat moodily staring out over the valley while she laid a cloth and placed sandwiches and cake and the thermos of milk before him. He looked like an unhappy small boy, and she could not refrain from stooping as she passed him, and laying a light kiss upon his frowning brow. He looked up then, and a smile as bright as sunshine chased the dark look from his eyes. \"Right!\" he cried, and set to work on the lunch. Delsa laughed with him and talked lightly as they ate and later as they rode down the trail together. But she was not happy. The little dialogue there on the boulder, high above the valley, had showed her many things. What these were she couldn't tell just yet ? she would have to be alone, she would have to take out the thoughts that were so jumbled now, smooth them out, and examine them, and find out just what they meant. She didn't get an opportunity to do this until she went to her room that night. There, kneeling in her accustomed place by the window, so that she could look out and see Hugh's old window gleaming in the moonlight, she tried to think. She took Hugh's ring from her finger and looked at it. Was it true that she needed a symbol of her pledge to Hugh and his pledge to her? Was it easier for Hugh to break that pledge because he had no ring to remind him? If that was true, then the thing she had been telling herself all along was not true?that their engagement was binding as a marriage vow, that Hugh had no more right to break it than he would have to violate his marriage pledge. \"Yes,\" she whispered at last, \"I have been wrong. If we had married, Hugh and I, it would have been a sacred rite, in God's temple?a vow taken before him, and never to be broken. Our promises to each other were not the same?they required this ring, this shining diamond to remind me of them. Hugh, Hugh, AND FOR ETERNITY 765 forgive me! I know in my heart that if you had taken those other vows, you would have been true to them. It was my fault, perhaps, for not marrying you before you left. Or maybe it was so intended. But however it came to be, you were free to change, Hugh. You had that right. And you acted honorably in writing to me as you did. Oh, Hugh, I see now that I can write to you at last and release you from your promise to me.\" She laid her forehead against the window sill and held Hugh's ring in her hand, watching it, while the sense of being wronged and cheated slowly dissolved in her heart. I still love Hugh, she thought wonderingly, I think I love him even more than I did before. I love him so much that I want him to be happy?I don't want him to feel lost and afraid as Alec feels right now. And if that Australian girl can comfort him?if her real arms mean more to him than the memory of mine? then I want him to have them. She shook her head slowly. I hope she loves you, Hugh, truly loves you. I hope she isn't marrying you because she feels the compassion for you that I felt for Alec today-She stopped on that thought, \"compassion\"; then she repeated it softly, \"compassion. Is that all I feel for Alec? Is that all that his need awakens in me? Compassion? Could that sustain us through time ? and through eternity?\" She sat there a long time after that, looking out into the night, not even thinking. But at last she rose and went slowly across the room to her dressing table. She carefully put Hugh's ring in a small box and put this in the top drawer, and shut the drawer slowly, surely. Then she went to her bed, and the smooth white pillow was not cooler nor more quiet than her own cheek against it. (To he continued)"

Strong inflationary pressures are still with us and will be until the supply of goods can catch up with the demand. Experience has taught us that the greatest danger lies ahead. The cost of living continued to rise after World War I, reaching its highest point during the months immediately following the armistice. Help is needed in preventing a recurrence of this experience. Returning servicemen and war workers seeking new jobs, as well as all other citizens, should be protected from inflation and the economic depression which inevitably follows.

Wayne Diiggs For Tuesday, March 5, 1946 Objective: To develop the truth that the gospel is ours, but we must strive to carry it to others. IT is paradoxical to learn in life that often the best things we keep by giving them away. In imparting knowledge to others the teacher himself learns. By kind acts to fellow beings one gains in personal kindliness. Love itself is reciprocal. Does not God's gift of his Only Begotten Son forever draw us nearer the Eternal Father? Knowing the strength of this seeming inconsistency, the Lord has always set men's minds upon service to be rendered, rather than personal profits to be gained. \"But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant\" (Matt. 23:11). These were his words to the disciples. With the establishment of his kingdom in the latter days, there has come the same opportunity to serve. Hardly had the Church been organized when the call was given to Parley P. Pratt and his companions to go upon a mission to the Laman-ites (Doc. And Gov. 32). And ever since that October in the year 1830, servants of the Lord in steadily increasing numbers have gone forth to preach the gospel, only to find that they, in turn, have become more converted to the faith. Nor have there been any limits set as to the distances these present-day disciples of the Lord were to carry the message of salvation. As in the days of Peter, so now the passage reads: Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world (Matt. 28:19-20). It is good to have the comfort of the last thought the Lord gave in this injunction. He is always to be with his servants. Missionaries by the hundreds from the year 1830 to the present day have learned,. Through personal experiences, the need for such a priceless companion. The work of the elder or seventy has always been difficult. Page 767  Bitter opposition to the word of God has caused his servants much suffering and misery, even death.\nWhen the first missionaries were sent to England in 1837, the forces of evil which blind the eyes of men were most dramatically made real. Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde and Willard Richards saw legions of devils and felt their physical violence. With hatred toward these brethren for the priesthood they held, and bitterness for the gospel they were to bring to the British people, the fiends of darkness assailed the missionaries. Elder Kimball was knocked senseless to the floor. He recalls the happening in these words:\nI was struck with great force by some invisible power, and fell senseless to the floor. The first thing I recollected was being supported by Elders Hyde and Richards, who were praying for me . . . Elders Hyde and Richards then assisted me to get on the bed . . . when a vision was opened to our minds, and we could distinctly see the evil spirits, who foamed and gnashed their teeth at us. We gazed upon them about an hour and a half (by Willard's watch). We were not looking towards the window, but towards the corner of the room. Elder Richards finally saw the devils coming with their legions, who came towards us like armies rushing to battle. They appeared to be men of full stature, possessing every form and feature of men in the flesh who are angry and desperate; and I shall never forget the vindictive malignity depicted on their countenances as they looked me in the eye; . . . We distinctly heard those spirits talk and express their wrath and hellish designs against us. However, the Lord delivered us from them, and blessed us exceedingly that day (Doc. and Cov. Commentary, page 634; ORSON F. WHITNEY, Life of Heber C. Kimball, page 144).\nThe majority of the missionaries who have gone forth on their good tidings, while not encountering such exceptional experiences with the spirit world, have, nevertheless, seen the flames of hatred for God's work in the eyes of ill-informed men and women. The malice planted in their hearts by the adversary in the case of some nonbelievers has led to overt acts of violence. To be a Mormon missionary at times has meant not to be sure of life itself.\nThere is a love for the truth, however, which makes men brave. One day, they know, every soul must acknowledge Christ. This it is, among other things, that keeps those who have accepted the good word forever trying. The express command from the Lord, too, that his word must be preached puts an obligation upon the Church to have elders abroad in missionary service.\nAs we have followed the history of the saints from Palmyra to Salt Lake Valley, often amid their most dire trials has come the call for men to leave their homes and go abroad to preach the gospel. Through the service of home missionaries within the missions and the stakes of Zion, hundreds of faithful Latter-day Saints, not called up on to devote all their time to preaching the gospel, are also spending many hours seeking out the honest in heart. A steadily increasing number of converts are thus coming into the Church through these laborers. Even the recruiting of the Mormon Battalion in the year 1846 was not without its missionary service. Just so, today, our boys abroad in the armed forces are in the most real sense bearers of the truth. Their lives, when held in line with the teachings of the Church, will add to the glory of the latter-day work. \nLESSON DEPARTMENT 769 Before giving a few excerpts from the journals of early missionaries of the Church, let us look at the names and dates of the major missions opened over the earth, since Elder Heber C. Kimball and his companions first went to the British Isles in 1837. Most of this work*of the gathering of Israel was underway before the turn of the century in 1900. There are two dates before 1837 which should be mentioned again. One is 1830, which marks the first mission of all which was the one to the Lamanites. Oliver Cowdery, Parley P. Pratt, and Ziba Peterson were sent at that time. Six years later. Elder Pratt and others opened the mission to Canada. Orson Hyde went to Palestine in 1841; Noah Rogers and others to the Society Islands in 1844; and Erastus Snow to Scandinavia in 1850. Four other missions were opened in this same year, the French by John Taylor, the Italian by Lorenzo Snow, the Swiss by T. B. H. Stenhouse, and the Hawaiian by George Q. Cannon and companions. The following year three other countries were added to the foregoing fields: South America by Parley P. Pratt; Australia by John Murdock and Charles W. Wandell; and India. In 1853, Elders Jesse Haven, Leonard Smith and William Walker went to South Africa. In 1854 AA Zealand was opened; in 1861 the Netherlands, in 1888 Samoa, and in 1901 President Heber J. Grant opened the Japanese field. The harvest was ripe during the beginning years of the missionary work of the Restored Church. Parley P. Pratt records in his journal the following concerning the number of saints to leave England for Zion: Between the middle of September [1840] and my own embarkation in October, I chartered three vessels for New Orleans and filled them with the migrating Saints viz.: The 'Sidney/ with one hundred and eighty souls; the 'Medford/ with two hundred and fourteen souls; and the 'Henry,' with one hundred and fifty-seven. I next chartered the 'Emerald' on which I placed about two hundred and fifty passengers, including myself and family (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, page 361). Next to England, no field has been more fruitful than the Scandinavian. For a glimpse of the early mission encounters in that vineyard one may well turn to the journal of Andrew Jenson who served for many years as assistant Church historian. He relates this experience on the island of Mors in the province of Jutland, Denmark, under the date of July 1874. Bitter opposition had been encountered by the missionaries there before the incident here given was recorded. It was on a Friday evening that the two missionaries met on the Nykjobing wharf, and instead of putting up in the little city, they struck out in the country at once. Night found them in the village of Jorsby, ten miles to the north, where they found friends who kept them over night. Early the next morning the house, in which they had slept, was approached by a crowd of fishermen hailing from the west coast of Jutland. They had been out on the fjord fishing, but a storm had compelled them to seek shelter for a day or so in the village, which was situated on the east coast of the island. These men were known to be a rough set, and when the owner of the house where the missionaries stopped saw them approaching in their long watertight boots, their short jackets and heads covered with huge fishermen's storm caps, he felt alarmed, fearing that they came for the purpose of ill-treating his guests; and so expressed himself to them, but the young Utah elder told him not to fear, as nobody would get hurt. A loud rap on the door, a response of \"vaer saa god\" (please step in), and in filed a dozen or more strong, weather-beaten sailors, who immediately introduced themselves in their own peculiar way by saying that they had come out of pure curiosity to see the man from Utah, whom they had been informed stopped at the house. \"Then I am perhaps the man you look for,\" said the young elder, as he rose from the table and shook hands with them all. \"I shall be pleased to answer any proper question you may wish to put to me concerning Utah and her people\" (Autobiography of Andrew Jenson, page 75). The distant travels of Elder George Q. Cannon to the Hawaiian people in the year 1850 opened one of the most colorful chapters in the story of missionary endeavor of the Church. It was the Book of Mormon, the greatest of missionary aids, that so often comforted Elder Cannon and his companions just as it has done hundreds of others of the Lord's servants. From his writings entitled \"My First Mission,\" chapters 12 and 16, the following excerpts are taken: Before I commenced holding regular meetings, I had plenty of time for meditation, and to review all the events of my short life, and to think of the beloved home from which I was so far separated. It was then that I found the value of the Book of Mormon. It was a book which I always loved. But I learned there to appreciate it as I had never done before. If I felt inclined to be lonely, to be low spirited, or homesick, I had only to turn to its sacred pages to receive consolation, new strength and a rich out-pouring of the Spirit Scarcely a page that did not contain encouragement for such as I was. The salvation of man was the great theme upon which its writers dwelt, and for this they were willing to undergo every privation and make every sacrifice. What were my petty difficulties compared with those afflictions which they had to endure? If I expected to share the glory for which they contended, I could see that I must labor in the same spirit. If the sons of King Mosiah could relinquish their high estate, and go forth among the degraded Lamanites to labor as they did, should not I labor with patience and devoted zeal for the salvation of these poor red men, heirs of the same promise? Let me recommend this book, therefore, to young and old, if they need comfort and encouragement. Especially can I recommend it to those who are away from home on missions. No man can read it, partake of its spirit and obey its teachings, without bein\" filled with a deep love for the souls of men and a burning zeal to do all in his power to save them.... The conversations, which I had with the natives concerning the Book of Mormon and the origin of the red men, made them anxious to see it. \"It is truly surprising how soon the work of translation began. The first elders landed at Honolulu in December, 1850. Not long afterwards Elder Cannon deeply desiring to know the language had the gift of interpretation given to him. His progress in the new tongue must have been rapid, for in less than two months he was beginning to put the record of the Nephites before some of their descend ants. He writes: 'In the last days of the month of January, 1851, I commenced the work of translation. My fellow laborers, the elders, encouraged me, and from the First Presidency at home ?Presidents Young, Kimball and Richards?came words of cheer, approving of what I was doing, and counseling me to persevere.' \"Naturally this work of translation could be only a part of the missionary work. Preaching, explaining the doctrines, meeting the opposition raised against them by Christian ministers, baptizing, traveling from place to place, administering to the sick, all had their time and place. LESSON DEPARTMENT 771In reference to his work after returning to Wailuku, where he had first found a friendly reception, and from which place he had removed to save his friend, J. H. Napela, from the persecution of the Presbyterian minister, who had so bitterly opposed the work, Elder Cannon writes: ?The preaching of the gospel created great excitement; the people came by hundreds to hear the testimony, and I had the satisfaction of seeing the missionary who had treated me so badly and who had so bitterly opposed and lied about the work, almost deserted by his congregation; they having left his church to hear us preach and see us baptize.... We baptized a large number of people at Wailuku and the adjacent towns, erected a large meeting-house at that place and smaller ones at the other villages, and organized large and flourishing branches of the Church!' \" (Joseph J. Cannon, \"George A. Cannon,\" Instructor, October '44, pages 456-458). Though the darkening shadow of war robbed the world of nearly all but home missionaries, yet the day will come again when the elders of Israel will resume their efforts to carry the gospel to the nations of the world. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must \"give heed unto his word.\" 1. Discuss the work of the seventies in relation to the missionary program of the Church (See Doc. And Cov. 107:25). 2. Have class members who are familiar with missionary work conducted at centers such as Temple Square, Hill Cumorah, etc., tell what they know of this work. 3. It has been said that once a person is a Mormon he is always a Mormon. Though this is not entirely true, there is enough basis for fact in it to cause one to ask?Why.\" Discuss this question. 4. As a people we are ever ready to explain our faith to others. Why? Read the word of the Lord to three of the early members of the Church and note the one charge he gave to all of them (Doc. And Cov. 4; 6:1-9; 11). 5. Read Doc. And Cov. 46:1-7. Note the attitude of the Lord toward him who is seeking the way of life. 6. Have class members who have filled missions, including home missions, relate interesting missionary experiences. For home study suggest the reading of the missionary experiences of Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, and Jacob Hamblin. (See Three Mormon Classics, compiled by Preston Nibley, available at"

The published missionary experiences of other Church leaders will be equally appropriate for home study. Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 6~Charity Rejoiceth in the Truth Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, March 5, 1946 Objective: To show that one who is truly charitable rejoiceth in the truth. We do not always rejoice in the truth?in a knowledge of things as they were, and as they shall be. Sometimes the truth is embarrassing, if not humiliating to us. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 We are reluctant to admit our  mistakes of the past; to acknowledge our circumstances in the present; or to foresee clearly the consequences of our present behavior in the future. \"All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes\" says one of the proverbs of the Bible. Love of self encourages us to protect ourselves with repeated coatings of self-justification. If a neighbor casts a reflection on us or on the behavior of our children, we are inclined to pass judgment on the neighbor by thinking of his ill-rendered deeds or those of his children rather than to weigh, in the light of truth, the reflection cast on us by the neighbor. Even in our efforts to improve people, we must begin by accepting them for what they are. A weary mother frequently rebels against the unceasing, and often destructive and mischievous behavior of her children. When she does, she is but heaping coals upon the fire. Her opportunity to influence her children is to realize the truth that they were born to function; that activity is the normal characteristic of personality; and that her only course is to guide their activity into wholesome and creative channels. Three positive attitudes are open to us toward the truth, (i) We can know the truth. This is an important and necessary step in any satisfactory relationship with it. Yet, this is not enough, for we may know the truth but ignore or even oppose it. (2) We can act in conformity with truth. (3) We can love the truth and rejoice in it. This is the highest relation man can have to truth. To live in harmony with the principles of the gospel, not from intellectual assent nor from obedience alone, but from love, is to rejoice in the truth. Charity?which \"vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, seeketh not her own\"?is free to rejoice in the truth. And only he who has the charity that \"rejoiceth in the truth\" is truly free. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 6?Bible Influence as Revealed in Our Fiction * Dr. Howard R. Drigg's For Tuesday, March 19, 1946 NOVELS came not many years after the invention of the printing press. Prior to the development of this means of spreading literature far and wide, folk were limited to myths, fairy stories, legends, told orally about the firesides. LESSON DEPARTMENT 773 Sometimes these, woven together  \nround a hero, would become a national epic, to be passed on, usually in verse form, down the years. Printing expanded the opportunity for the creation and distribution of not only verse but of fictional stories in prose.\nWith the drama banned by the Puritans in Cromwell's day, a natural demand had come for some substitute of dramatic cast. Fiction was the answer. It is closely allied to the drama. Indeed, many of our best plays are based on good novels. Any well-written story may be changed to a drama mainly by just eliminating the descriptive parts and by using scenery and costume, with a few stage directions, in their stead. The dialogue is, of course, given by the characters in the play.\nAll that might be said as to the qualities that mark an effective drama, applies with equal force to the novel. If it is to grip and hold the reader, it must have action centered in a well-defined plot, and characters of impelling, individual interest. If the story is to live and last for good, it must leave a wholesome effect in the mind and heart of the reader.\nPractically all our best novels reveal, directly or indirectly, the influence of the Bible. This is particularly true of those that have won and held folk of varied classes through the years. Outwardly, this influence is shown in allusions, in lines of scripture, and in themes taken directly from Holy Writ. Inwardly, it is revealed by characters with admirable qualities and by the general tone and uplift of the story.\nSpiritual growth in characters that\ntrayed. In Robinson Crusoe*, sometimes called the first of our novels, Defoe has the shipwrecked hero, alone on an island, tell simply and frankly of his forward steps from a life \"without religious foundation at all\" to one of abiding faith and devotion to God. His conversion began with finding, on the lonely isle, some growing grain like that he had known in his old homeland. Touched by the discovery, Crusoe felt it to be a gift from God. Later, opening the Bible he had saved from the wrecked ship, he found these lines, \"Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.\" Then he began to offer thanks for his food, and pray daily for protection and guidance. The Sabbath he had lost was restored to his calendar; and, finally, when the man Friday came into his life, Robinson Crusoe prayed for wisdom to bring the gospel light into the mind and heart of the poor slave.\nAnother classic novel created in later years, Silas Marner by George Eliot, portrays a similar bringing of a lost soul back into the light. It gives concrete meaning to the Biblical line, \"A little child shall lead them.\" Shocked by the perfidy of a trusted companion, Silas had withdrawn from the world and sunk into bitterness. Then, robbed of his hoard of gold, he was plunged into utter despair, until golden-haired little Eppie came strangely into his home and heart. Gradually the little child led him back to a richer, more religious life.\n*Studied in Relief Society Literature course, 1938-39; See Relief Society Magazine, August 1938, page 501; September 1938, page 634. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 Still another story, which has won and held the hearts of countless folk, is The Tale of Two Cities by Dickens. Its central theme may be found in these precious words of the Savior: \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" Sidney Carton makes this supreme sacrifice to save a friend, to protect the happiness of those he loves. And as he goes nobly to his death at the guillotine, these divine words sustain and comfort him: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die (John 2: 25-26). In addition to the many novels which, like the last two named, have at heart a Biblical theme, there are others which more openly announce and portray such themes. One of these, classic in its qualities, is Ben Hur?A Tale of the Christ by Lew Wallace. With master stroke, the author brings back the life and times of the Savior. In Book I?a prelude ?we are brought closer to the story of the birth of the Savior, with vivid descriptions of the shepherds and other humble folk of Judea. We are also made to feel in the story of the Wise Men who followed the star to find the Christ Child, the depth and significance of the Messianic hope. In Book II, we first meet Ben Hur, a young Jew of high birth, and Messala, a young Roman. As children, the two had been playmates. Now, with different training, the one in Jerusalem, the other in Rome, they had reached young manhood with different ideals firmly set. A tragic accident brings the two into their first clash. Ben Hur, unjustly charged with trying to kill a Roman official, is condemned to be a galley slave. At the beginning of his trouble, he is given a first brief contact with Jesus of Nazareth. Crowded years that follow bring him?and the reader?close to dramatic events and scenes, not only on a galley ship, but in regal Rome, in Arabia, and finally back to Jerusalem, where Ben Hur at last finds his king, the Savior of mankind. Just one excerpt from this masterful novel can be given here to illustrate how the story of the Master is made to live again. After a portrayal of the life of the lowly shepherds of Judea, in person and in spirit, we can see one Of them on watch before the sheepfold on the Holy Night when Christ was born. Faithfully he performs his duty until midnight, then? His task was done; now for the dreamless sleep with which labor blesses its wearied children! He moved toward the fire, but paused; a light was breaking around him, soft and white, like the moon's. He waited breathlessly. The light deepened; things before invisible came to view.... A chill sharper than that of the frosty air?a chill of fear?smote him. He looked up; the stars were gone; the light became a splendor. Then in terror he cried, \"Awake! Awake!\" Up sprang the dogs, and howling ran away. The herds rushed together, bewildered. The men clambered to their feet, weapons in hand. \"What is it?\" they asked in one voice. \"See!\" cried the watchman, \"the sky is on fire!\" Suddenly the light became intolerably bright and they covered their eyes, and dropped upon their knees; then as their souls shrank with fear, they would have died had not a voice said unto them, ?Fear not!? And they listened. \"Fear not: for behold I bring unto you good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people.\" For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior which is Christ the Lord.\"\nThis is just one author's way of bringing a dramatic event closer to us. As with different painters who have taken this and other Biblical subjects for portrayal, various writers make their different word pictures. Yet the basic scene remains ever the same.\nWithin more recent times, we have been given other novels based on the life of the Savior. One of these, The Robe by Lloyd Douglas, has lately won acclaim. Whether it will hold its present popularity remains to be seen. The story, told in more informal, more modern style than Ben Hur, still has many points of similarity with that earlier novel, particularly in its portrayal of Romans, Jews, and Greeks, who provide leading characters for the creative work.\nIn the Gospel of Saint John, the author found lines which touch the heart of the theme. \"They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots\" (John 19:24).\nThis robe, a simple, brown, homespun one, worn by the Savior when he was taken to be crucified, fell by lot to Marcellus, the Roman leader who had carried through the execution of Jesus. Unwillingly and drunkenly, he had performed as a soldier the cruel duty of crucifying one whom he felt was innocent. Later, at a banquet with icering Roman companions, Marcellus had donned the sacred robe. Suddenly something of ill came over him; he\nwatchful care of his servant Demetrius, he was taken here and there in the hope he might be restored to normal life again.\nAmong those with whom Marcellus was brought into contact, was the Greek Stephenos, or Stephen, who afterward became a martyr for the Christian faith. Stephen, shown the sacred robe, was touched into a train of memories of the Savior. \"He wore it,\" said Stephen, \"when he healed the sick and comforted the sorrowing . . . when he spoke to the multitudes as no man has ever spoken. He wore it when he wept by the cross to die?for me, a humble weaver! . . . and for you (Marcellus)?a wealthy Tribune!?and for you (Demetrius)?a slave.\"\nStephen went on to accuse Marcellus of the death of the Savior. Demetrius tried to stop the earnest Christian, but Marcellus commanded that Stephen proceed.\n\"You did not know what you were doing,\" he continued, \"and you are sorry. . . You, Tribune Marcellus, can make amends for what you have done! He forgave you. I was there. . . . Make friends with him! He is alive! I have seen him! Marcellus did make friends with our Lord. He saw, unable to prevent it, the cruel stoning of Stephen, with the then unconverted, scornful Saul looking on. Through a series of such soul-shaping experiences and faith-promoting incidents, the Robe of Tribune was transformed and restored. At last he and his beloved wife Diana found life everlasting through their Savior and King.\nAnother outstanding recent novel, Joseph in Egypt by Thomas Mann, turns a masterpiece of the Bible to a vital purpose. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 The story of Joseph, sold by his brothers, his life in Egypt in the rich historical and social setting of those long ago times, is portrayed. For the presentation of such a theme with telling effect, the Bible provides basic materials of dramatic cast. Through the more than two centuries since our first prose fiction began to appear, novel after novel, directly or indirectly linked with the Bible, has been printed. Naturally, most of these creations have had brief lives. Others, touching classic heights, have persisted through the years. Some short stories that have certainly won and held place in our hearts are: The Other Wise Man by Henry VanDyke; and A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens; \"J\" Valjean and the Bishop,\" from Les Miserables, by Victor Hugo; A Man Without a Country, by Edward Eve-ret Hale. All these stories in rhythmically beautiful prose, vibrate with true Christian spirit. Hundreds of other creations of like uplift and helpfulness have been created. Many of the stories make no outward mention of the Bible, yet in the actions and the words of the characters they lead the reader to admire and love, one feels true charity, brotherhood, honesty, virtue, and other qualities characteristic of the true follower of the Master. Added to these types of fictional stories, are many that are created just to give good cheer, to open our eyes to beautiful things in nature, to help us appreciate friends and even strangers who come into our midst. Such stories are in tune with the gospel of goodness and happiness. We need mental and spiritual sunshine to fit us for the sterner hours of life. What is required most is a cultivated sense of selection. Far too much of our fiction just preys upon unthinking folk with tales unfit to read?stories that are simply sensational pictures of perturbed lives ending in nothingness. Dissipation of time and precious emotional energy, rather than recreation, ls the main reward of such novels. **But,\" someone will ask, \"how can a choice selection of fictional stories be made?\" Here are a few simple tests that may prove helpful: 1. Does the novel ring true to life and true to truth? 2. Are its characters and its scenes and conversation such as might be introduced with uplift into the home circle? 3. Is it written in language that is both picturesque and rhythmic? Does it lend itself to oral reading? 4. Does it promote faith, courage, cheer, strength of character, practical Christianity? If the story in large measure brings these positive results for good, then it is Bible-inspired. Many of our great authors have acknowledged openly their indebtedness to the Bible; none more impressively than Sir Walter Scott. In the closing hours of his life, this great writer turned to a beloved friend with a request for a book. \"Which book?\" said the friend. \"Need you ask,\" came the reply; \"there is but one.\" Discussion and Activities 1. (a) What are the outward differences between a drama and a novel? How are they essentially alike? (b) What are some qualities that the play and the novel must have to make them worth time? 2. (a) Be ready to answer the roll call LESSON DEPARTMENT 777 of your class with the name of a novel whose title, theme, or spiritual qualities give evidence that it was Bible-inspired. (b) What type of novel, even though there may be no such evidence of its connection with the Bible, still may bring good into our lives? How? 3. (a) Give two reasons why we must cultivate in these days a better sense of selection for created stories, (b) Name one novel or short story which you are willing to defend as not only wholesome but interesting. 4. What is meant by this suggestion: Novels that live and last for most folk are factually sound, true to life, and spiritually wholesome. 5. What can be done to cultivate a taste for choice, wholesome stories?by the home; by the school; by the church? Think in this connection of the following suggestions: a?Voicing good literature round the fireside. B?Occasional \"story hours\" for home socials. C?Encouraging creative authorship in the schools. D?Co-operating with the librarian in providing choice books. Social Science Modern Applications of Moral Principles Lesson 12?Morals in Marriage and Family Relationships Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, March 26, 1946 Lesson Link: Last month's discussion centered around some of the social and moral problems of modern woman. It was shown that the trend toward woman's emancipation has resulted in some confusion and considerable immorality, but that it may also mean a real opportunity for moral development. There have been tendencies on the part of many women to prostitute their sex for the sake of personal advantage, which is a betrayal of both equality and morality. Woman's power over man is profound, and because of this she is given the special responsibility of guarding and guiding the moral advance of all mankind. Lesson aim: To analyze our most basic social institution from the standpoint of moral conduct, listing some of the common faults, and pointing out some of the principles necessary for correction. MARRIAGE is the gateway to family life, and the family is the very hub of social existence. It is here that people are most intimate, most impressionable to the influence of others, and most happy when things are going well. It is here that character is formed. But, despite the fact that the family is the most primary and the most basic of all social institutions, it is in trouble; and one reason for this trouble is the moral degeneration spoken of in earlier lessons. Family stability depends upon moral integrity, and moral integrity depends upon family stability. The two are interrelated, and any deterioration in one will cause a breakdown in the other, which in turn will reinfect the first, so that the two will become locked in a vicious circle of decay and disorganization. And this is exactly what has been happening. For the sake of character we must preserve the family, and for the sake of the family we must preserve character. It is to this end that the present lesson is written.\nPre-Marriage Ethics\nThe period of boy-girl adjustments prior to marriage is usually spoken of as courtship. Here we have a whole series of experimental friendships, personality testings, and habit adjustments. The primary purpose of courtship is preparation for marriage; preparation through interchange, choice, and adjustment.\nSince courtship is essentially a relationship involving two or more persons, it follows that this relationship in which the setting of each is forever kept in mind, and immoral where either one or both become selfish and exploitive in their attitudes and procedures. A successful date from the moral point of view is one that is mutually enriching. In order to save space we will forego any detailed analysis of this problem and will simply list, with brief comment, some of the most common deviations from moral courtship:\n(1) Poor sportsmanship. Many young people are too immature and infantile in their behavior, too easily hurt, too quick to take offense. Instead of being broad-minded and considerate of their partner they remain unreasonably jealous and selfcentered; instead of respecting the personality and moral standards of the other, they coax, tease, banter, drink, or indulge in other ways.\nMany young people are too selfish. They should take themselves less seriously, develop a sense of humor, and at all times be considerate.\n(2) Discourtesy. Frequently, too, courtship is filled with the crudities and discourtesies that mark immaturity and selfishness in personality. Being loud or boisterous in public, slovenly or crude in dress or manners, profane or vulgar in conversation, means being cheap and offensive. Furthermore, bragging about other dates and flirting with others while on a date are extremely discourteous, as are also other means of embarrassing or offending the partner. Those who court should be more gentlemanly and ladylike than they sometimes are, more cultured and refined, more considerate, more courteous.\n(3) Dishonesty. Some people seem to take pride in being a \"man of many loves,\" in adding broken hearts to their score as the Indians used to add scalps to their belts. This, of course, is usually accomplished by insincere flattery (sometimes called \"a line\") along with dishonest behavior designed to lead the other person on. But it is wrong. The price of such deceit and betrayal is human sorrow as deep as any ever known. Love should not be treated as a plaything.\n(4) Intimacy. The problem of unchastity was discussed in an earlier lesson, but there are intimacies short of that which also need attention. Kissing, embracing, and fondling are often indulged in for the sake of a passing thrill, or in order to \"pay\" for a date. Aside from the danger of lost control leading to \"pay\" for a date. Aside from the able experimentation often cheapens sex, spoils love, and conditions the participants against successful marriage. LESSON DEPARTMENT 779 Moderation, reserve, self-control, and above all the feeling of mutual responsibility, should supplant these widespread practices of reckless indulgences and selfish exploitations in the field of intimate conduct. There are other offenses against morality in courtship practice; \"gold-digging,\" for example, and \"going steady\" for personal convenience without serious intent or with little concern for the consequences. But perhaps this is enough to illustrate and to show that selfishness, in no matter what form it may take, is basically immoral, for it corrodes our souls and brings sorrow to our loved ones. The Ethics of Family Relationships This is even more true in marriage than it is in courtship, for the relationship of marriage is so much more intimate, emotional, and continual. Upon entering marriage, each person makes certain pledges and accepts certain risks and responsibilities. Where the responsibilities are ignored and the pledges broken, as they often are, others are wronged and made to suffer. Marriage is a co-operative adventure and without co-operation it fails. Following are some of the common ways in which husband and wife sometimes wrong each other: (1) quarreling, nagging, and bickering continually; (2) holding grudges, bringing up the past, refusing to forgive; (3) bossing, taking unfair advantage, refusing to give in or admit you are wrong; (4) intimidating, belittling, or disparaging the mate in public; (5) sulking, crying, or having temper tantrums in order to get your own way; (6) using money, sex favors, or other power devices to control your partner or inveigle favors from him; (7) taking your mate for granted and making uncompensated demands for money, or favors; (8) expecting and demanding that love be continually demonstrated by sentimental expressions, expensive presents, and the like; (9) living a parasitic life? such as the wife sleeping until noon, leaving the house dirty spending most of her time in social clubs, et cetera; or the husband failing to provide, neglecting responsibility for the children, et cetera; (10) being dishonest and untrue by lying, \"stepping out\" on the mate, or even committing adultery; (11) taking marriage lightly, and then using divorce as a means of escape. The list is not complete, but it is suggestive. Lewis M. Terman, recently studied the marriage grievances of 792 couples and found, out of a list of fifty-seven grievances, the ten greatest for both husband and wife to be as follows, ranked in the order of their seriousness: Grievances of Husbands nags me not affectionate selfish and inconsiderate complains too much interferes with hobbies W. Slovenly in appearance W. Quick-tempered W. Interferes with my discipline W. Conceited W. Insincere Grievances of Wives H. Selfish and inconsiderate H. Unsuccessful in business H. Untruthful RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 H. Complains too much H. Does not show his affection H. Does not talk things over H, harsh with children H. Touchy H. No interest in children H. Not interested in home The great importance of a co-operative attitude and the spirit of fair play between husband and wife can easily be seen from this study. Where people selfishly, or even dishonestly, attempt to turn the privileges of marriage to their own advantage and to exploit other members of the family, love has gone arid marriage has failed. Only in the atmosphere of sacrifice, co-operation, and mutual enrichment can the love that was kindled in courtship endure and mature into a bond of eternal companionship. But the parent-child relationships in the family are equally important to those between husband and wife; in fact, from the point of view of character building and future morality, they are even more important. Here are some of the ways in which parents are sometimes unwise and unethical in their dealings with children: (1) setting poor examples for them, failing to realize that actions speak louder than words, leaving the home atmosphere clouded and soiled; (2) providing inadequate training and guidance, neglecting rather than protecting, failing to meet the needs of the children in sex education, permitting them to engage in unwholesome employment and/or leisure time activities; (3) bossing the children as if they were property, using discipline that is too harsh and cruel, not giving them enough rights and personality freedom; (4) rejecting their children, being hateful and antagonistic toward them, letting them starve for wan, t of love, affection, and emotional security; (5) over-protecting their children, pouring too much affection over them, giving them too many favors, spoiling them. This list also could be extended, but it is sufficient as it stands to illustrate. And here, too, the key to moral relationships is love, co-operation, helpfulness. Post-family Adjustments While the Latter-day Saint family ties are sealed for the eternities, family units, as such, do not remain intact in this life. There are essentially two processes in the changes which may come to a given family: (1) the process of children marrying and moving away, and (2) the process of death and widowhood. We will discuss each of these briefly in turn. The time of \"the empty nest\" is difficult for most parents to face and adjust to, for the struggles and satisfactions incident to child rearing have become a part of their lives and they quite naturally are reluctant to see them go. But though the reluctance is natural, any interference with this normal and inevitable process is unnatural, and likely to lead into trouble. Some parents make the mistake, consciously or unconsciously, of trying to hold on to their children at this time, spoiling them with affection and favors, or interfering with their courtship so that they won't marry and move away. The last or youngest child in the family is particularly susceptible to interference and spoiling of this sort. Sometimes parents, in their desire to hold on, will interfere and \nattempt to control the lives of their children and their children's families after marriage; and this, of course, is a calamity when it happens.\nStill other parents, although successful in letting go of their children, will give up to melancholy and will pine away the rest of their lives in lonesomeness. All of these reactions are mistakes. Parents should plan for the time when they can be relieved of some of the responsibility of family care, so that when it comes they can fill their years full of interesting, creative activity. And parents should learn how to enjoy their children as adults, and their grandchildren and great-grandchildren as they come along. With a little better understanding and a little more effort, in-lay relationships could be much more pleasant and enriching than they are now.\nBereavement; and subsequent adjustment, after the death of a marriage partner is the common experience of nearly half of the married population. Since women live two or three years longer than men on the average, and usually marry men who are two or three years older than themselves to start with, there are many more widows than there are widowers. Statistically speaking, most women can expect to be a widow for four or five years of their lifetime.\nIt is wisdom, then, to expect this crisis; and by planning and preparing for it, to make it as easy and comfortable as possible. With proper forethought and thrift the financial hazard of widowhood can be largely eliminated. With an understanding of widowhood can appreciation of eternal life, the pe-\nriod of mourning can be made considerably easier. While the memory of the deceased should be held in reverence, no good results from continuous mourning. There should come a time of optimism and cheerfulness when life will go on much as before. For the young, remarriage might be the best solution; for the old, memory, activity, and dreams for the future.\nA Word About the Spinster\nApproximately one-tenth of our adult population never marries, and many of these through no fault of their own. Generally speaking, the males who never marry are those who are disqualified on the basis of some defect (physical, mental, social, or moral); while, as a rule, the females that remain single are those of intellect and ability who have not been willing to take any man that came along in order to marry, or who have made themselves less attractive to the opposite sex. They have waited too long by entering a career or going on for higher education. World War II, with the delays and the casualties it involves, will mean that even more older and high calibered women will never have the opportunity of marriage.\nWhile the bachelor has adjustment problems as well as does the spinster, it is the unmarried girl who presents the biggest social and moral problem. She is less independent; more the victim of circumstances, and more sensitive to her condition than is the male. And what is more, she usually has higher character and is in a better position to influence the character of others.\nRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 Another outstanding recent restlessness, resentment, failure, inferiority, frustration, and defeat that the spinster so often experiences are enough sometimes to disorganize her personality and cause her to turn antisocial. She has a sense of loneliness and isolation that somehow keeps her apart from the rest of society, and often, too, she is a target for social ridicule. No wonder so many become nervous, irritable, sour; no wonder a few become psychopathic, homosexual, criminalistic. Fortunately, they are not all like this; a great many are entirely successful in turning their emotional and material drives into other channels, in living happy lives, and in making real contributions to society. But all who are required by circumstances to remain single should be helped to realize that marriage is only a part of life and that, though it is a very desirable part, if it can't be realized, life does not need to lose its meaning nor purpose because of the fact. Social work, nursing, school teaching, or similar work can help substitute for motherhood and in this way happiness can be found and life's purposes fulfilled. Adjustment can be made, and in a moral way. And Finally In concluding this lesson let it be said again that world morality depends quite basically upon marriage and family stability, and that family stability in turn depends fundamentally upon morality. It is the atmosphere or climate of the home that shapes the characters of men, and it is of such things as honesty, responsibility, and love that this climate is composed. Problems for Thought and Action Note: In treating the pre-marriage, marriage and post-marriage, and unmarried stages or phases of family phenomena, this lesson is rather long. If the class leader finds too much material here for one period it might be well to choose that part of the lesson that most closely fits the age and marital status of most class members, and then focus on that. 1. Show how morals and family stability are interrelated. 2. Consider the four points discussed under \"Pre-marriage Ethics,\" give examples of each, and discuss the various moral implications. Can you name other types of unethical behavior in courtship? Why is selfishness so much a part of them all? 3. Do the same for the various points under \"The Ethics of Family Relationships\" as you did in problem 2 above. What significance does Terman's study have to the problem of morale and happiness in marriage? Discuss. Show why co-operation is important in parent-child relationships as well as in those between husband and wife. 4. How does the reluctance on the part of parents to have an \"empty nest\" explain their occasional interference in the courtship of younger children and sometimes in the married lives of other children? Show why this is a mistake. How can parents be happy in old age after the children have gone? Why are there so many more widows than widowers? Make helpful suggestions on the problem of adjusting to widowhood. 5. What percentage of the adult population never marries? Why are spinsters usually of a higher quality than bachelors? Why is the problem of the unmarried woman more serious than that of the unmarried man? Name some of the most common adjustment problems of the spinster and make suggestions for solving them.

PEACE Christie Lund Coles Christmas Day These who have walked in ravaged, war-torn places, Have known the quivering fear, the aching sense Of insecurity, the blanched, wan faces, The futility of man's bitter defense Against his fellow. They know at last That this dark, troubled path is not the way The heart of man would go. Searching the past, He seeks the miracle recalled today. He seeks the answer and the soft echo Of the hope long hid in his mind's keeping: These bells of Christmas ringing through the snow, The story told again to a world, weeping; The promise by the herald angels spoken-Peace for each searching soul, each heart broken. What is Peace? What is the peace the star led men toward. Over the silent land, the greening hill. Where shepherds watched and quiet night, deep-starred, Knew yet another luminous star, to fill The earth with light and herald angels' song; That brought his life to stand against a world Consuming itself by its iniquity. Peace must be nurtured in the human heart Where his great love and mercy planted it, Must grow as man grows, man's must be the part To make reality of holy writ, That he may speak again, still promising That love is all and some day shall be king.
