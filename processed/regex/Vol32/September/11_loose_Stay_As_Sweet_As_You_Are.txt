Stay as Sweet as You Are Ada B. Monson JIMMY was leading the way to the far side of the big waiting room. You shouldn't have come, Mother,? he said. ?Train stations are tough assignments for mothers these days." Mrs. Leeder started to speak. Jimmy interrupted, "Don't say it, Mother, I will?"the tougher the job, the harder you tackle." They both laughed and sat down on a long bench. Jimmy put. His suitcase between them on the seat. They both rested their arms on it and Jimmy put his hand over his mother's. "Seriously, Mother, Fm very grateful for all the sweet philosophy you've dished up for me. I'm gonna need it, but sure." Mrs. Leeder tried to smile, but her chin went wobbly. Then to herself?I musn't cry, I musn't cry. I must talk, that's it, I must talk every minute to keep from crying. Boys in khaki and blue were dashing hatless and coatless in and out of the station between trains. "They keep that girl at the newsstand really busy, and look, Jimmy, there are Fred and his mother coming in now, see, at the middle door?" Mrs. Leeder stood up to wave at them. Jimmy put out a restraining hand. "Let's stay here. Mother," he said. Mrs. Leeder sat down, "Why sure?all right," she said. "You'll get to see them out at the train," Jimmy said. He's afraid I'll break down in front of them all, she thought, but she said, "I hope you two boys can stick together through this like you did through growing up." "Can't though. Fred'll go in the air corps," Jimmy said. "Oh, I didn't know. Poor Ruth. She won't have anyone at home, now." "You be sure and call her up, sometimes." "Oh, I will. Son?every day," Mrs. Leeder said. Jimmy smiled. "She'll be calling you up, too." Mrs. Leeder smiled back and a lump came in her throat again. Talk fast, talk fast. "Fred's mother is a beautiful woman, isn't she?" "Yeah," Jimmy said, "clothes do an awful lot." Mrs. Leeder put her feet further under the seat and straightened up a bit. "I guess I could have worn my hat," she said, smoothing her hair with a workworn hand. "I've got those gloves you gave me for Christmas, too." Never before had she been so aware of her shabbiness, her lack of style. "You sure you don't want to see Ruth, Son?" she asked. Jimmy shook his head. "We said goodbye last night." He changed the subject quickly. "Wonder how I'll look in G. I. Cloth?" Page  "You'll look beautiful. Just beautiful? Mrs. Leeder said. They both laughed a little. Then, noticing the sudden activity, they both glanced at the clock. ?It's time, Mother," he said. She put out a hand, then quickly drew it back. Already he was standing, his suitcase in his hand. "No, Mother?don't get up?and don't come out to the train. I'd like it best this way." With one fleeting look at her he dashed through the door that led to the trains. Mrs. Leeder's glance followed him until he was lost in the crowd. She sat still on the long bench. It was funny how all alone she felt with so many people around her. At the other end of the room she could see Mrs. Chambers sobbing in Fred's arms. Fred was using his handkerchief on his own eyes, then they went out to the train. After a while, Mrs. Leeder stood up and went out the entrance toward home. Well, anyway, she hadn't cried. She had promised herself she wouldn't cry. But now she could let down if she wanted to. Funny she didn't, seem to be able to shed tears. It had all turned out so differently from the way she had expected. She was sure Jimmy had acted unnatural. He had kept that old suitcase between them so she couldn't take his hand or get close to him. And he didn't kiss her goodbye, or even take her in his arms. A December snow was falling. She buttoned her coat more closely around her. A plate-glass door panel caught her reflection. She paused, then started on?came back and stood still, shoving her hands deep into her coat pockets and straightening her shoulders. Then, after a minute, she hurried on. The picture she had seen wasn't exactly pleasing. Certainly not anything like Mrs. Chambers. Jimmy had said, "Clothes can do an awful lot." Jimmy hadn't wanted to join his friends. Could it be that he was? she wouldn't say it. Jimmy wasn't like that. And yet?something had been wrong. Suddenly she felt hollow inside, an emptiness which she couldn't shake off. That was it? of course it was. She had been so busy making a living for the two of them and getting Jimmy through school for the last five years she just hadn't taken time out to keep herself up. She hadn't been in a beauty shop for?well she couldn't remember. Oh dear! She had let Jimmy down, not purposely, but down, just the same. The wind blew little wisps of hair around her face, and suddenly it seemed colder. She buried her chin and nose down beneath her storm collar and hurried homeward. That's what she needed?home-home and a good cry.  IT was October and Mrs. Leeder entered the depot and walked over to the train schedule. Number Twenty-Six was due at nine o'clock. It was eight now. She stopped a redcap. "Can you tell me when Number Twenty-Six comes in from San Francisco?" she asked. "Nine o'clock, Mam," he said. She thanked him and walked to the far end of the waiting room. She placed one foot slightly back of the other one and sat down gracefully. Martin leaned back, she thought, always keep the back perfectly straight, shoulders relaxed. One of the beauty lessons had said, "Always choose chairs with a firm seat, or the knees might collide with the chin." Well, this seat was firm enough, and it was on this same seat that a mother had said goodbye to her son last December. And now, after almost a year, she was here to meet him, with one hour to wait.
Yes, she had been the mother, but a very different one. That mother wore a coat that slapped her legs too far below the knees; had straight hair pinned in a tight knot at the back of her neck, and broken nails; she had also had the analgesic not to wear a hat or gloves.
She recalled words from lesson twenty-seven: "Street clothes should be chosen with utmost care. Suits are best, and careful attention must be paid to accessories."
A little smile played about her lips as she slowly and nonchalantly tugged at the glove on her left hand. She removed only one. She wanted to admire again her long lacquered nails. Leisurely she worked the fingers back into the soft kid. Underneath her tailored suit her heart was racing. She glanced at the clock. Forty-five more minutes to wait for Jimmy. Would he like her? He'd be surprised, she knew. Maybe he wouldn't know her with her? He'd be surprised, she knew. hat with bright feathers right smack on the top. She was all of an inch taller in these new shoes, too.
Pretty minutes to go!
She just couldn't sit there that long, she'd have to move about. The place hadn't changed much in a year?the same clanging of trains and the same calling of trains, except that now the voice came from a loudspeaker overhead. Everywhere, boys in khaki and blue rushed in to buy magazines, candy, and postcards, then dashed out to get on their trains.
Mrs. Leeder found herself moving with them out to the platform. Soon a long train slowed to a stop. She noticed a neatly dressed woman in a fur coat and red-feathered hat glancing anxiously up and down; white dozens of men in uniform spilled out of the cars. A smooth-faced sailor with a cane and a slight limp detached himself from the crowd and hurried toward the woman. "Mother!" he exclaimed, "I hardly knew you." He clasped her in his arms.
"Boy?your coat. Mother, can you still afford mink with a war going on?" He laughed and patted her arm. "But I love you anyway. Mother. Gosh, is this black hair a wig, or does it wash out? I liked your hair with gray in it. But of course you are glamorous." He squeezed her again and guided her laughingly through the crowd. Mrs. Leeder watched them disappear.
Finally she came to the end of the platform and automatically turned and started walking back. She thought she knew what the boy had meant when he had referred to his mother's mink coat. He had tried to laugh it off but he hadn't liked her hair, either. It was awfully black for such a wrinkled face. Mrs. Leeder guessed the boys liked to find things the same when they came back from the war. And now she was glad she hadn't rearranged the furniture or moved the rose garden. And jolly well glad she was that she didn't have a new fur coat to plague her. Yes, she felt cozy in the thought that Jim would find everything about the same. The same? She ran her gloved hand up the back of her neck. Those loose locks on an up-sweep were so annoying! Up-sweep! And her hat was a monstrosity, so her boss had said. But then, men didn't know anything about women's hats. But it was more than that. Her nails were so long she'd given up playing the piano months ago. Mrs. Leeders' heart did a drop act. She ran inside and looked at the clock. Eighteen minutes to go. Like one pursued, she ran to the ladies' lounge. Behind a screen she found a dressing table and a chair. Frantically she tore off her hat,"" pulled out combs from her hair. A big black face appeared around the screen. "Ah's Mandy," it said. "You all seemed in such a powah-ful hurry. Cain I do somp'in foah you all?" Mrs. Leeder's heart came back into place for the first time in minutes. "Oh, Mandy," she exclaimed, "Never again will I doubt that prayers are answered. If you can lengthen this skirt two inches in ten minutes, you can name your price. Just baste it in, of course." Mrs. Leeder was already slipping it off. "Ah'11 be right back, quick as scat," Mandy said, and left with the skirt over her arm. Mrs. Leeder studied herself for a second in the mirror. She hurriedly wiped off the heavy print of lipstick, leaving just enough, then turned her attention to her hair. She ran her comb through it several times, until it fell glistening to her shoulders. Then deftly she pushed the soft waves loosely around her face and wound the length into a low bob on her neck. Then, with a nail file she set to work on her nails. Surely, swiftly, in no time at all, she had filed away the sharp claws, rounding the ends and smoothing them off. "Heah's you' skirt. Ma'am, and right on de dot a ten minutes," Mandy said, holding the skirt toward her. "Oh, thanks. Thanks, Mandy," Mrs. Leeder said, "help me pull it on, will you? It can't go on over my head, or my hair will be mussed. There. I'll fasten it. Run, see the time, please," slipping her a quarter. Mrs. Leeder finished dressing and hurried out to the platform, and stood among others who were waiting. From far away came the long, lonesome whistle of Number Twenty-Six. Everyone suddenly stood at attention, looking down the long track to where it curved out of sight. Mrs. Leeder thought, it won't be long now. Her stomach did a flip-flop. Again the whistle gave vent to two longs, one short, and a long, and soon the train came in, its engine puffing and panting. Mrs. Leeder's feet seemed glued to the platform. How could anyone see all the cars at once? She decided to stand in one place, near the main entrance. Then, if she didn't see Jimmy, he would see her after the crowd had thinned out.
But after a little while when the crowd had thinned out, and still no Jimmy, Mrs. Leeder grew anxious. Could it be that Jimmy had missed his train? There was another one due from the Coast in about nine minutes. But the telegram had said he would be on Number Twenty-Six.
There were two soldiers standing a little way down the platform. Maybe they could tell her something, she thought, as she started over to where they stood. One was bareheaded, and wearing dark glasses.
They were looking at her now and walking toward her.
"Why?that boy's hair is like Jimmy's!" she thought, but he didn't look like?yes, he did. It was the dark glasses that had puzzled her. It was funny!?Oh, Jimmy?Jimmy couldn't see. Her fast strides broke into a run, and then her arms were about him, holding him tight, tight.
She wanted to say so many things. She wanted to tell him it didn't matter. But not a sound would come for years. She just could only press them tight together and pray for it it had been important that she keep from crying when he went away, it was doubly so now.
She felt his fingers exploring her face, then her hair, and the loose softness must have confused him?then crinkly the eager fingers sought and found the low bob at the back of her neck. A smile relieved the sternness of his mouth. "It's all right, Lieutenant," he said, turning to the soldier. "This is my mother. Thanks for standing by me." He held out his hand and the Lieutenant shook it warmly, lifted his cap to Mrs. Leeder, then hastily left them.
Guiding Jimmy carefully through the station, she called a cab and they got in.
"That was Lieutenant Conrey. He's swell. On the train I told him about you. I said, 'You'll know my mother. She maybe won't be wearing a hat or gloves, and she combs her hair awful plain and wears it in a little knot on the back of her head.' Gosh, Mother, he knew you right off?"
Mrs. Leeder leaned over and laid her cheek against his.
"Oh, Jimmy," she said.
