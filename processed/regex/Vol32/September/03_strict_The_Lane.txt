THE LANE Daphne Jemmett In Idaho there is a lane That wanders on at will. Until it takes you to a house With flowers on the sill; And over it a willow tree Whose weeping branches fall. Close to the flowers on the sill. The roses on the wall. Now, often, when I hear men speak Of places they hold dear. In various portions of the earth, Both very far, and near. In memory my thoughts return And I can plainly see That wandering lane in Idaho, The little house and tree. Nellie O. Parker Former Member Relief Society General Board The little house and tree. Planning For Safety THE great number of accidents occurring in the homes of America has intensified research into their causes. It has been found that many accidents are due to faulty home design, unsafe equipment, and careless actions. If the greatest degree of safety is to be obtained, careful consideration must be given to the elimination of hazards which are known to produce accidents. This may require changes in the house plan, rearrangement of the. Furniture, provision of places for putting things away, or the addition of more light to entrances, passages, and stairways. The National Safety Council tells us that falls cause about two-thirds of all home tragedies. All stairs should have an easy ascent with equal step heights or rises and treads of equal width. Sturdy hand rails should be provided. Good lighting is essential and may be secured by placing a switch at both the top and the bottom of the stairs. There should be non-slip floor surfaces and well-secured carpeting. Loose metal step guards or small throw rugs are malicious hazards. Rooms with floor levels of varying heights?a step up to the dining room or one down to the living room?are a constant danger. Any door opening into a hall should swing roomward and should not open directly on a down stairway. If this arrangement cannot be avoided, a safety lock should be placed on the door to give time for realization of a potential fall. Overhead obstructions should be removed or painted white, especially in the basement and attic stairways. Top and bottom steps, when painted white, will indicate when the end is reached. A gate to bar the stairs is essential if there are toddlers around. The bathroom is often the scene of falls, scalds, and burns if the equipment is not arranged to prevent them. The tub should have a flat bottom with at least one strong, solid grip on the wall to hold on to when getting in and out of the tub or shower. There should be a non-slip mat on the floor and a good container should be provided to keep soap out of the way. The water should be kept below scalding, about 125? Fahrenheit. Records tell of fatal results to children from too hot water being turned on them. Electric switches should be placed outside the bathroom or beyond reach of the tub or shower. Never touch an electrical appliance with wet hands. Many older people, as well as children, die from falls and burns in bedrooms. There should be light fixtures at both doors and bedsides. See that there is a straight path from the bed to the door to avoid bumping or falling over furniture. Children should be provided with safe cribs having the slats close enough to prevent the baby's head Page  being caught between them. Be sure that children's furniture and toys are painted with non-poisonous compounds. Reliable dealers should know the ingredients of their paints. Radiant heaters should be placed away from materials that could be ignited, and heating pads should be placed away from materials that could be ignited, and heating pads should be kept in good repair to prevent burns.
Windows need careful consideration. If they can be arranged to swing or turn in for cleaning, a very definite falling hazard will be eliminated, as sitting or leaning out of windows to wash them is dangerous. Screens and storm windows should be adjusted from the inside and the catches on all screens should be strong and secure.
The roof design of a home should be kept simple and the attic well insulated to eliminate the necessity of removing snow and ice from the eaves and gutters in heavy winter weather.
Make the living room livable by grouping the furniture where it will be most used, leaving clear paths for family traffic. Provide enough electric plug-ins to eliminate the necessity for long cords which may be tripped over or broken. Sew weights or rubber fruit rings on the under side of rugs to keep them flat and secure them from slipping or tripping. Use non-skid wax on the floors.
The kitchen is the most dangerous room in the house. Children should be kept out while cooking or canning is going on. All equipment should be kept in good repair. Shelves should be placed within reach, or where this cannot be done, a sturdy stepladder with wide treads or "step stool" should be used. Stoves with an open flame should not be closer than twelve to eighteen inches from a window. Curtains should be securely fastened so they won't blow over the flame and ignite. All floors, walls, and chimneys should be properly insulated from heating stoves. Matches and all sharp instruments should be put away from little fingers.
More than half of the home accidents happen outside the home. Provide adequate light for porch steps and walks. If paths cannot be cleaned from snow and ice, they should be sprinkled with salt or ashes. Clean rain gutters will form fewer icicles. Clothes lines should be arranged higher than the head or placed out of the line of traffic.
Take advantage of foresight and planning to prevent home tragedies. Good housekeeping is safe housekeeping.Therefore,... See that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again. For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored (Alma 41:14-15). His First Teacher Mildred Y. Hunt ONE of the ever-increasing wonders of my world is the capacity of the child mind for receiving impressions. In his quest for learning he is inexhaustible. In the beginning, his questions were very simple and the main problem was framing replies in language that he could understand. Day by day his interest has widened and with it my responsibility, for I must weave the type of fabric which I desire to be the basis of his future education. This is a part of motherhood in which I have always believed, but not until my own child reached this stage did its possibilities rise before me in such limitless proportions. The impressions made now, upon virgin soil, will take root and live to shape the conduct of his entire life. That which concerns me most at this stage is the foundation of religion. I feel certain that the responsibility for this belongs essentially to me, rather than to those who teach him outside of home. Their contribution will help, but mine is the task of building the main structure. Sunday School and Primary lessons will be more beneficial if he has a background of religious knowledge. It is well that repetition does not bore him, for each retelling strengthens his knowledge and widens his understanding. The characters of the Bible are real and interesting. He never tires of hearing about Jesus and all the incidents and happenings that bring out the beauty and purity of his life. Joseph Smith, too, lives for him in all his nobility. Adam, Enoch, and Noah, the stories of Joseph and the enslavement of the children of Israel, and their delivery by Moses are as interesting to him as any characters of fiction. This is the wonderful thing about teaching him, for once the child's interest is gained the teacher's work is easy and pleasurable. Our Church leaders have stressed the importance of early training for children. According to President Grant: The Lord has said that it is our duty to teach our children in their youth. Children are not born with a knowledge of the gospel. Each one must learn and study and gain that knowledge for himself. Brigham Young was very explicit in his direction to mothers: Let mothers commence to teach their children while in their laps; there do you teach them to love the Lord and keep his commandments.... If you, mothers, will live your religion, then in the love and fear of God teach your children constantly and thoroughly in the ways of life and salvation, training them up in the way they should go, and when they are old they will not depart from it. If we do not take the pains to train our children, to teach and " instruct them concerning these revealed truths, the condemnation will be upon us as parents. Page 547 The value of family prayers in training children for religious and spiritual lives cannot be over estimated. Sincerity and humility on the part of the parents seeking the spirit of the Lord in the home is one of the first profound impressions to be made on young minds.
It is easy to let less important tasks crowd out these essential activities. One of the most potent weapons of the adversary is procrastination. Our lives today move at a rapid tempo, but it is more important than ever that we remain calm, and hold fast to the enduring and everlasting principles of the salvation of souls.
for us but also for our children. Not one of the tasks constantly tugging at us is important enough to justify neglect of the great trust which is ours in the training of these little ones.
And so, of the two precious years that remain before I give him over to others to teach, there is no time to waste. In studying for the information which I must have in order to meet this goal, I, too, shall be immeasurably benefited. We shall share a rich and happy experience together which we shall be better able to give to others. MATES Edward R. Tuttle The fabric of their love was never one Of fragile texture, made with silken twine And weft of dreams that later might be done, Somehow, into a workable design; But, was the homespun of a pent-up street Where pain-worn dwellers scarcely knew the soil. Expectancy had seldom turned their feet From an accustomed rendezvous with toil. They had preferred to let a slower growth Mature the rugged fibers in their care, Until a loom of years could furnish both With proper raiment for enduring wear. The mute concessions of this man and wife Had given each the condiments of life. The Radiant Spirit A FANTASY Miranda Snow Walton IN the Beautiful Kingdom lay a broad, white roadway running like a pearled ribbon from the Mountain of the Great Throne to the Silver Sea. Many people, young and old, traveled along the Highway, for it was the Road of Life. This is a tale of two men who journeyed thereon.
Now, there was a legend in the Beautiful Kingdom that when a man had traversed the Highway's length, even unto the shores of the Silver Sea, the Radiant One would take him by the hand, and lead him into an enchanted land, where his eyes would behold things too beautiful for mortal men to look upon. None had ever returned to tell of its wonder, for the law was that a traveler walked that way but once.
It was springtime when Jan and Justin began their pilgrimage. All the earth was made fair and lovely by the silvery sunshine that fell from happy skies. Birds and flowers grew in rich abundance, and birds' celestial music filled the air like a blessed benediction.
Jan was in ecstasy. Nothing, he thought, could be as beautiful as this; no, not even the vision of the Radiant One.
Each day, each hour, brought new delight to his soul, and his feet tarried along the trail until Justin became impatient.
"Hurry," he would call to Jan,
"these are only flowers and trees and birds which we can see every day. Why linger among these common things? Let us not stop until we have reached the Silver Sea."
He would have hastened ahead, but he could not, for it had been decreed that they journey together. He complained bitterly when Jan delayed while they listened to the rustling of moonlit pines.
"Angel whispers, they are," he told Justin, but Justin could only hear the branches scraping one against the other, and he fretted to be on his way, until his heart became filled with worry and resentment.
Summer came, and passed; then autumn and the earth was more beautiful than it had been in the springtime. To Jan, each scarlet leaf became a miracle, each golden tree more exquisite than the last, and where green fields had lain in lazy loveliness, now abundant harvests gave the promise of royal riches to all men. But Justin's impatience waxed more strong.
"The nights are becoming chill," he complained, "it will soon be winter, and it is still a far journey to the Silver Sea."
"Yes, I know the nights are chill," said Jan, "but the stars hang low and close like diamonds upon earth's pure breast, and I would drink of this beauty while I can, for we will pass this way but once." So they tarried until the winter of life was upon them, and their footsteps faltered many times, for their bodies were tired from their long journeying. They knew now that they would soon reach the Silver Sea, and Justin inlaid his companion bitterly.
"See," he said, "you have wasted our strength and time along the way on transient trifles. Our eyes are dim with age. Tell me, how can we now see the Radiant One?"
And Jan replied, "I am glad for the experiences of the springtime, for summer's clouds and showers, for the recompense of the harvest. These things have given me power to understand the immenity of that which is to come."
Then the day came when they stepped beyond the sunset into the Silver Sea. With eager, expectant eyes they looked for the Radiant One, as the legend had told them.
Justin spoke first. "We are too late, or we have missed our way. This is only another sea, like the many we have passed, and I do not
I see a person standing in the sun."
But Jan did not hear, for his ears were filled with the chant of angel choirs, his eyes were filled with the beauty that was too great for mortal man to look upon. His soul stood singing, for it knew the ecstasy of immortality, the glory and the joy of heavenly things, the wonder of eternity.
The Radiant One took him by the hand.
"Only those who have known me as they journeyed along the way of life can see me here. I walk with all men, but there are those who will not see and some who will not hear. Blessed are you, Jan, for you have seen me in the sunrise, and in the sacred silence of a higher noon; have known me when I manifested myself in acts of kindness by fellow travelers. You have felt my presence when life storms of the obscured your vision. I bless you, Jan, with eternal joy. I am the one whose mission it is to give happiness to men. I am the Spirit of Appreciation."
