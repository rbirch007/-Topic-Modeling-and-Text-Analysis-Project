Planning For Safety THE great number of accidents occurring in the homes of America has intensified research into their causes. It has been found that many accidents are due to faulty home design, unsafe equipment, and careless actions. If the greatest degree of safety is to be obtained, careful consideration must be given to the elimination of hazards which are known to produce accidents. This may require changes in the house plan, rearrangement of the. Furniture, provision of places for putting things away, or the addition of more light to entrances, passages, and stairways. The National Safety Council tells us that falls cause about two-thirds of all home tragedies. All stairs should have an easy ascent with equal step heights or rises and treads of equal width. Sturdy hand rails should be provided. Good lighting is essential and may be secured by placing a switch at both the top and the bottom of the stairs. There should be non-slip floor surfaces and well-secured carpeting. Loose metal step guards or small throw rugs are malicious hazards. Rooms with floor levels of varying heights?a step up to the dining room or one down to the living room?are a constant danger. Any door opening into a hall should swing roomward and should not open directly on a down stairway. If this arrangement cannot be avoided, a safety lock should be placed on the door to give time for realization of a potential fall. Overhead obstructions should be removed or painted white, especially in the basement and attic stairways. Top and bottom steps, when painted white, will indicate when the end is reached. A gate to bar the stairs is essential if there are toddlers around. The bathroom is often the scene of falls, scalds, and burns if the equipment is not arranged to prevent them. The tub should have a flat bottom with at least one strong, solid grip on the wall to hold on to when getting in and out of the tub or shower. There should be a non-slip mat on the floor and a good container should be provided to keep soap out of the way. The water should be kept below scalding, about 125? Fahrenheit. Records tell of fatal results to children from too hot water being turned on them. Electric switches should be placed outside the bathroom or beyond reach of the tub or shower. Never touch an electrical appliance with wet hands. Many older people, as well as children, die from falls and burns in bedrooms. There should be light fixtures at both doors and bedsides. See that there is a straight path from the bed to the door to avoid bumping or falling over furniture. Children should be provided with safe cribs having the slats close enough to prevent the baby's head Page  being caught between them. Be sure that children's furniture and toys are painted with non-poisonous compounds. Reliable dealers should know the ingredients of their paints. Radiant heaters should be placed away from materials that could be ignited, and heating pads should be placed away from materials that could be ignited, and heating pads should be kept in good repair to prevent burns.
Windows need careful consideration. If they can be arranged to swing or turn in for cleaning, a very definite falling hazard will be eliminated, as sitting or leaning out of windows to wash them is dangerous. Screens and storm windows should be adjusted from the inside and the catches on all screens should be strong and secure.
The roof design of a home should be kept simple and the attic well insulated to eliminate the necessity of removing snow and ice from the eaves and gutters in heavy winter weather.
Make the living room livable by grouping the furniture where it will be most used, leaving clear paths for family traffic. Provide enough electric plug-ins to eliminate the necessity for long cords which may be tripped over or broken. Sew weights or rubber fruit rings on the under side of rugs to keep them flat and secure them from slipping or tripping. Use non-skid wax on the floors.
The kitchen is the most dangerous room in the house. Children should be kept out while cooking or canning is going on. All equipment should be kept in good repair. Shelves should be placed within reach, or where this cannot be done, a sturdy stepladder with wide treads or "step stool" should be used. Stoves with an open flame should not be closer than twelve to eighteen inches from a window. Curtains should be securely fastened so they won't blow over the flame and ignite. All floors, walls, and chimneys should be properly insulated from heating stoves. Matches and all sharp instruments should be put away from little fingers.
More than half of the home accidents happen outside the home. Provide adequate light for porch steps and walks. If paths cannot be cleaned from snow and ice, they should be sprinkled with salt or ashes. Clean rain gutters will form fewer icicles. Clothes lines should be arranged higher than the head or placed out of the line of traffic.
Take advantage of foresight and planning to prevent home tragedies. Good housekeeping is safe housekeeping.Therefore,... See that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again. For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored (Alma 41:14-15).
