THE LANE Daphne Jemmett In Idaho there is a lane That wanders on at will. Until it takes you to a house With flowers on the sill; And over it a willow tree Whose weeping branches fall. Close to the flowers on the sill. The roses on the wall. Now, often, when I hear men speak Of places they hold dear. In various portions of the earth, Both very far, and near. In memory my thoughts return And I can plainly see That wandering lane in Idaho, The little house and tree. Nellie O. Parker Former Member Relief Society General Board The little house and tree.
