I AM PEACE Ivy Houtz Woolley Drenched with blood are my robes of white, My eyes have wept out all their light; Bruised are my feet with broken steel, Sad is my heart; my senses reel  For I am Peace. I have been crushed and wounded sore. Unheard is my voice in cannons' roar, Unfelt my touch, save by dying ones As they clasp their hands 'round smoking guns-But I am Peace. The mother alone with her empty chairs Can hear my voice, yet she hardly dares To hope that I am still on earth To spare the ones that she gave birth Still I am Peace. I must spur forth, fling wide my door. To bring my countries back once more, And turn their darkness into light; They shall live through this dreadful night  For I am Peace.
