literature. Mother was married in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City to George H. Taggart when she was only sixteen years of age. The ceremony was performed by President Joseph F. Smith. Father had been sent with his father to Morgan to build a flour mill which was the first one in that part of the State. Mother's first child was born when she was seventeen years of age, and from then on her children came about every two years. The family was very poor, and she was tried in many, many ways; but she was naturally of a cheerful, determined disposition, with a good sense of humor, and she made the best of every situation. There were no doctors in the community, so grandmother decided to be an obstetrician. She was the only one in Morgan for many years, and she did most of her work without monetary compensation. She must have been a good midwife, for she cared for my mother through sixteen, completely successful confinements. There was no chloroform in those days and child bearing was not the relatively easy matter it is today. I can see grandmother now with a little black lace bonnet on her head, a shoulder shawl, and a satchel, about which we were very curious as children. She would come every day for ten days, then, with the help of the older children, mother would again assume her responsibilities. As Christmas time approaches, my thoughts always revert to my childhood. Our Christmas presents were few and simple. Among the presents I shall always remember were the silver rings father made for us out of silver coins. Dimes were used in making those for the smaller children, and quarters were used for the larger ones. He made our doll cradles, beds, sheet-iron stoves, with an oven and stovepipe, for mud pies. Mother always knitted new stockings for us; I was quite a young lady when I had my first "store stocking."
As the family increased in number and the boys grew older (there were ten of them), father began to wonder what to do with us all. Being a tradesman, he had no land excepting the acre on which our home was built. For young people to leave home in those days to find work in the cities was considered a dangerous thing. About this time, the year 1900, Governor DeForest Richards, and Secretary of State Fentemore Chatterton visited President Lorenzo Snow and counselors asking for a colony of Mormons to be sent to the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming. President Snow appointed Owen Woodruff, of the Council of the Twelve, to take charge of the project, as he had been out to Burlington, Wyoming, and had organized a ward there. He had been shown the Greybull Valley and had seen the crops produced there, samples of which he had brought back to Salt Lake. He found that a permit had been issued August 10, 1896, to the Cincinnati Canal Company to build a canal that would irrigate a large tract of land on the north side of the Shoshone River. This company had sent the Honorable Frank Mondell, who at that time was United States senator from Wyoming, to make a report on the feasibility of building the canal. He had reported that it was impossible to accomplish such a project, so it had been abandoned and the permit had expired and had been advertised for bids by November 14, 1898.
Elder Woodruff filed an application for this same tract of land on January 11, 1900, before the Land Board of Wyoming. On February 2, 1900, Elder Woodruff requested the following gentlemen to meet him in Ogden, Utah, for the purpose of making a trip to the Big Horn Basin with a view to establishing a colony there: Byron Sessions of Woodruff, Rich County; H. K. North, Salt Lake County; George H. Taggart, Morgan County; John and William Simmons, Charles A. Welch, and John Croft of Morgan County; Brigham L. Tippets and William B. Graham of Bennington, Idaho; John Stephens and S. P. Sorenson of Montpelier, Idaho; Bishop N. P. Larsen and Mr. Gumsey of Thomas Fork, Bear Lake County. Most of these men had been farmers in their own communities, but none of them had had any scientific training of any kind. However, after going over the tract of land, the party decided there was a future for the country, that it was good cattle land, and that the opportunity for home building in many places was good.
Elder Woodruff made a report to the General Authorities of the Church. It was favorably received, and he was appointed to take charge of the colonization. Franklin S. Richards drew up articles of incorporation for the Big Horn Basin Colonization Company. The organization of this company was effected in Salt Lake City, April 9, 1900, but the company was organized under the laws of the State of Wyoming.
THE first settlers left their homes in Salt Lake City and began their journey to the Big Horn on April 13, 1900. They started in the Year, in order to avoid high water season, as many streams had to be forded, there being no bridges over most of them. THE BIG HORN BASIN 79 MORMON PATHFINDERS TO THE BIG HORN BASIN, WYOMING Front row: George H. Taggart, Byron Sessions, Abraham O. Woodruff, William B. Graham, Brigham L. Tippetts, S. P. Sorenson. Back row: Charles A. Welch, Hyrum K. North, John Stevens, William G. Simmons, John J. Simmons. The people were organized into companies similar to the way in which the early Mormon pioneers had been organized. My father was captain of one of these companies. My two brothers, John Robert and Bruce, and two sisters, Rebecca and Nettie, were in this company. (Mother and the other members of the family remained at home until later.) They traveled one whole month before they reached their destination. The same distance and practically the same route is now traveled in eighteen hours by automobile. They encountered many difficulties. There were no roads, just trails; and the weather was bad all the way. During the heavy storms the horses were without food except for the oats the men had taken with them. The men would tie quilts about the horses to keep them from freezing to death, while they, in turn, would sit around a campfire to keep themselves warm. There was considerable sickness, one little child dying of pneumonia. Father made a coffin for her from the end gates of wagons, and she was sent back to Utah for burial. The broken-hearted parents had to carry on. The group arrived in the Basin May 24, 1900. Tents were pitched as there was not a house within a radius of fifty miles. Just three days later the first ecclesiastical organization was effected with 127 persons present. PIONEER COMPANIES NUMBERS 2 AND 3 AT HAMS FORK A Sunday School, Mutual Improvement Association, and Relief Society were organized. Lucy F. Grant, sister-in-law of President Heber J. Grant and wife of Morgan Grant, was the first Relief Society president. This was a new country in very deed. The people were faced with many obstacles and trials of all kinds. There were no roads, no towns within fifty miles, no doctors within a hundred miles. Some of the people lived in tents, some in sheep wagons, and all realized it would be months and perhaps years before they would enjoy the real comforts of life. There was no mail service, and letters had to be taken to some roadside ranch many miles away, where the stagecoach would pick them up. Rattlesnakes, lizards, - spiders, et cetera, were plentiful, and everyone had to be on the alert for them at all times. There was no feed for animals, except salt sage and a little grass. There was scarcely any grain in the country. Food had to be freighted in, and everything was very expensive. On May 28, 1900, these good people knelt in prayer on the spot that was to be the head of the canal, and they asked for God's blessings upon them. Elder Woodruff officiated. Then the work on the canal began in earnest, and very hard work it was, lasting for weeks and months, with the wind constantly blowing and the dry sand flying. It was decided that each morning and evening while work was going forward on the canal a bugle would call the camp members together to sing praises to God, and to ask for his aid. Elder Woodruff, in outlining the task that was before them, admonished the people to be united, not to profane the name of Deity, to keep the Word of Wisdom, pay tithing, and keep the Sabbath Day holy. He promised the people that if they would do these things the Lord would be a kind of Zion unto them and their children. He said, "And that you may be united, I view, as an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, call each and everyone of you upon a mission to help build up this country, and if you will do this, the Lord will bless you forever."
Men who had only gone to see the country were so impressed they decided to remain. To enable a people to perform any work, whatsoever, requires that they have faith in the ultimate result. No farmer would plant unless he expected to reap; no builder would build unless he expected to complete the structure; no man or woman would act unless there existed a faith that the destination would be reached. So, likewise, the commandments of God are obeyed because there exists a faith that certain blessings will follow obedience. Through faith our ancestors accepted the gospel, and by that same faith they left their homes in the Old World and came to a new land feeling sure they would be able to make a better future for themselves and their children, no doubt without fully realizing the many trials that awaited them. This was true of the people who went to the Big Horn Basin in April 1900. They went with faith because the Church Authorities advised it and provided them with a mission. They had great hope in the future of themselves and their children. However, they did not fully realize the trials and hardships that lay ahead.
The great canal took four long years to build and, when completed, it was 37 miles long, 24 feet wide on the bed, 16 feet wide at the bottom. It was built at a cost of $150,000. It
was never bonded, and when completed there was a credit balance of $3,000.
The people who worked on the ditch were given stock with the understanding that their land would cost them $6 per acre. It was later discovered it would cost them $7.50 per acre or $240 for 40 acres. Work had to be discontinued for a short period after the first six months, as there was no money with which to continue. A special fast meeting was held and everyone was asked to fast all day, and to implore the Lord to send some work whereby money could be earned to see the project through. Not many days passed before work was resumed in the following manner: The chief engineer of the Burlington Railroad Company, Mr. S. P. Weeks, came to Elder Woodruff and told him he would like our people to build twenty miles of railroad. He said his company had heard that the Mormons were colonizing in the Basin, so had decided to build a line into the country. This was indeed good news, and contracts were signed for twenty miles of grading. Thus the prayers of the people were answered. While doing this work our people held devotional exercises night and morning, and no job was undertaken without calling upon the Lord for his help.
IT was October of 1900 that mother and the rest of the family joined father and the four children who were with him. The stark had made a camp on what is known as Sage Creek. I was about halfway between the head of the canal and the end of the project. It was here that mother and the family first located. The wind blew constantly in this country and it was a very common thing to see tents tagged-el and household belongings carried away, and what was left would be filled with sand. The water in Sage Creek was very bad and had to be boiled before it could be used. Mother would take the wood ashes and put them into a large barrel which she would have the boys fill with water. The ashes would clarify the water so it was somewhat better for laundering.
While we were living at Sage Creek an epidemic of smallpox broke out. There were no doctors to be had, so my mother, relying upon her own knowledge and wisdom and the help of her Heavenly Father, nursed not only seven members of her own family back to normal health, with no complications or bad after effects, but she aided others who were stricken. It was marvelous how nearly everyone survived this epidemic.
After a few months, father moved us down to the banks of the Shoshone River where the water was better and where there was some shade from the broiling sun. When we would get discouraged, we were reminded of the faith of our grandparents, their trials in crossing the plains and establishing homes in desert country in the early days. Did not Grandfather Taggart leave his wife and two little children at Winter Quarters and go with the Mormon Battalion to Mexico? We were reminded of his bleeding feet, with shoes gone when he arrived in California; of grandmother having to work to support herself and children while he was away. Father would
Church as a boy of seventeen, making three trips across the plains without pay. Boys and men had been asked to volunteer for this work. No, there was no turning back. We had to live up to their example and carry on.
In the late fall of 1901 mother and the younger children moved to the Cowley Flat where the town of Cowley is now located, while father and the older children worked on the railroad. Here the families lived in tents until spring when the men folk began building their homes. That was a terrible winter. Typhoid fever paid the community a visit. Mother nursed the afflicted day and night. Her anxiety for the members of her family who were working on the railroad, especially for the girls who did the cooking for the men, was very great. I shall always know within my own heart that God was watching over us while mother was assisting others, and that because of the faith and prayers might and morning by the whole group, consisting of more than 150 men bearing the holy Priesthood of God, and because of the private supplication of each individual, we were indeed blessed by the Lord and protected from evil.
When the work on the railroad was completed, the men went back to work on the canal, which was completed in 1904. Crops were then planted and home building progressed. All the houses were built of logs. Father built us a very comfortable but humble home which surely seemed like a castle to us at the time. Of course, there were no electric lights, washing machines, irons, heating pads, vacuum cleaners, etc. in these homes. The joy of such things was not known until long afterward. THE BIG HORN BASIN 83 New School LOG HOUSE WHERE FIRST SCHOOL WAS HELD IN COWLEY Coal-oil lamps were used exclusively. (Lanterns were carried at night so one would not get lost on the prairie.) Baths had to be taken in the wash tub, which was no small task for us as we had a large family and water had to be hauled from the river a distance of four miles, and it had to be used sparingly. I am reminded of Alice Morrill's poem "The Pioneer Mother" which is so applicable here: A limitless expanse of wilderness surrounds her cabin home. The sun glares hot and pitiless by day, by night, the weird winds moan. Deep in her heart she makes a grave; lays there her hope of luxury, And gives her life, a ransom for the generations yet to be. In summer, the children went barefoot to save their shoes for winter. Clothing was handed down from one child to another until it was worn"*out. Sewing bees by the women were the social gatherings. At these gatherings or bees, quilts were made, rags were sewn for carpets, and burial clothing was made. There were no undertakers and when death came the women had to take complete charge. During the first few years, my father made all the caskets, and we girls used to help him line and trim them. My father made violins for the boys and guitars for the girls. They were beautifully made with wonderful tone quality. There was always music in our home as we were all blessed with musical talent a talent also possessed by father and mother. Our home was open to all, and there were many happy gatherings there. Young people are pretty much the same in any locality. They like to dance, to play ball, have concerts, shows, etc. This was true of the young people in this settlement. The meeting house, which consisted of one large room with a stage at one end and which was heated by a large stove, was used for all community recreation, such as dancing, shows, basketball, etc. It was rather difficult to get the spirit of worship in the building on Sunday where the night before a heated basketball game had been played.
The people of this pioneer community believed in education. The first schoolhouse consisted of two large rooms built of logs and heated by a large stove. The settlers yearned for higher education in all its phases. In a new country the people have to provide all such things for themselves; and while they may not always provide that which is most satisfying, they meet the needs to a certain extent.
Much trouble was encountered by the people the first time the water was turned into the great canal. The ground was terribly dry (in fact, I don't believe it had had a good soaking since the time of Noah), and much of it was so sandy that it simply could not hold the water; so repair work on the canal had to begin immediately and go on constantly. Senator Mondell stated at one time that the Sidon Canal project would never have been successful except for the rare courage of the Mormon people.
The first year the crops were fairly good, then alkali came upon the land. This was like a plague to the people. Nothing would grow where alkali prevailed. So a drainage system had to be worked out; large trenches were built at great expense to the people who were not prepared to meet such a problem. In time, however, the land was drained and crops were again planted.
When the Government decided to open a road into the eastern part of Yellowstone Park beginning at Cody, Wyoming, our people contracted to build sixteen miles of it. When this road was completed
the people once more. While building this road into the Yellowstone the same procedure was followed as on the railroad work morning and evening devotional exercises were held daily, with Church services on Sunday. Some of the best meetings I have ever attended were held out under the pine trees, and many times God seemed very close to us. One whole summer was spent on the Yellowstone Road project and this road is now the east entrance to Yellowstone Park. Many tourists prefer this entrance. It is very scenic and people are curious to see Buffalo Bill's town of Cody. Buffalo Bill (William F. Cody) was a very interesting character and he was very friendly to our people. He paid them a great tribute. He had secured a permit to irrigate all the land on the north side of the Shoshone River from Eagles Nest to the Big Horn River, but he said, "If the Mormons want to build a canal and irrigate the land lower down the River I will relinquish both land and water to them, for if they say they will do this I know they will; they are the kind of people who do what they agree to do." He did what he said he would do, without compensation, much to the disgust of his partner who wanted $25,000 for the transfer. When the transfer was completed Buffalo Bill said, "Now my dream will be realized for I have wanted to live to see this country developed into a great agricultural region, and the Mormons will fulfill my dream."
Father passed away in August 1924, age 76, and mother six years later, at age 77, leaving a large posterity. Mother was a Relief Society THE BIG HORN BASIN 85  Courtesy Bishop James Harston - COWLEY WARD CHAPEL AND AMUSEMENT HALL, COWLEY, WYOMING of the Cowley Ward Relief Society for eight years. (The desire of their hearts was granted in that they were privileged to live to see the members of their family grow up and establish homes of their own. All the children were married in the Church but one, which, according to the Mormon philosophy of life, is very important. Their descendants love and respect them and appreciate the wonderful influence they have exercised over them.) Father and mother were faithful members of the Church all the days of their lives. Mother's last advice to her children was for them to continue to live the gospel and be faithful and true to God. As I write of my mother, I am thinking of many more wonderful women like her who worked with her for the benefit of the Big Horn community. They were good neighbors and wonderful souls. Many of them are still torch bearers in the Big Horn Basin. THE final chapter of this great country is yet to be written. I have not pretended to write a complete history. Many of those first pioneers have become very prosperous, some became discouraged and left the country, others have comfortable homes and good farms. Some have failed, materially speaking, but have gained spiritually; others have not progressed at all. However, we find these things to be true in every locality. Wonderful highways now connect the various communities, and with the automobile it is now possible to keep in close touch with the outside world. The railroad passes through these communities assuring mail twice each day. The three towns of Lovell, Byron, and Cowley all now have good chapels, school-houses and amusement halls. The Holly Sugar Company built a large sugar factory in Lovell which has been in operation for many years. Lovell, in the year 1900, boasted four families, two of which were bachelors. The 1942 census showed it to have 3,500 souls. There is also a canning factory in Cowley where all (Continued on page 89)
