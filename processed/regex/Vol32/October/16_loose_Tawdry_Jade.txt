TAWDRY JADE Courtney E. Cottam Oh, Autumn is a tawdry jade, Ragged skirts aflutter. Her hair unkempt, and 'round her feet Summer's useless clutter. * She dresses in a tawny red, Gypsy-gay, and bright. Spurning pastel shades of spring And winter's pristine white. Her heart is warm, and through her hands Pours the harvest yield. Garnered by this tawdry jade From fruiting tree and field. Page 605
