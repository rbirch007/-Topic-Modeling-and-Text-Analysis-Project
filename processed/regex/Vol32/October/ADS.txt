Deseret Book Company, $1.50). MIDAS OF AUTUMN Margaret Jenkins I have lived in a beautiful valley; It has blossomed, has glittered with frost, But my greedy eyes love to behold it After "Midas of Autumn" has crossed. Burnished gold are the fields where he passes, Misty gold is the light on the hills. Farmers reckon their bushels in coppers, But it's gold that they haul to the mills! Here the cottonwoods stand like an army He has gilded by brushing the ranks. And the river's a jade-shadowed mirror For reflecting its leaf-jeweled banks. Even dust is a veil of his spinning. He has gilded the humblest door, And my eyes are so filled with the beauty That I never again can be poor.
