WALK DOWN A ROAD IN AUTUMN Anna Prince Redd A special kind of enchantment Steals over the autumn earth; The tang and the taste of autumn Are a fabulous pennyworth. Fields lying warm and yellow Hold wigwams of tasseled corn; The breeze is persuasive and prankish, Apple-spiced as it blows from the thorn. Then a day when the leaves are scattered And the and is a restless sigh, Tuned to the night with a portent The heart cannot deny. But the harvest is warmly cradled Against the coming cold; Oh, spirit, fly South with the swallows. Only the flesh grows old! Walk down a road in autumn Through a flaming sumac lane, Cleanse your soul in its burning. Cool your pulse in its rain. Rejoice in the prodigal sowing. There remain the bud and the root.... Your daughter shall walk in the autumn, Your son shall gather the fruit. The Cover: The cover is from a photograph by T. J. Howells, M. D., "Sunlight on Oat Sheaves."
