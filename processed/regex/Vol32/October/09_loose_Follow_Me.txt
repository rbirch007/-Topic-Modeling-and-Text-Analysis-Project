FOLLOW ME" Rose Thomas Graham As Jesus walked with men along The shores of Galilee, There must have been a little child Who played there by the sea. As Jesus, standing on the Mount, Taught men, whose hearts were stirred, There must have been a little child Who hearkened to his word. As Jesus struggled up the hill Beneath his heavy load, There must have "been a little child Who stumbled on the road. As Marys gathered round the tomb Where their Lord Jesus lay, There must have been a little child Who knelt alone to pray.
