The Relief Society In Church Welfare Elder Marion G. Romney Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles and Assistant Managing Director General Church Welfare Committee 

"FROM the beginning, the women of the Christian Church have shown their surpassing faith and devotion. Only one apostle stood near the Cross while the Christ was crucified, but Mary, the mother, was there, and Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children, and the women that followed Him from Galilee. It was Mary Magdalene who was first at the tomb when the Sabbath had ended, and to her Christ vouchsafed the first view to mortals of His resurrected body.
"From that time until now woman has comforted and nursed the Church. She has borne more than half the burdens, she has made more than half the sacrifices, she has suffered most of the heartaches and sorrows.
"In the modern Church hers has been the abiding, unquestioning faith, the pure knowledge that has enheartened the Priesthood and kept it going forward against all odds. Her loving trust, her loyal devotion were the faithful anchor that held when storms were fiercest." (President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Annual Conference Report, April 1940, p. 21.)
The "women of the Christian Church" include the sisters of the Relief Society, and to no group does this sublime tribute more aptly apply.
One hundred and three years ago, the Prophet "assisted in commencing the organization of the Society." In illustrating its objects, he said that the "sisters might provoke the brethren to good works, in looking to the wants of the poor, searching after objects of charity, and in administering to their wants," (Relief Society Handbook, pp. 21-22). And later in the same month he wrote that its "object is the relief of the poor, the destitute, the widow and the orphan, and for the exercise of all benevolent purposes." He was assured "that with the resources they will have at command, they will fly to the relief of the stranger; they will pour in oil and wine to the wounded heart of the distressed; they will dry up the tears of the orphan and make the widow's heart to rejoice." (D.H.C. Vol. IV, p. 567.)
To guide them in this work, the sisters were to "receive instructions through the order of the Priesthood which God has established, through the medium of those appointed to lead, guide and direct the affairs of the Church in this last dispensation." (D.H.C. Vol. IV, p. 567.)
That the bishop is included in this "order of the Priesthood" is clear from the fact that before the Relief

Society was organized, the Lord had given instructions for the care of the poor of his Church in the revelations received by the Prophet. In these revelations all the powers, functions, and responsibilities necessary for caring for the poor were given to the bishop.
"The Prophet expressed the view that for the sisters to assist in administering to the wants of the poor was one of the best means to the saving of souls, which was the ultimate aim of the Society.
"The century-old record of love-inspired service by the Relief Society is an enduring tribute to its members. Surely the Prophet spoke with prophetic accuracy when he said: 'I now turn the key in your behalf in the name of the Lord, and this Society shall rejoice, and knowledge and intelligence shall flow down from this time henceforth; this is the beginning of better days to the poor and needy, who shall be made to rejoice and pour forth blessings on your heads." (D.H.C., Vol. IV, p. 607) Since March of 1842, in every place where members of the Church have gone, and in all circumstances, the hallowed influence of these women has been actively present. Into countless homes they have gone to take food when hunger threatened; to take clothing and fuel to protect from cold; to nurse in time of illness; to prepare the dead for burial; and to comfort the aching heart. Neither the number of services engaged in nor the amount of time given in them can be set down, for no record has or could have been kept.
"Until recently, the Relief Society visiting teachers in making their monthly visits have gathered charity funds from which aid supplemental to that rendered by the bishop has been administered. In this activity the sisters have rendered a worthy service, resulting in much good and often sorely needed, for in some places there has been little searching after or administering to the poor other than what the Relief Society women have done.
"Under the impetus of the Church Welfare Plan, however, the bishops are more fully discharging the part of their bishop's calling. Into their hands is coming the production of the annual Church Welfare budget, as also increased funds from fast offerings. The Relief Society sisters are therefore relieved from the necessity of maintaining a separate charity account, but their duties toward helping the poor have increased in other ways. This is as it should be, for the Bishop and
