The Shape of Peace Eva Willes Wangsgaard I God of all men and nations, Light in Light, I, who am spent with fear and sorrowing, Ask for a ray to follow through this night Darkened by earthen gods to which men cling. There have been other years when I have seen Your star go down like ice from winter's bough, But never has my heart been caught between, And never was it torn as it is now. So soon we shall be called upon to stem The tides of war and plan for peace to be! That words once lifted over Bethlehem Take definite shape and purpose, we agree; But when the board of diplomats convenes, What shall our blueprint be? And what our means? II The concept of a structure strong enough To hold all men in concord that will last. To bind great powers, long inured to bluff. Into a kindred whole, is a plan so vast As to exceed the limits of the brain. This is a vision only dreamers see, A pact no sage has ever hoped to gain In any form of practicality. We have no precedent on which to build. It well may be that such a scheme may fail-So great the distance from the grandeur willed To grandeur sculptured to a working scale! Yet build we must?another holocaust As mad as this, and man himself is lost. Page 191 III We know you taught us that the structure stands Imbedded in the individual heart, That other temples are but built on sands, The prey of time and wind they fall apart; But words wear thin; their meanings sleep unknown. Unless the heart is willing to concede The world's shortcomings are also its own, No superstructure can fulfill our need. We lack your love immeasurable within; We need your faith in one eternal will For all mankind, before we can begin To plan that tempests lie forever still. Bless those who plan for us. Let them be wise. To shape world peace with brave, world-visioned eyes.

It is a token of healthy and gentle characteristics when women of high thoughts and accomplishments love to sew; especially as they are never more at home with their own hearts than while so occupied. ?Nathaniel Hawthorne Before You Buy a Bible, Be Sure It is the Beloved King James Version It is the authorized version best known, most loved...
