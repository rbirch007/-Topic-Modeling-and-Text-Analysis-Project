Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, May 1 and May 15, 1885. "For the Rights of the Women of Zion, and the Rights of the Women of All Nations" What Can A Woman Do? No doubt many members of the Institute have wondered what vocation in life they should adopt by means of which they could earn their own livelihood, thus promoting self-reliance and the ability to do something sufficiently remunerative to enable them to fight the battle of life single-handed, if necessity required it, or circumstances compelled them to do so. As there is always a possibility that reverses may come to all of us is it not wisdom to give some consideration to this subject? It would be impossible to define just what course any member should follow to become entirely successful; in this matter, as in many others, we must be our own judges. One thing I can say with certainty, and that is this: In making up our minds we should not adopt any kind of labor in the slightest degree degrading. Whatever we try to do, let it be the labor we love; something we can do enthusiastically. People are rarely successful who work mechanically. Some persons have thought, and do so now, that the only labors a woman should perform must be of a domestic character; that to be a household drudge is all she is capable of being; but such persons must be told that at the present time there are hundreds of ladies in the civilized world making themselves famous as authors, physicians, surgeons, public speakers, painters, sculptors and lawyers. The advanced situation of the women of today grants to her all the privileges she may seek to enjoy; and if for any reason she does not choose to marry, there is no law to compel her to do so. This being the case she should know how to take care of herself, and earn her own living...  C. R. S.  A Pleasant Party. Editor Exponent: One of the most enjoyable affairs that ever happened in Deseret came off on the 2d of April in the form of a surprise party in honor of the Prest. Of our Society at the Relief Hall. Sister Eliza Whicker has been president of this society for seven years, and is a noble and well respected sister. The tables were spread with a sumptuous repast and the company seated when our beloved President arrived. After dinner the ceremonies were continued by presenting Sister Whicker with a neatly gotten up and appropriate address in a suitable frame, and several other presents by the sisters, followed by a programme, consisting of speeches, songs and recitations Sister Whicker addressed those present for a short time, thanking the sisters for their kindness; said she prized the address more than gold or silver. A vote of thanks was then returned to the committee for their exertions, and the entertainment closed with singing and prayer. Respectfully, Mary A. Bishop, Secretary. Deseret, Millard Co., April 8, 1885. The exhibition of Decorative Art work at Young Bro's on Main St., which commenced on May 12th, and has been continued since up, to the present, is something wonderful in the way of ornamentation, and requiring less natural ingenuity, it would seem, than embroidery done by hand. Everything, large or small, can be executed on the Domestic machine, on satin, silk, plush, canvas, etc., with chenile, arrasene, crewels, embroidery silk, tinsel, applique, mosaic and etching. Crowds of people were attracted every day to see the handsome and elaborate display of goods, and to watch those who were engaged in running the machines, doing all sorts of fancy ornamental work of different varieties and patterns with the people looking over in wonder and amazement. Surely this is something under the sun. Page 278
