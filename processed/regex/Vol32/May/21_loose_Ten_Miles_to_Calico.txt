Ten Miles to Calico Martha Robeson Wlight PART II THE next morning none of the neighbors showed signs of making a midweek trip to Og-den. The rutted road past the dugout remained empty. At breakfast, her father squinted quizzically at Tilda. 'Figgered how you're goin' to get your wheat to town?" *Tt*s a problem/ she admitted. "But I got to?today." "A squaw would drag it on poles ?a travois." Tilda stared at her father. A shiver of delight rippled over her? not just because his suggestion was practical, but because of what it signified. First he had offered the twine. Now he'd got the answer to her transportation problem. Then her face fell. "I don't know how you make a travois." "I'll show you after breakfast." And as soon as he finished eating, he brought the axe. "We'll fix your drag now, Tildy." While he selected and cut the right size willows, she yanked and slashed off wild grapevines to serve as ropes. When the travois was finished, it had a lashed platform for the wheat and a pair of shafts for Tilda. She cleaned herself up, braided her hair, and put on the hat her mother had woven for her from pond rushes. Ma brought a lunch?two pieces of cornbread and a cucumber?wrapped in a piece of flour sack. Pa carried out the wheat and placed it on the travois platform. Tilda laid her lunch beside the sack. She was dressed in her Sunday homespun, and wore her shoes. "Take your flipper," ma directed. "You might meet something." Tilda laughed, but she stowed the slingshot and a handful of pebbles in her skirt pocket. Pulling the drag along the road, Tilda pretended she was an Indian girl on the way to greet her warrior lover. She threw her hat on the wheat and hung her long braids over her breasts. With her belt and a turkey feather she found, she made an Indian headband. She had just donned it when old Bishop Robinson rode i|p behind her. "Mornin', Gal," he said heartily. He had twinkling eyes. "Good morning. Bishop Robinson." He cocked his gray head to one side. "Let's see. Whose gal you be? I can't place all these children growing up so fast." "I'm Mathilda Dawson." "To be sure. Say, what you got there, Sister Tildy?" "A bushel of wheat I gleaned. I'm taking it to town." "It's a right hot day for dragging. To save you the trip to Ogden I'll give you two dollars for your wheat." Tilda remembered that though the bishop was a righteous worker for the Lord, he had the reputation of being a shrewd trader. Page  "What say, Tildy?" he prompted. "Whose field did you glean?" "Brother Burnett's/' "He grows good wheat. Tell you, I'll make it three dollars." She didn't want to offend Frank's grandfather. She must refuse politely. "Thank you, Bishop, but I got to take this to town." "Why's that?" The old man shifted his weight in the saddle. "I got to buy me some calico dress goods." His wise eyes crinkled at the corners. "Couldn't you buy the goods with the money? Easier than drag-gin' your sack so far." "Calico's dear. Three dollars ain't enough." Would he be mad? He chuckled, "That's the best I can offer. Well?" She shook her head. "Maybe you'll get more." He clucked to his horse. "Giddap." The dust settled on Tilda. She plodded ahead. The heat grew intense and she stopped briefly to remove her shoes. It felt more comfortable to walk barefoot. Did squaws get this tired? After what seemed a very long time, she came to the river. She would have to carry the wheat across. Tilda caught up her skirts and fastened them around her waist with her belt. She pierced the feather through one of her braids. She unloaded the sack on a ledge jutting out from the river bank. Bending her shoulders, she hauled the heavy load onto her back, then walked cautiously into the shallow stream. The rocks on the bottom were slick. Minnows brushed against her legs. It was hard to keep her balance, but she reached the opposite bank and slid the sack to the ground. Tilda drew a long breath. She recrossed the river, got the travois and her shoes and hat, and brought them over, too. Now she'd eat her lunch. "What's that you're so scared o' wettin', little Injun?" A squat, red-headed man stepped from behind a tree. A tall, gray-haired man and a half-breed joined him. They had rifles. Tilda faced them defiantly, though she quaked inside. "I'm no Indian," she said with dignity. "This is wheat. I see you're strangers. If you are on your way to California, you're headed in the wrong direction. You go through Salt Lake." "We done found that out," mumbled the gray-haired man. "Boys, we can use that wheat, eh?" 'An' take a load off the gal's shoulders," laughed Redhead. "It's my wheat!" Tilda crouched desperately over the sack. "You get more," said the half-breed in threatening gutterals. The tall stranger roughly shoved the girl aside and slung the sack over his shoulder. "Run back home or I'll smack you." Lowering her head like a goat, Tilda butted him. He stumbled and the wheat slid to the ground. But Redhead grabbed her arms. "You big bullies!" she sobbed, and kicked her captor's shins. "Ain't you a hellion though!" There was admiration in his tone. "Now, Sis, skedaddle. Else I'll turn you over my knee and paddle you." A hot flood of mixed humiliation and rage engulfed Tilda. They went into the bushes with her wheat. TEN MILES TO CALICO 289 Two weeks of hard work! The tall man spoke to horses, then she heard wagon wheels creak. Tilda gulped her last sob. She wouldn't let them do it! She felt in her pocket for her flipper and pebbles. In a jiffy she put on her shoes. Those men didn't know this country. If she could make them think Indians were after them, they'd whip up their horses and maybe the jolting wagon would bounce the sack overboard. Keeping in the underbrush beside the rutted road, Tilda hurried after them as silently as she could run. She soon caught up to the walking team. Through the bushes she saw a covered wagon. The tall man drove. His companions rode saddle horses, in front and behind. She placed a stone in her slingshot, aimed carefully, and let go. "Damned hornet!" cursed the driver. Blood dripped from his cheek. "No, that warn't a hornet, what was it?" Tilda smiled grimly. In quick succession she fired her second and third shots. The half-breed and Redhead swore in pain. "That must've been a arrow creased me!" howled the driver. The girl started yelling, in imitation of Indian war whoops. She took deep breaths, opened her mouth wide and patted her palm against it. Tilda shot more jagged pebbles, and dodged about in the bushes. She made a great commotion, but stayed hidden. Redhead wheeled his mount beside the driver and shouted, "To save our scalps we gotta leave the wagon! Climb on behind me!" The half-breed was already in panic-stricken flight. The tall man and Redhead fled after him into. The underbrush. This was much more than Tilda had hoped. She ran to the wagon, scrambled to the seat, and started the horses at a brisk trot toward town. She'd deliver her wheat in style. In half an hour she backed up before Horrock's elevated unloading platform. As Tilda wrapped the lines around the brake handle, Frank Robinson came out of the store. Her successful coup against the three thieves made her feel like swaggering a little. She waved casual recognition to Frank so he'd know that he didn't matter any more. "Hello!" she called. He stood staring. Tilda climbed over the seat into the bed of the wagon and tugged her sack of wheat to the low tailgate. She poised there to step off onto the platform. The team moved and she lost her balance. Girl and wheat tumbled to the ground together, landing in thick dust. Her skirts were partly over her head. The old sack burst, and she was half buried in grain. The fall didn't hurt Tilda. Her first thought was of how she must look. She sat up and frantically yanked down her petticoats. She was so mad that she began to bawIl like a roped calf. Several men had seen her mishap. Frank jumped off the store platform and rushed to help her. Tilda was spitting dust and wheat. They were in her mouth and ears and hair, and inside her homespun waist. Her angry tears made mud smears on her cheeks. Since evidently only her feelings were hurt, the picture was too much for Frank and the other onlookers. They all laughed. Tilda stopped crying and glared around. "There's nothing funny, about it! That was nice, clean wheat. Now look at it!" Frank helped her to her feet and broke off his laugh. "No, it wasn't funny, Sister Tilda." With a white handkerchief he awkwardly tried to brush the dust from her face. "Thanks," she said in her stiffest tone. She jerked away. Some grains under her clothes were scratching her. She couldn't get them out with men around. "Mr. Horrocks won't take dirty wheat." I?ll borrow a sieve from him," Frank offered. "The dust'll blow off. I'll get a new sack." He leaped to the platform. Frank Robinson was kind, but he had laughed at her. And again he had seen her looking like all-get-out. So far as he was concerned it was no use to try to make herself appear pretty with a new dress. He'd never forget the sight she had been in Burnett's field, and now here sprawled on the street with her skirts over her head. Served her right for being so vain. Still, she had set out to get that calico, and she would?not to attract Frank, but to keep from being like ma. He came back with a shovel and sieve and a sack. The other men drifted down the street. Tilda and Frank didn't talk while they sieved her wheat and filled the new sack. The breeze blew away the dust. Frank carried the sack into the store. "Mr. Horrocks," he announced, "here is Mathilda Dawson with some wheat." The storekeeper peered over his spectacles at Tilda. "I don't want wheat unless it's prime good. No smut." "I gleaned it from Brother Burnett's field," she said quickly. "Well, I'll take a look." Mr. Horrocks ran the full length of his arm into the sack and pulled up a fistful of kernels. He examined them critically while her heart filled her mouth. "Yes, it's good wheat. Frank, take it back to the bin." Tilda breathed again. "How much will you give me?" "I'm payin' three dollars a bushel to-day." "Why!" she exploded. "Bishop Robinson offered me three. Reckon he'd have taken it to Salt Lake and sold it there for ten dollars." Horrocks looked at her shrewdly. "Can't compete with Salt Lake prices. I admit it's good wheat, but five is the best I'll do." "All right!" she accepted. "I mean five dollars in trade," the storekeeper amended. "All right," Tilda repeated. "And cash money if there's change." "Yes. What do you want. Sister Tilda?" "Calico for a dress. Green. Maybe white vines or leaves in it." "I've got some nice green. Only six bits a yard." The merchant selected a bolt of cloth. The lovely pattern and colors thrilled Tilda. This was worth all her hard work. She fingered the calico and her eyes lifted ecstatically. Then the joy in them died. On the shelf above Mr. Horrock's head stood a silver caster set. Exactly like ma's picture! Tilda couldn't speak. She just stared and pointed. "That?" The storekeeper reached TEN MILES TO CALICO 291 up for the caster. He set it before the girl. "Pretty, ain't it? Took that in trade for some grub. Feller toted it all the way from back East.' 'H?How much d'you want for it?" she forced herself to ask. Again Horrocks peered at her shrewdly. "Well, that's real silver and worth more, but you can have it for five dollars. I don't have much call for such knickknacks." Tilda looked from the silver table-piece to the calico. She must not get like her mother. But if ma had this real caster set! Would it make her feel not so old? "Got something to wrap it in so I won't scratch it carrying it home?" The words were dead sounds that made hollow echoes of the longings she had killed. "Here's the flannel the set was wrapped in," said the merchant. Frank Robinson returned from the rear of the store. "She had 'most half a peck over a bushel, Mr. Horrocks." "You have six bits change coming. Sister Tilda," the storekeeper calculated. "I'll go get it from the money drawer." Slumped in misery, she gazed wistfully at the calico. Frank picked up the bolt. He flipped it round and round to show a length of the goods, then draped the cloth over her shoulder and smoothed it down to hang straight. It covered most of the front of her ugly dress. His rough fingers caught on her braids. "With your yellow hair?," he paused, looking into her eyes. "The green makes you like?like a daffy-dil. Like Spring." Numbly Tilda stared down at herself. At Frank's hand on her shoulder. At Frank. It was like a husband helping put a dress on his wife. His face turned brick red. He licked his lips. "I was terrible forward." His words stumbled. "I meant you'll be so beautiful in it." He wheeled and hurried out of the store. Tilda knew then the uttermost depths of wretchedness. Frank would never see her look like Spring. She'd always be in the dead blacks and rusty browns of a winter tree. Completely lifeless looking. For only a moment she had been transformed to beauty in his sight. Now she was ugly again. Mr. Horrocks brought her change. Her fingers closed listlessly over the two silver coins. She watched him wrap up the caster. She took the bundle in her arms. "I could use more fine wheat like you brought," he remarked. Tilda burst through her numbness as if she had snapped rope bonds. Why, she hadn't half gleaned Brother Burnett's field! She could get another bushel of wheat as easily as the first! "Here!" Tilda thrust the coins into the storekeeper's hand. "I'll be back with just as good a sackful. Take this money as part payment for six yards of that calico. The green! Be sure to save it for me. Promise!" she demanded. He chuckled, "It's a bargain. Sister Tilda." "T'll bring the wheat in two weeks," she said. Tilda wanted to dance on the road home, but she had to be careful of the caster set. How ma's eyes would pop! Pa's, too. Tilda did a few cautious hop-skips, and sang, (Concluded on page 319)
