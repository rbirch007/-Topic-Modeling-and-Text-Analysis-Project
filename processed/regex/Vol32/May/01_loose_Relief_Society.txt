VOL. 32, NO. 5 MAY 1945 MOTHER'S DAY-1945 Etta S. Robbins The sun looks down upon a world of strife That avarice and hate have brought about. The teachings of our Lord, who gave us life, From hearts of countless men are blotted out. The earth is reeking with the stench of war In air, on sea and land the din and fray Resound through waves of ether near and far, And mar the happiness of Mother's Day. Though muted grief, too deep for words or tears. Close tight the lips and bow the heads in prayer. The mothers of the land shall conquer fears. Their faith and courage shield from dire despair. Their all-enduring love touch hearts of men And help the balm of peace to flow again. The Cover: The cover "Peonies in May" is from a photograph by Thomas J. Howells, M. D. BELLE SMITH SPAFFORD
