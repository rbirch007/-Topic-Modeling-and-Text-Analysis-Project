FULFILLMENT
Mabel Jones Gabbott
The young bride dreamed of years ahead, All shining bright with lofty deeds, With this accomplishment and that She planned to meet the world's great needs.
The years came on with toil and pain, No great achievement came her way; Her life was filled with humble tasks, She met and wisely lived each day.
She swept and baked and sewed and sang; In holy partnership with God She brought a boy into the world And taught him rev'rence for the sod.
The mother, crowned with silvery hair, Looked back content when life was done. What greater gift could help the world Than this a fine and noble son?
