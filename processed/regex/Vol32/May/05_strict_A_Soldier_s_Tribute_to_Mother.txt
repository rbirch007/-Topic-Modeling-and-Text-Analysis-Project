A SOLDIER'S TRIBUTE TO MOTHER May H. Marsh They tell me, Mother dear, that when you bore me, For days and nights so near death's door you lay. You passed, dear, through the valley of the shadow, And no price seemed too great for you to pay. All through my baby days you watched and nurtured. And with your help I learned your name to lisp. When e'er I stumbled you were there to help me. My childish hurts were healed with just a kiss. I had such faith in you, my angel Mother, And it was you who taught me faith in God, That he would guide my steps if I but trusted. And give me strength the dangerous paths to trod. Those baby days and years have all passed, Mother, The boy you watched has now to manhood grown. The call has come to join the world's great conflicts. And fight for you and liberty and home. If I am called to pass through that same valley, That your life might be happier and free. May God make me, like you, brave and triumphant. To pay, in part, your sacrifice for me.
