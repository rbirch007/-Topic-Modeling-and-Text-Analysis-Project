THE WAYS OF HER HOUSEHOLD" Prov. 31:27 Delia Adams Leitner "She looks well to the ways of her household," How often in days fraught with care These words have brought to me comfort And helped me to cheerfully bear The demands and the duties so endless. Interruptions and problems to meet. Exactions in "ways of the household," And each day of the year they repeat. But I, with all true-hearted mothers.
