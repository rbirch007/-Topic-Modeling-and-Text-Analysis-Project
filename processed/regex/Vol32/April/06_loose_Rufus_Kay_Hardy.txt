Rufus Kay Hardy President Levi Edgar Young Of the First Council of the Seventy ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY (Died March 7, 1945) ALL who knew him have praised his goodness, his kindliness, as much as they have his love for right. Bearing testimony of the truth of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was his great passion. Called as he was to go to the South Sea Islands to give the gospel to the Polynesian people, he not only spent one period of his youth among them, but three times was he called by the Church to go to that people. That which made the people understand the light and beauty of his message was the manner in which it was put forth. In their traditions we find their ancestors believing in God the Creator of heaven and earth, and Page 200 man created in the image of God. They knew of the Redeemer of the world and deeply did President Hardy know that some day, the people of those islands of the sea would come to a knowledge of the restored gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. For over a decade he served as a member of the First Council of the Seventy, a position he dignified and to which he gave all honor. He had a fine idea of accuracy and a desire for the exact truth, which grudged no time and pains in tracing out even what might mean a small matter. He had a sound and calm judgment which subjected his own and all people's inferences to a searching review. With these fine characteristics, he threw the whole force of his nature into the work of the Seventy of the Church. The dignity of the work was in keeping with its importance. The missionary system is a means to an end; and every seventy, a missionary, should bring his soul to the desire to go forth and "preach the gospel to all peoples of the earth." He wanted the seventies to become students and teachers, but ever given to the deep knowledge that each one by the grace of God has that eternal testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God to usher in the new age of the gospel of salvation. So he lived and died, knowing that the forces which are to make the world the world it ought to be are now within it.
