Come in for Dessert Edna K. Ward THE homemaker today who must be hostess, cook, and maid is discovering many short cuts. Elaborate entertaining, and many-course, complicated meals went out with whipped cream and two-inch-thick steaks. Entertaining at all might require justification with so many homemakers working in war industries, busy in Red Cross canteens and sewing centers, serving as nurses' aids, and Gray Ladies. Returning home worn from the work of thee day, it requires courage to undertake the entertainment of our friends, and yet it is in times of stress that the companionship of the friends we see so seldom gives a lift to their morale and also to our own. If we can find a way to extend this courtesy with simplicity, consistent with rationing restrictions, we may foster the place of the home in the lives of our children and our friends. The trend of modern life in America has seemed to be away from the home and home interests. A dinner downtown or at some club, lunches and snacks at the drugstore for children as well as adults, has made the home mean less in the lives of many than it did in pioneer days. Home influence has decreased in direct proportion. No one has time for elaborate meals these days, but any meal should be worthy of the time you do give it. Badly planned meals are neither fun to prepare nor to eat; the food that appears daily on your table has to be Page 220 prepared by someone?and that someone must like what she is doing or the result will be far from satisfactory. For cooking is a peculiar occupation; to succeed, it must combine the best of both work and hobby. Only when cooking is viewed and approached as an art, which it is, is the burdensome repetition of the task turned into a self-gratifying performance. If you give it your heart and mind it can be as satisfying as painting pictures. Colorful china, linen, flowers from your garden are your "brushes and oils." With them you can create a background that makes even the simplest meal more glamorous. Foods in themselves have their own natural beauty. It's mixing them up?the reds, greens, yellows and whites? that gives your meals the most appetizing effect. Though the first impression of the dining table is only momentary, like a landscape just before sunset, the real fun is in creating it, and that will last until you create another. And there's more involved in it than just the "looks." Digestion depends upon the psychological reaction to our senses. Food that is well cooked and nicely served creates a healthful response in the attitude of the mind toward food. Emotional disturbances, fear, anger, anxiety, unrest banish appetite and stop the flow of the digestive juices. Happy influences, harmony, and beauty stimulate and promote these vital functions. COME IN FOR DESSERT TABLE SET FOR DESSERT And so in these busy times let's make home meals and company meals as simple and nutritious and beautiful as possible. To simplify home entertaining even more, it is possible to substitute a single course ?invite your friends for dessert. This touch of hospitality may be the occasion for a pleasant evening at home. It is hoped the suggestions given in this article may call forth original ideas that will be practical in the individual home. In planning an evening dessert, the invitation can be extended on short notice. A call on the telephone in the morning with the explanation that you are serving only dessert, and arranging an hour convenient to both hostess and guest, makes the occasion informal. The hour may be seven-thirty or eight o'clock. The planning must include the table setting and the menu, and perhaps the entertainment to follow. A small table may be set for four in the living room or the dining-room table may be used for a larger group. This is an invitation to use our choice pieces of china and silver ?the lovely compotes that mother prized or the chocolate pot that father brought from England or Germany when he returned from his mission. The table cover may be doilies or a luncheon cloth. The table mirror makes an attractive foundation for the display of a low centerpiece of ivy, leaf, berry, fruit or blossoms, each in season. Candles always add soft light to any evening meal. The service should be your nicest dessert plates or crystal sherbets with dessert spoons and forks. If hot chocolate or postum is used, the hostess may serve it at the table in either tea cups or after-dinner cups. The dessert also may be served by the host or hostess at the table. If one does not have help, to have everything on the table eliminates the confusion of someone leaving to bring things from the kitchen. Salted nuts are easily prepared at home and can be included, and homemade candy will always be appreciated. A few suggestive menus and recipes are given at the end of this article. A FTER lingering in the candle-light with good food and interesting conversation, the party may move to the living room and its cheery fire, or to the summer terrace. A planned evening might include discussion of current events, of civic problems or neighborhood projects, a book review, a report on a current magazine. Too often magazines in the home are read by only one member and the contents are unread by the others. Much valuable and interesting material is appearing in the better magazines today. If one or more of those present would undertake the review of some article of interest, it would be a stimulus to his own development and of interest to all. For those who like music, an evening of singing around the piano can be delightful, as can also be an evening spent in listening to recorded symphonies. If a guest is known to have a hobby, he may like to demonstrate it or discuss it, and games always make an evening enjoyable. In these changing times should thought not be given to the preservation of the home and the reestablishment of its place in the lives of both children and adults? Practically all entertainment was provided by the members of the family in former times, with a resultant development of those taking part. Such growth is not promoted by sitting in a darkened movie under the emotional drive of scene and symbol in a world of unreality. Whatever one can do to add to the meaning of the home will be helpful in maintaining the kind of citizenship that has e made America strong. Every mother who gives thought and care and effort to the creation of an interesting and cultured home, adds a touch of sweetness and enrichment to the lives of all who spend an hour within its walls. Home is a woman's rightful throne. Suggestions For a spring evening use a bowl of violets with yellow doilies or tablecloth, and have a tiny violet corsage on each napkin (for the men, too).
