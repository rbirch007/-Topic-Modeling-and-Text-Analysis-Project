Utah Shall Blossom Abundantly Elder Irvin T. Nelson Supervisor of Landscaping on Temple Square... The desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, And rejoice even with joy and singing (Isaiah 35:1-2), THE State of Utah, on her Centennial eve, should be ready to blossom, yes, to blossom abundantly. Let there be trees and lawns, shrubs and flowers. Let the whole State blossom as our planting dictates, as the rose, as the lilac, as the peony, as the lilies and poppies of the field. Remember this, however, unless we plant, there can be no blossoming. To this end, each person who loves his State should show that love by planting something to clothe her in beauty. Before blossoming can come, there must first be plowing and planting, hoeing and watering. Even before a sod is turned, there must be the mind's vision of what is to come. There must be patience, too oh, the long years of waiting before some flowers bloom! Our pioneer forebears showed us the way, with patience, with vision, with labor. The standards set by them are worthy ones for us today. They were fired by the injunction of their Prophet given in the stress and suffering of Jackson County, Missouri: "Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness. Yea, verily, I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments." Through all the hardships of the pioneers, there crystallized one yearning, a home again, in security, where they could worship as they pleased. In Nauvoo, they showed how they could make even a swamp blossom with real homes. But for many of the pioneers, as they trudged the weary miles to Salt Lake Valley, or waited at Winter Quarters, or in a foreign land, there was only patience and work and looking forward to the blossoming that was to come when they reached the Valley. And many of them went down into Death's Valley, instead of on to Zion. They died holding fast to a dream of homes, safe from enemies, and, in due time, the peace of shade trees and the joy of roses. But those dreams were not buried on the plains. Those who were permitted to come to the Valley worked with an added zeal, because of the true souls who had given their all, and it was not long before real homes began to blossom 'in the valleys. Stubborn soil was cultivated and made to produce food and clothing were urgent necessities. But not by bread alone did they live. Their homes held safe the treasures of the spirit. Beauty, as well as utility, was in their gardens. In those covered wagons were carried not only fruit trees and corn for the planting, but also rose bushes and geranium slips. With their own hands the pioneer built homes and filled them with handiwork and, seeing the State must be organized. Plans their work was good, then came the must be made. Page  UTAH STATE CAPITOL them with handiwork and, seeing their work was good, then came the joy and the singing. Now is the time for us to show that we appreciate our heritage and our desire to pass it on. As war conditions improve, cities, counties, and the State must be organized. Plans must be made. Work must proceed. As individuals we should not say,  I wish I could hire someone to make me a beautiful garden.  Do it with your own hands and there will be the joy and the singing. JULY Courtney E.
