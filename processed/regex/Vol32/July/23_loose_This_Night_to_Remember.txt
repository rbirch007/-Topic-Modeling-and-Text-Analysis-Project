This Night to Remember Christie Lund Coles HE didn't say anything . . . he didn't need to. At the touch of his hand, she stood up and fitted into the curve of his arm while her hand slipped slowly up the shoulder of his dark coat. Their bodies moved together with the effortless grace of water.
The sky, through the high gymnasium window, was lighted by a full moon over which clouds moved like wind-blown thistle. A trumpet trio had stepped to the front of the stage and was harmonizing an old waltz. The lights were dim and these young people who had never learned to waltz, moved slowly, shuffling their feet, stardust in their eyes.
Boys in uniforms with girls clinging to their arms stepped through the side doors into the night. But Felice and Chad continued dancing silently, easily, as if there were no time, no future, only the rhythmic moments.
But when the tune was ended they moved to join several other boys and girls. One of the boys said, "Say, maybe we're lucky to be in engineering. For the time, at least, tonight is just another night to us. But to these other kids it's the last for a long time. They're trying to cram a lifetime into a few hours."
"How right," Chad agreed, easily, gaily, though Felice thought she saw the flesh darken above his white collar. He turned to her rather quickly and his arm tensed. "Are we five?"
She nodded, smiling into his brown eyes, and they moved toward the open door.
ONCE outside, their feet seemed automatically to go toward the south lawn of the campus where the maples in their riotous colors formed a parasol of lace over their heads, where the oaks and the silver birch stood quivering against the sky. They walked slowly, unhurried ly as they had done on many nights before, their hands clasped lightly together, a silence?deep and understanding?between them.
Finally, she said, "The boys look cute in their uniforms, don't they Chad?"
"Fine," he agreed, then clearing his throat, "It will seem strange around here with so many of them gone."
As they walked they saw couples in various places, a boy and a girl sitting close, talking in fast, incoherent sentences, trying to say things that would bridge the time until they met again.
Felice repeated, "Trying to cram a lifetime into a few hours. How can they know which are the important things to say? How could one choose?"
"Yes, how?" he repeated, steering her to the left until he brought her to a birch tree where they paused. "Remember?" he asked quietly, running his hand over the bark that had been cut with a sharp knife to form their initials. "Weren't we silly? Page  Each trying to out-talk the other, both afraid we would never have another chance to say the things we felt." "I suppose that's how it is with them tonight. They are afraid... And well they might be." "Would you be afraid?" he asked, leaning his tall length against the tree, looking down at her, a quizzical smile upon his lean features. "Perhaps. I don't really know." "What was it you said that first night, "Love isn't a part of time.' " "Oh, that. I said, 'Love has nothing to do with time or space or age.' I must have read it someplace. And sophomores are so wise." He laughed shortly, "And not wise at all when we are seniors. Who was it said that when he graduated from high school he knew it all but when he finished college he realized how much there was that he didn't know." "I wonder if anyone ever feels that he knows a whole lot?" she asked, her narrow forehead wrinkled becomingly. "I'm sure I don't. And I doubt if anyone does in these times. But let's talk about us." "There'll be plenty of time for that. In fact, there has been some little time spent on the subject... Or don't you remember?" "Sure do, lady," he assured her. "But I'm just checking to be sure I remember rightly. Are you still taking good care of that frat pin I gave you? Does it mean as much as it did before?" She looked surprised, "Why, of course, Chad." He took her hands in his, "Does it still make you dizzy when you think about me?" "But, sir, spare my blushes. Don't hold everything I say against me." There was laughter in the brown eyes she lifted to his and her wide, young mouth was parted softly. Suddenly, he pulled her to him and kissed her slowly, gently, then harder, hungrily, as though to solace a deep hurt or a dark fear. She drew back, "Now, what good would thinking about you do, after that." He tweaked her ear, laughing gently, "Come on, Twerp, if we hurry we can see Orion." "Really. Isn't it funny you've been saying that every week for over two years and it still gives me the same thrill. Seeing those stars sort of puts us in our place." LATER, when they came out of the observatory building, they paused to let the wind brush cooling fingers through their hair. They looked down over the sleeping college town, the beloved campus, the blue hills to the west. She sighed, "Another Friday night... Just like the others, yet somehow different. And now home." "Just one more thing," he whispered, huskily, laying his hand on her silken hair, "I love you." "And I love you, Chad. Lots." "I've got to tell you," he began swiftly, "I'm going, too. I'm going with the others tomorrow. I enlisted. I should have told you but I wanted tonight to be just as the other nights had been. As long as you didn't know, it was okay. But... But, if you had known I would have been tempted to ask you to run away from the crowd tonight, to ask you to marry me . . . or something."
His words had followed on one another so quickly that her choked, "Oh, Chad," had been lost in the web of them. Now, he stopped, holding her by the shoulders with his hands, looking intently into her eyes.
Her voice caught in her throat as she asked, "Could you have treasured anything more . . . than . . . tonight?"
He lifted her chin in his hand, shook his head. "No, Twerp. I'm sure of one thing, lifetimes can't be lived in that. It's like running backwards . . . you never quite catch
up with yourself. I'll know you are here, waiting. That's enough."
"And I'll know, I'll know every minute, Chad, that you'll be coming back. Tonight will be doubly precious because it was just like other nights."
They looked long at one another, kissed. When he let her go, she said, "There's just one more thing, Chad, . . . Your sister told me this morning that you were leaving."
He gave a short laugh before he whispered, "You did joke!"
Then his fingers curled hard about hers, they started down the hill, a silence?deep and understanding?between them.
