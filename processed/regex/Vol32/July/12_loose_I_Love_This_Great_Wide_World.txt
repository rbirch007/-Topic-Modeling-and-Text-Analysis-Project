I love this great, wide world of ours; The winter snows and summer showers. I love the glowing noonday sun, The peaceful calm when day is done. I love the stars, all shining bright To guide the traveler through the night. I love the ocean deep and wide, The endless rise and fall of tide. And the ships that sail the restless sea Great fascination hold for me. As they wind their way to foreign port Laden with cargo of every sort. I love this great, wide world of ours, The gloomy days, the sunny hours. I love the mountain's majesty, The rivers rushing toward the sea. And Iam sure that mere man Could not improve upon God's plan.
