Two Faith-Promoting Incidents. Annie G. Laiiritzen OBEYING THE PROMPTINGS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BRINGS BLESSING. 'Twas as if to impress upon my mind the great lesson of obedience and faith as well as to show me the arm on which I must lean in all future years that I had the following remarkable experience in my early married life. My first child was a little over one year old when she was taken with dysentery. For a time I doctored her with castoria, rhubarb, castor oil/ and many different, well-known household remedies, but although I received many testimonies of healing in my childhood and youth, it.seemed now that I was too stupid to think of exercising any faith in her behalf; so she grew worse and worse, and although I worried myself nearly to death, I entirely forgot to call directly upon our dear, good Lord. One day a neighbor told me that she had heard of putting cold water cloths on the stomach to draw out inflammation, which I promptly tried with most disastrous results. The child was already weak and faint with the bloody discharge from the bowels, and as I placed the cold application to her stomach she suddenly went cold and numb, apparently lifeless; her eyes were closed as if in death. I was just within a few weeks of my second confinement and was alone, as I thought, with a dead child and a little girl Martha Zoolig. She ran out for help while I held the child, screaming meanwhile, "O, I've killed her, I've killed her, I've killed my darling babe." Then I grew more rational as i heard the still small voice within me saying, as if in reply to my words: "No, you haven't killed her, you've done all you could with earthly means, now try to call upon the Lord! Rub her stomach with the consecrated oil and thend pray!" I did as directed, and she soon revived, to my unbounde joy; recovering rapidly she steadily grew in health and strength. She is now nearly 28 years of age and has four lovely children that of her own. Since then I've had hundreds of testimoni es, but was the greatest of all and the very best one. ON YIELDING OUR WILL TO GOD. The doctor had said, "I can give you no hope that she will live." I need not tell you how I felt you have all seen loved ones pass away. 154 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Yes, this was an idolized child and I felt as if I should go raving mad. I had no power to reason; all I could do was to run back and forth wringing" my hands and moaning piteously. The hour was midnight. I frantically handed the child to my husband and ran out of the door. I gazed round at the peaceful, silent stars that seemed to whisper to my distracted soul that God was taking our darling for a purpose, known best to Him  a certain mission, the nature of which I will not here disclose. In answer to my anguished pleadings the Father revealed to me, by the still small whisperings of His Holy Spirit what it was to be: and so returning to the house and throwing my arms about the neck of my dear sister I said in a calm and rational, almost firm voice, "Father, thy will be done, not mine; not mine, but thine." And then and there came stealing into my heart the pure, whitewinged dove of peace, and a joy came into my soul that I cannot express. It was as if the home was filled suddenly with a concourse of angels. I never felt any happier in my life, for the Lord had,sent his Holy Spirit to comfort my distracted soul. This Holy presence can supply the loss of loved ones and make the future years of absence seem as a fleeting moment. Almost twenty years had passed with their train of joys and sorrows  and I was seated in the St. George temple, clothed in the robes of that holy house, when the following poem came into my mind and I ran upstairs and wrote it down: "thy will, o lord, not mine be done." "Thy will, O Lord, not mine be done," So spake the Lord in agony, While in that dark and deep despair, Alone in drear Gethsemane, Repeated o'er upon the cross Of cruel bleak Mount Calvary. Come unto me, thou gift divine. Of faith in God, that I may see The wisdom of the Father's love. Who loves while yet he chastens me, That understanding him while here Prepares me for eternity. O give me light thy will to know, O give me strength thy will to do, . That I may merit here below Thine approbation pure and true. That I may rise from living death. To walk in life forever new. TWO FAITH-PROMOTING INCIDENTS. 155 Thy loving care is infinite, Extended to us every one; Oh help us each to understand And ne'er thy godly wisdom shun; There'll be no fear nor sorrow when We learn to say, "Thy will be done." BOOK ON HYGIENE. Personal Hygiene and Home Nursing, a Practical Text for Girls and Women for Home and School Use, by Louisa C. Lippitt, R. N..

Published by World Book Companly, Yonkers-on-Hudson, New York. The purpose of Miss Lippitt's textbook is to explain the means by which girls and women may attain health and happiness in the present, and lay the foundations for sane and vigorous lives in after years. In clearest terms it lays down practical instructions for the conduct of their daily lives. Not only are the rules set out, but the reasons which underlie them are made clear. Directions are given for preventing the spread of infection from cases of communicable disease; and instructions furnished for the care of oneself and one's family in cases of accident sickness. TO GENEALOGICAL STUDENTS AND THE SISTERS GENERALLY. Some people who have printed books containing genealogical records, take names from the books merely placing checks against the names and perhaps penciling dates. This will inevitably lead to confusion and will be an expensive los.s, in the future, to the family genealogist, as duplications are bound to occur. We suggest to all those who have printed books, that this winter, when our meetings are adjourned, such owners of books could profitably spend a portion of the Sabbath day in copying all printed information, first into note books and then into proper family records for temple use. Note sheets should be drawn off from printed books or penciled note books. All should be copied properly, first into pencil note books, and then in ink into the family temple record; and then sheets may be drawn off from that temple record. Thus the family relations are established, and sealings and adoptions will follow naturally and clearly. Sisters, have you a printed family book? If so, take this advice from a friend. At the
