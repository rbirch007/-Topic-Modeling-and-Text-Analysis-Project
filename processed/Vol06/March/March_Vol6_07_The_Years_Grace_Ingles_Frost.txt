The Years Grace Ingles Frost
======================================================================

Years. By Grace Ingles Frost. My soul tonight goes groping through the years, The years that mark the way which forms the past, With mingling of its laughter, love and tears, Its sunshine which was merged in shade at last. Forth from its quest my soul grown strong returns From conflict with the bygone years, to find With sympathy and love more brightly burns Its altar-fires for struggling human kind. O years long past, O years that yet must be, And you, today, that link which lies between, Which maketh of the past and future one, Ye are but stepping-stones 'twixt heaven and me
