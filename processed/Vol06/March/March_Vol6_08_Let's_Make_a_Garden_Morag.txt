Let's Make a Garden By Morag. "For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over. "The flowers appear on the earth, the time of singing of birds is come" (Song of Solomon). To grow flowers successfully one thing above all others is necessary, that is plain, ordinary common sense. It is a pretty fancy to say that flowers will grow for those who love them  one might as well say that good bread or preserves are the products of affection rather than of skill. As in everything else, there is a certain knack in growing flowers. The closer you study nature, the better gardener you will become. Use the head and hands as well as the heart. Study the various classes of flowers and their habits. "Annuals," as the name implies, are plants of a year. Born in the spring, they bloom and seed in the summer and die with the frosts of autumn. Among the more familiar annuals are asters, stock, marigolds, mignonette, sweetpeas, cosmos, larkspur, petunias, nasturtiums, centaurea, and many others. Biennials, among which are canterbury bells, snapdragons, sweet Williams, hollyhock and forget-me-not, bloom in their second summer, then seed and die; hence the need of sowing some seed each year, that flowers for the following season may be assured. If you want a garden that will bloom for you year after year, you must plant a goodly assortment of perennials. These may be grown from seeds sown in early summer, from slips or cuttings from root or stem, or by root divisions, which should be made after the flowering season is over, or in early spring when danger of frost is over. Some of the best perennials are chrysanthemums, bleeding heart, delphiniums, coreopsis, peonies, Gaillardia, shasta daisies, poppies, primrose, phlox, and a variety of other old favorites. Then the glorious array of bulbous rooted flowers, from the tiny snowdrop, all through the narcissi family, the tulips, hyacinths and other spring beauties, lilies in all their varieties, gladiolus, dahlias, cannas, etc. Next the roses, climbing, bush and standard, the deciduous shrubs, lilacs, syringas, snowball, altheas; and the vines which LET'S MAKE A GARDEN. 161 so quickly change an old building into a bower of beauty, the morning glories, gourds, wild cucumber, beans, etc. Their number is legion and there are flowers suited to almost every kind of climate and condition. It is not luck with flowers that counts, it is intelligent labor, Study the flower catalogues, which usually contain much comprehensive instructions. Learn the variety of plants that require full sun and those which grow better in shady nooks, so that you will not plant sunflowers six inches apart on the shady side of your house and violets two feet apart in the blazing sunshine. See that your garden plot is deeply plowed or dug and well fertilized. Avoid attempting too many varieties at first. Begin with a few of the well known hardy plants, and when your toil is rewarded with an array of loveliness, share your flowers with your less fortunate neighbors. Save your seeds and exchange with your friends. Profit by their and your own experience, for as in all other good things of life, "Of all the joys of gardening, sharing is the best." THE MARCH GARDEN CALENDAR. Plow or spade the garden as soon as the soil is dry enough and dig in some fertilizer. Plant peas, lettuce and spinach as soon as the ground can be worked. Rake off the asparagus bed and dress with bone meal or fertilizer. Place a headless barrel or tub over the rhubarb plants and throw fresh manure around, if you want some early pie-plant. Prune all the dead wood from the rose bushes and climbing roses. (Wear gloves) Sharpen garden tools. Order seeds, tools and garden supplies. Plant sweet peas. Make a trench about six inches deep in rich, mellow soil, and plant the seed thinly in the bottom. Cover with finely sifted soil and a little well rotted manure. When the seedlings are about five inches high, fill up trench and furnish some support for the vines. Brush or chicken wire makes a good support. Water freely; cultivate or hoe often. Lawn clippings make a good mulch during the hotter months. Pick flowers daily. Do not allow seeds to form or flowers will stop blooming.
