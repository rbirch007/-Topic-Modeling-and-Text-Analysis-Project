On the Watch Tower James H. Anderson
======================================================================

WATCH TOWER James H. Anderson Berlin, Vienna and Petrograd all were scenes of fighting in January, with a long list of casualties. Ex-Kaiser Wilhelm II probably will be tried for capital offenses, the court to be selected from neutral nations. Territorial claims of the Entente allies occasioned considerable dispute at the peace conference in Paris, in January. Prohibition is now a part of the United States Constitution, and goes into effect thereunder on January 16, 1920. Palestine, as well as Mesopotamia and Arabia, probably will have a government of its own, under modified British protection. German radicals were defeated in the elections in Germany in January, the majority Socialists being the chiefly successful political party. The 145th light field artillery, known as "the Utah regiment" of the U. S. army, was mustered out of service at Logan, Utah, January 21 to 24. An Irish Republic was proclaimed in January, and British troops were demanded to be removed from Ireland. There was no such moving. Peace is receiving earnest and urgent discussion at the conference in Paris; civil war prevailing in Russia, Germany and Austria, meanwhile. Germany continues actively at war, notwithstanding the armistice; this is required because of the attacks of Polish and Bolshevik armies on Germany's eastern borders. Numbers of English girls have become wives of American 174 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. soldiers in Europe; and numbers of English girls are married to Americans in this country. Portugal joined with the Entente Allies in the "fight for democracy," and in January proceeded with a possibly successful revolution to restore the monarchy in that nation. Bolshevik troops were defeated by the allied troops in northern Russia in the early part of January, but were victorious over the allies in a battle in the latter part of January. Melvin J. Ballard, made a member of the Council of Apostles in January, has been an able and humble teacher of righteousness from his youth. He is a native of Logan, Utah. Extended government control of railroads in the United States met with such general opposition in January that it would seem the people already have had enough of the experiment. Industrial disturbances, in the way of serious strikes, caused much uneasiness in England, Scotland, Ireland, the Argentine Republic, parts of the United States, and other places, in January. Ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, than whom the people of Utah and other Rocky Mountain States never had a better friend in the White House, died at his home at Oyster Bay on January 6. Injustice in army trials and methods received considerable airing in the United States in January, and the movement for reform therein gains impetus as soldiers are being demobilized and permitted to reveal true conditions. Women took part in the discussions of the Republican national committee in the United States, in January, for the first time in history. One woman represented New York on the Atlantic coast and another Washington on the Pacific coast. Unionizing schoolteachers for higher wages is being attempted in Utah. Already the demand of the profession for more money and greater power of supervision over the youth make it look like a combination to "get power and gain." Church services among the Latter-day Saints in the intermountain region were suspended after the October conference, except on the first Sundays in January and February, until the ON THE WATCH TOWER. 175 second Sunday in the latter month, when they were resumed, the epidemic of influenza having abated considerably. The workmen's and soldiers' government in Russia has decided to furnish husbands to all unmarried women there between the ages of 18 and 45 years, and to have the state take control of the children of such relationships. Ugh! Another war within fifty years, is the warning sent to Americans unless Germany is permanently crippled by the peace conference. The likelihood of another war within that time is by no means uncertain, but not on the same lines of cleavage as that now closing. The ninety-first division of the United States army, still in France, composed of men from the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast States, saw some of the hardest fighting of the war, has in it more "Mormons" than has any other army division, and includes the 362nd Infantry, which has a larger membership of "Mormons" than any other regiment in the division, and also shows a larger casualty list than any other of those regiments. Germany has been deservedly censured for its destructive vandalism in France during the war. In Barnes' General History, telling of the war of the Second Coalition, 1688-1697, this is what is recorded of the armies of France when these were in the German territory between the rivers Moselle and Rhine, now occupied by American and French troops: "The French army, unable to hold its conquests, destroyed over forty cities and villages. Houses were blown up; vineyards and orchards were cut down. Palaces, churches and universities shared a common fate. Even the cemeteries were profaned, and the ashes of the dead scattered to the winds. A cry of execration went up from the civilized world." War still is war. American women have something to think of in Mile. Yvonne Galli's publicly given reasons for saying, in January, that probably 250,000 American soldiers in France will marry French wives; here they are: "Our girls are perhaps not as clever as yours, but they are more lovable, more appealing to the heart of a brave, good man. Here is the difference: The French girl follows her husband; the American girl wants to lead him. The French girl is happy in doing for the one she loves; the American girl demands he serve her. French wives are helpmeets to their husbands; not their slave drivers. French daughters obey their parents; do not dictate to them. French mothers are teachers of their children, not their servants."
