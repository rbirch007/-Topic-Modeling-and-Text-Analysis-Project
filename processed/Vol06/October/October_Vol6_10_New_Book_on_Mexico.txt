New Book on Mexico
======================================================================

NEW BOOK ON MEXICO. A new book full of excellent material concerning conditions in Mexico reached this office. The title is Mexico Under Carranza. The author is Thomas E. Gibbon. Price $1.50. It can be purchased at the Deseret News Book Store. Mr. Gibbon has spent much time in Mexico, studying its people and its industries under the governments of Diaz, Madero, and Carranza. Being a lawyer accustomed to producing proofs that will stand the test before judge and jury, he has prepared his case against the Carranza government with the same thoroughness that he would follow if he were presenting it before a supreme court. Without the slightest attempt to dramatize the facts, but with a logic that absolutely convinces, Mr. Gibbon makes clear the situation. One reads with growing anger the arraignment of the ruthless cruel government below the border. "Here's an inkling of the cause of the failure of the Pershing Expedition. Mexico is our next big problem — this book will be of real service in solving it." Apostle Anthony W. Ivins, who understands conditions in Mexico pretty thoroughly, has read this book with interest. He feels, however, that as the author himself says, it is an indictment of Carranza rather than an open-minded statement of the case in full. The great body of the Mexican people are peace-loving and simple-minded. They are exploited by politicians in much the same way that our Indians used to be in this government, while much of the disorder and outlawry in that country is carried on by the same element that creates mob rule in the south of the United States, and which makes confusion and brings bloodshed in this country or any other. Mexico certainly needs more education, better opportunities, and above all honest politicians. Where, however, are the latter to be obtained?
