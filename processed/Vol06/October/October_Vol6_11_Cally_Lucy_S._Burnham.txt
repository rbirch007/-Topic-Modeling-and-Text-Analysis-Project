======================================================================

Cally. By Lucy S. Burnham. Cally, dear little friend of long ago, if you are living and should chance to read these pages and recognize in them the sad story of your life, will you forgive me? It is with no thought of disloyalty I write these few facts, Cally, but only that my love for you was so great, I would help, if possible, other girls to avoid the great mistake you made, my dear little friend. Perhaps it may help some mother to mould more carefully the character of the little girls given into her keeping. Exceptionally dainty and sweet you were, Cally, or so it seemed to the little mother who always adored you. Even as a child, you never loved unclean things as most children, and if your little hand or spotless apron ever became soiled you were not happy until you were cleansed and sweet again. As you grew, your dainty ways grew with you, and mother saw to it that nothing unlovely nor unclean came near you. So guarded were you. Was it any wonder, Cally, that you did not realize the value of your preciousness? Our friendship was a curious one, for I never seemed to be so clean that I did not leave marks, if ever I came in contact with your dainty self; and yet you loved me, and I, how I adored you, Cally! I was your humble servant, if you please, and acted as your mother confessor. You used to come to me with all your joys and sorrows, for I was two years older and far wiser than you, as you used to say. As I sit dreaming, Cally, are you still living, or is the Cally I loved, at least at rest? unanswered is my question, and my hand seems loath to pen the remainder of my little story. Dear little friend, do you know the picture I always see of you? The picture which appears before my eyes today. It is your sixteenth birthday, and you are dressed in pure white as you stand blooming among the roses. Do you remember, Cally, I picked the loveliest among them all and holding it towards you said: "Fair rose, behold your queen." You laughed happily, and reaching out your arms you drew an armful towards you and buried your sweet face among their fragrant petals. Your father, who was digging among the flowers, straightened his tired shoulders and gave you a little squeeze. "Oh, Daddy, don't, you will soil my new gown," you cried and turned away. 588 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Oh, Cally, did you see the hurt look on his face as he returned to his digging? You did not seem to, and passing on we gathered a few of the choicest flowers to take in to your mother. She was deep in the mysteries of a birthday cake, but raised a tired but happy face to smile and say, "How lovely you look, Cally. Go out, dear, it is so hot in here, you would soon wilt as well as the roses." You gave her a little peck of a kiss as we passed out, and I wondered, Cally, that you did not seem to notice the tired look in her eyes, so often there of late. Lovers there were a plenty, but you gave your sweetest smile to John. Big, stalwart John with honest blue eyes, eyes that looked straight at you, with a tinge of sadness hidden in their depths, for John had spent his days caring for his widowed, invalid mother. His one thought seemed to be of her and you, always of you, Cally, for he loved you since as children you attended the same school, for you grew up as neighbors together. John reigned supreme over your heart until Harry came, Harry, the landlord's son who had been away to college. Harry, the gentleman with dark brown eyes, smooth tongue and good to look at. And he loved you, too. The village was torn between love for John and desire to see you make a prize match, as they called it! But I, well I waited and prayed. How well I remember the day you gave John his answer. I was going in at your gate and met him as he came from among the roses; his face was white and drawn, and his eyes, I felt I could scream at the anguish in them. He said not a word but took my hand in a trembling grasp, and I turned and I walked beside him in silence, as we came in sight of his home, he said in a queer, strained voice, "Lou, you are a good old pal, and you have helped me. I might have known I was not good enough for her, but I loved her so — so." His voice choked and he turned away and disappeared in the trees. I did not see him again until the day before your wedding with Harry. John looked years older, and oh, so white and thin, but his eyes had a new determination in them. "Lou," he said, "I have come to say goodbye. Mother and I are leaving today. The change may help mother, and I can't stay here and see — her marry him. I could stand it better if he were worthy of her, but he isn't. And Lou" — here his voice was bitter, "she chooses him because he was more of a 'gentleman' than I; yes, she told me so." Then his voice was gentle again, "But Lou, you will be CALLY. 589 good to her, she will need a friend; and remember, I am going to make good. Goodbye, dear little friend." And then he went out of my life. I shall never forget the vision of loveliness you were on your wedding morn, and Harry was handsome, and so tender. I tried to forget John's words and be happy for you, too. Harry secured a position as bookkeeper in a distant town and you, too, Cally, went out of my life leaving me desolate indeed. For years your letters came regularly to cheer me. You were so happy, and Harry was the most indulgent of husbands. Now and then a sad note crept into your letters, they came so far between — then ceased altogether. Years passed and I heard of you again. A friend of mine visiting in your city, had heard your story, and this is what she told me. Harry grew tired of bookkeeping and became proprietor of a saloon. For awhile he did well, but finally became a victim of his own business, and ruin followed. She told of a sweet, sad-faced woman who struggled bravely along in poverty and shame. Finally at the death of her only child, she left her husband and went to live with her father, who had moved to another state. Her mother had long been dead. And that is all I know of your life, dear Cally, friend of my girlhood, but just one word of John. In my travels around the stake I met him in the little town of —. He is now bishop of a thriving ward, and has a family of lovely boys and girls, and a wife who adores him. It was the meeting with him again, and the renewal of our friendships that brought all these memories today. Though we never spoke of you, our hearts were filled with thoughts of our childhood home and of you, dear, dainty, sweet Cally! MY
