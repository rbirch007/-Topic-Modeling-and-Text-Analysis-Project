The Supply of Practical Nurses
======================================================================

Supply of Practical Nurses (Note: We copy this most interesting and timely article from a recent issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. It would seem that the condition here noted is universal). What's the matter with the trained nurse? A wave of harsh and resentful criticism of the professional nurse seems to be sweeping over the country. In spite of a recognition of her splendid achievement in remaking hospital nursing, and of setting up high standards for private nursing; in spite of her magnificent and sacrificial services in the great war, she is not now viewed by large numbers of physicians and laymen as a ministering angel of mercy or as an unmixed blessing. And when rebuked for these harsh expressions of disapproval, her unfeeling critics does What forcefully it mean? reply: "She is getting just what she deserves." Is it because through high standards of admission to her schools, and long years of training before she is graduated, she has chosen to make herself one of a small body of elect, a superior being? Is it because with the high cost of living and scarcity of these chosen few she has, labor-union-like, demanded higher pay which only the well-to-do can give? Is it because in the home she is autocratic and unwilling to serve except in accordance with rules that she herself lays down, often demanding that service be rendered her and causing discord in the household managem.ent at a time of crisis? Is it because in many hospitals she has gradually acquired more influence and power until through her officials she speaks with authority even to the management, and dictatorially demands that before the interest of the medical staff are considered — sometimes even before the interests of the patients — there must be considered those of the nurse? Perhaps there is a little truth in each one of these reasons. Perhaps in this resentful criticism, narrow as it may be, the nurses are reaping what they have sown. The war and the epidemic of influenza, with the consequent scarcity of nurses, have acutely drawn attention to the trained nurse and to the fact that she does not supply the suitable agent for ministering to the large body of the ill. The very poor may get free nursing in the hospitals or, if lucky at their homes through charity; the rich can and will pay whatever may be demanded but; the large mass of people of moderate means, too self-respecting to accept charity, not able to pay the high price of the expert nurse, must be deprived of her services or secure them at what to these people is often a ruinous sacrifice. More than this: a nurse of the highly trained type is not necessary nor even desirable in the vast majority of cases of illness. What are the requirements of a capable, skilled nurse, a 580 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. physician's assistant? First, a right personality; without this she is hopeless. Then intelligence, by which we mean a readiness of comprehension and understanding. Further, she should be of fair education, able to make herself understood, to write, to read, to reason. Lastly, she should have had training of sufficient length, probably one year, in a good hospital. This training should teach her the proper bed care of the ill, the preparation of food, the management of the patient — not his illness — and the methods of administering drugs and other remedial agents. She should learn enough of anatomy so that she will not, with her hypodermic syringe, enter the brachial artery; she should know enough of symptomatology to sense the possible significance of blood in the stool or of abdominal pain in typhoid; she should know enough pathology so that she will not wilfully violate the physician's orders against massaging a thrombosed femoral vein; she should have enough theoretical and practical training in bacteriology so that aseptic methods are to her, through her grasp of the reason underlying them, methods to be scrupuously followed. It goes without saying that other things— personality, native intelligence, etc. — being equal, the college school graduate will grasp these facts more readily and will, to this extent, be the more competent nurse. But such superknowledge is not necessary. For 90 per cent of cases of illness, a skilled nurse with the characteristics just enumerated and with one year's training will answer fully as well and will fit into the average household better. She will be a true physician's assistant and will be a household helper not too proud to assist in the kitchen, or even to help care for the baby. If this is true, why should not this capable woman of ordinary but sufficient ability and training be allowed to practice her profession licensed by the state and earning an honorable livelihood? There is a place for the highly trained nurse, the registered nurse of today. From their ranks will come the superintendents of the trainingschools of various grades, the head nurses in our hospitals, the nurses in our operating rooms, nurses for cases of special severity or complication, and the teachers of nurses. Let the training schools preserve their high ideals, though there may be question as to the necessity or wisdom of requiring even a high school degree for admission or a three years' course of training except in special cases or for postgraduate work. For her own good let the nurse be a little less autocratic, a little less dictatorial, a little more human. Non ministrari sed ministrare is as good a motto for a training school as for a woman's college. The trained nurse from having been a luxury has become a public necessity, like the telephone and railroad. Should not methods less like those of selfish private ownership give way to those wherein service to the sick public is the paramount aim?
