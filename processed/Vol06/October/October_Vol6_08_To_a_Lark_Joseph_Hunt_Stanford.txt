To a Lark Joseph Hunt Stanford
======================================================================

Lark. Heard singing near support lines during artillery service, February, 1918. By Joseph Hunt Stanford. How can you sing? 'Tis true the skies are blue, And in the air there comes a breath of spring; But hurtling death shrieks o'er the head of you — Beneath — around you — till it seems your wing Must surely brush the flying shot and shell That screams across the fields you love so well. How can you sing? The sun is warm, I know, Beyond what is this February's dew; And song's your business, whereso'er you go, 'Tis nothing more than we expect of you. But — here's my point^ — by what astounding chance Came you to sing in this grim part of France? Is there a message in the song you sing Which, could it be but rightly understood, Would cheer us in the faith that everything — E'en war — works only for some final good? Or do you sing because you have no choice — You're just a bird that must report its voice? About that "final good" you will agree (Should hopes of that your own free soul inspire) That there's but little here to make us see An eye to eye with you as you desire. The good to us seems altogether void, While with this bloody work we are employed. Look at the fields beneath you, do they please? Can you see aught but desolation there? Look at the blackened stumps that once were trees — Your wildest fancy cannot make them fair! Look in the hearts of men, then tell me true If you're so sanguine after that review. I hear your song, I, too, have often heard The song called Pippas — "God is in his heaven, So all's right with the world" ; but every word Seems mockery when all that world is given To mad ambition, treachery, and strife. And shameful sacrifice of human life. Still, keep on singing! To at least one ear It Your song is sweet, whate’er its meaning be; It makes devastation seem less drear, It wakes the music long asleep in me. For mine, and song's sweet sake, then, sing away— I'll try and scale the blue with you today.
