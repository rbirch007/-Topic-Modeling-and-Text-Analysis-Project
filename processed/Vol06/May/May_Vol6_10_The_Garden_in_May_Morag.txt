The Garden in May Morag
======================================================================

Garden in May. By Morag. Welcome! merry month of May Sunshine all the livelong day; Apple blossoms pink and white Scent the air. With wild delight Birds are singing, flowers are springing; 'Tis the lovely month of May. Earth is clothed in wondrous green; Now we'll choose our sweet May queen, Deck her brow with garlands bright. Peer of flowers, carnations white. Honor Mother, there's no other Like her, for our "Queen of May." The earlier part of May finds the garden beds irresistibly gay with the late tulips, hyacinths and daffodils, while the apple blossoms and lilacs fill the air with their perfume. Later in the month, the peonies and iris begin to show their rich colors, while at their feet bloom the pansies, primroses, pyrethrums and many of the spring flowering perennials and hardy shrubs. Seeds of cosmos, asters, stocks and nasturtiums may now be safely planted in the open ground, while plants of many varieties may be transplanted from the hotbed or cold frame. Many people set out plants immediately after a rain. A better method is to transplant on a dry day after sundown. Dig the hole the full depth of the plant's root length, place the plant in the hole, fill half full of water, throw in enough dirt to make a soft mud about the roots and fill with perfectly dry soil. The plant will seldom wilt, as the moisture at the roots evaporates very slowly, and there is none on the surface of the ground for the sun to bake or steam. Let us make a sunshine bed, or garden of gold. For a background plant double sunflowers or rudbeckia (golden glow). In front of this sow seeds of the tall African marigold, lemon and orange colored. Next caliopsis, or coreopsis, and yellow marguerites, then California poppies, and border the bed with mignonette or dwarf marigolds. If you want a flower bed which, in bloom, will rival heaven's own blue, plant giant larkspur at the rear, then anchusa, next a row of cornflowers, bordering with dwarf blue ageratum. 284 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. For a white bed plant nicotiaria, white asters, snapdragon, candytuft and sweet alyssum. For a quick growing hedge grow kochia or summer cypress. Its exquisite green, fihny foliage will grow about two and a half feet in one season and will turn to a glowing crimson in the autumn. Four o'clocks make another delightful low hedge, and their varied colors and fragrant flowers are a source of daily delight. The geraniums and petunias may be bedded out after the twenty-fifth of the month, and formal ornamental bed's made. A good edging plant is the blue and white lobelia. This is the month to plant out window and porch boxes and hanging baskets. The plainest and most unattractive house becomes cheerful with a few of them. And what won't they do for those monotonous apartment house windows? Fortunately window boxes are not expensive and can easily be made by the handy man at home, or the boy who learns carpentry at school. Whenever possible, boxes should be at least a foot wide and must have good drainage holes in the bottom, and filled with rich soil. Most of the common annuals are suitable for window gardening. Some of the best are petunias, salvias, parlor ivy, phlox, verbena and geraniums of all kinds, particularly the ivy-leaved varieties. For windows which are partly shaded, use begonias, fuchia, coleus, asparagus, sprengerie and plumosa nanus (lace fern). Window boxes and hanging baskets must be watered thoroughly and often. Remember Mother's Day, and bring her some flowers — carnations ifyou will, but preferably a growing plant which, if taken good care of, can be enjoyed not by mother alone but also by father and all the family. A thrifty syringa shrub, or snowball, for the home garden, or some choice lily bulbs may be purchased for the price of one florist's bouquet and would grow and continue in beauty for many succeeding years.
