Real Economy in the Home. By Clara Fagangren. Mrs. Tobbs ran over to her neighbor, Mrs. Snobbs, to see if she could use the telephone, (her own having been taken out for economical reasons). She stumbled and almost fell over the full g-arbage can outside the kitchen door, and could not but take a casual look at its contents; bits of bread, the tough ends of steak, stalks of celery, even half eaten pieces of cake confronted her eye. The door was opened by a half clad youngster, (although it was well after nine o'clock in the morning), having a pancake in one hand and a piece of candy in the other. "Come right in," he said, "mother is in the dining room, writin' her lecture for the Ladies' Club this afternoon. The neat and scrupulously clean Mrs. Tobbs crossed the untidy kitchen with its sink piled high with unwashed dishes, into the equally untidy dining room, where Mrs. Snobbs, attired in a soiled and frilly silk kimona and an elaborate boudoir-cap on her tousled head, was busily engaged in the task of writing out her speech on home economics, she being a prominent member of the leading women's club in the town. "Sit down," she said cordially to her friend, "do tell me how you manage to live with your large family these times when everything is so high; it's all we can do to meet our bills with only two children to support, while you have a family of eight." Mrs. Tobbs seated herself on the only chair in the room which was not streaked with grease or jelly. Folding her hands on her freshly ironed apron, she contemplated the other woman thoughtfully. "That is getting to be quite a problem," she admitted, "my husband is not getting any more money now than he did when things cost half what they do now, and it seems that the children's appetites are increasing every day; but thank the Lord for that, it's cheaper to buy bread than medicine." "But," Mrs. Snobbs persisted, "you must have variety in the diet. Here we are tired to death of roast and steaks, salads and cake, I wish I could think of something unusual. Yesterday I bought a lobster, it cost me forty cents a pound and two hours' work to prepare it and then we didn't seem to relish it." "Perhaps you have the habit of eating between meals," vouchsafed Mrs. Tobbs, who knew the Snobbs children were seldom seen without candy of some kind in their hands. She had 280 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. also been informed that their mother frequented the downtown cafes in the afternoons and evenings. "I let my family get good and hungry for their meals, and they find they are only too glad to sit down to the plainest of fare, just so there is plenty of it. Now for breakfast we always have either cornmeal or oatmeal mush, and if eggs are cheap, say twenty-five cents a dozen, we have them also. If not, I cook dried prunes Or peaches to be eaten with good home-made all wheat bread. Mr. Tobbs comes home in the middle of the day so we have our dinner then. The meat question doesn't bother me much since I made up my mind not to spend more than twenty cents for meat a day." "What!" cried Mrs. Snobbs aghast, "tell me what you can get for a family of your size for twenty cents? Our meat bill must be twenty dollars a month. Mr Snobbs claims it is extravagant, but one must eat." "I'll tell you," Mrs. Tobbs answered, "one day we have round steak cooked tender with an onion and potatoes. This makes a big meat pie, enough for us all. Sometimes the beefsteak is cooked pot-roast fashion. I make brown gravy and dumplings to make it reach; then for a change I get hamburger steak, add as much bread crumbs as tliQre is meat, with an tgg. a chopped onion, half a cup of milk and seasoning. Fried in cakes, this makes a dish fit for a king. Another way to cook this meat is to mix it the.same way and put it in a deep, greased pan, cover with a package of cooked spagghetti and bake in the oven. Still another economical way is to drop spoonfuls of the meat and parboiled cabbage leaves and bake in the oven thirty minutes. This way we have a change every day. I stopped baking pies and cake; we eat our fruit plain and find it much more wholesome. Where I used to buy three pounds of butter I get two; our income hasn't increased with the high cost of everything, so the only thing to do is to figure on the cheapest and most nourishing food." Mrs. Snobbs mentally added her expenditures; it dawned on her mind that she must have been extravagant, as she always ordered fruit and vegetables out of season, and the best cuts of meat because they were the most easily prepared. Her husband had double the income of Mr. Tobbs, still they never saved a dollar, while here were the Tobbs with their large family, living within their income and actually thriving. "I'm glad you came in," she said, "I've learned a lesson this morning. After this I'll consult you about marketing. Run over again, you are welcome to use our 'phone any time, for your visits are profitable. Good-morning!"
