A Lover of Grape Vines Frank R. Arnold
======================================================================

Lover of Grape Vines. Frank R. Arnold, U. A. C, Logan, Utah. It often takes a woman to get some things done on the farm or in the garden. My neighbor last summer "guessed" that his peartrees at the bottom of the garden would get enough water anyway, but his wife insisted on having a ditch made and seeing with her own eyes the water arrive at the tree roots and saved the pears. At Arbor Day time it is usually the wife who uses her influence to have the home orchard of varied varieties ( ?) planted which, with its many flavors, is so superior for home use to the commercial orchard which is restricted to two or three varieties. It is usually also the wife who picks out a sunny, protected corner by the kitchen door and suggests putting in a grape vine for table grapes and the joy of being able to sit under one's own vine and fig tree. Women are supposed to be more interested in fig leaves than vines, but the true homemaker loves them both. It is to be hoped that many Utah housewives will insist this year on putting in one or two grapevines, for although St. George is the favored vineyard spot of the State, there is no reason why the eastern benches of Utah, Salt Lake, Davis, and Box Elder counties should not be covered with grape vines and known as Utah's Rhineland. Here you have similar conditions to the famous Chautauqua grape district of New York. You have sunny hill sides with southern and western exposures to give the grape vines the warm feet that they love and the drainage, so necessary to their perfect development. You have two large lakes to temper cold weather in winter, equalize day and night temperatures in summer, lengthen the growing season and ward off early frosts, for in grape growing climate is more important a factor than soil. And the Utah bench soil is well suited to the grape, and if constantly cultivated needs no irrigation. If anyone does not believe that grapes may be grown in Davis county as easily and in as great a variety as in California he, or better, she, should make a visit to Mr. George Wood's vineyard on his ranch in the southeastern part of Bountiful. You leave the Bountiful car just before arriving at Val Verda and find yourself in an acre of Black Hamburg grapes. Up on the hillside is one of those stone houses that give Utah such an old-world look, while near by are stone barns with straw heaped upon the roofs like English thatched cottages. Here is a ranch of 300 acres, mainly given up to wheat and alfalfa, but remarkable for thirty acres of grapevines representing forty varieties. Paths shaded by almond trees lead from the stone farm house to two bungalows where live two married sons of Mr. Wood, for the pleasant custom is growing in Utah of living on the paternal estate, but having a house of your own. Mr. Wood's vineyard is famous in the Salt Lake market every fall, and at times you may see as many as thirty automobiles at his door all eager to go out into the vineyard and pick grapes. Unscrupulous automobile owners will also sometimes at night turn out their lights and invade the vineyard and help themselves to grapes without money and without price. They mash the grapes and tramp down the vines in the darkness and one guilty woman even shed an ostrich plume which was picked up the next morning by Mr. Wood. It didn't pay for the damage done and the grapes purloined. Some families in Utah, like the Caines in Richmond, take naturally and inevitably to stock raising. Others, like the Knudsons of Brigham City, have an inborn passion for horticulture, and Mr. Wood is a born grower of grapes. Next to his family his vineyard has been the great work of his life. He has built it up with local and California varieties, and now knows his vines so well that if you were to show him a vine cutting without leaf or fruit he could tell you immediately to which of his forty varieties it belonged. His father came from Dutchess county, in New York, where American grapes were first developed successfully, and though he did not have the New York horticultural passion it was recessive in his blood and he passed it on to his son. It is rare to find so many European and American grapes in an American vineyard, whether east or west. In the east you expect to find the American grapes and west of the Continental Divide you know the Californian or European varieties flourish, but Utah and Mr. Wood have given a royal welcome to both kinds and Mr. Wood is succeeding well with both. Thus the Black Hamburg does as well for him in the open air as it does in English conservatories. The Blue Malvoise he considers the best of table grapes, though it cannot be shipped far, owing to its tender skin. The White Tokay and the Flame Tokay he has acclimated until they are as hardy in Bountiful as in California. He finds the Muscatel the most hardy of the white grapes. The Cornichon and the Emperor winter-kill easily and need a long season. Most surprising of all, the Thompson's seedless grape, or Sultanina, as it is called in California, succeeds as well on Mr. Wood's land as it does in St. George. It is often ready by the end of August, and always by September 15, and some of the bunches weigh as high as seven pounds. Mr. Wood has also the Rose of Peru or Black Prince, a large black grape; the Verdell, a large white grape in loose bunches with a tender skin, and the Muscat, which with him is perfectly hardy. Of the eastern or "slip skin" varieties he has the Worden, Concord, Delaware, Niagara, Catawba, Isabella, and the Agawam, a red grape, much like the Concord. He finds the Malvoise and Muscatel the best market grape for Salt Lake, though the Concord is in such demand that he says he ought to have fifty acres of Concords to supply the demand. When a man has so many vineyard favorites it is hard for him to say just what is the best variety to plant, if you can have only one or two vines. He says that the Concord, Worden, Thompson's Seedless and Verdell can be raised in protected spots even as far north as Cache Valley. "If, however, I were restricted to one variety of grape," says Mr. Wood, "I'd take the Malvoise for first choice and the Muscatel for second. But if the wife wanted jelly, I'd have to plant Concords." Part of Mr. Wood's success with grapes is due to the fact that the Lord meant him to grow them, part also to soil and climate, and part to the care he gives his vines. When he has prepared his soil by ploughing from fifteen to eighteen inches deep, he dips his plants or cuttings in mud and sets them in straight lines, taking care to pack the soil very firmly about them and leave a hollow around each to catch the rain. The vineyard soil as a whole must be loose to hold air and warmth, but no roots or cuttings will start to grow unless there is firm contact between them and the soil. The cultivator is going all day long in Mr. Wood's vineyards until the grapes get so large there is danger of knocking them off. Then just as soon as the leaves begin to fall, pruning must be done so that ends may heal up well, otherwise the vines will bleed so that you would think it had been raining. Although you can get by watering the hills east of Bountiful, the vineyard needs no irrigation all summer, for just enough water to secure a good growth of vine gives the largest crop with the best quality and freest from fungi. The chief enemies of the vineyard are the robins and the grasshoppers. The first Mr. Wood has to scare away, the latter he poisons. "When the pioneers first came to this valley," says Mr. Wood, "it froze every month of the year. But Brother Brigham stretched out his hand and said, 'This land is adapted to small fruits,' and I had to help prove that his words were right. I used to see lots of grapes shipped into Salt Lake, and when I took my first load to an Italian there he said to me, 'Be patient and you will arrive.'" Patience, religion, and a love of one's work will get a man anywhere.
