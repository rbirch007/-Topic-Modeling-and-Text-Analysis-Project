======================================================================

Rainbows on War Clouds. New Book of Poems by Col. James L. Hughes. The war has demanded great sacrifice, developed latent nobility, in the nations taking part, and in a few instances has inspired poetic speech from both experienced and inexperienced songsters. No one tribute to the war and its sacrificial altar has moved America more than the clear and beautiful poetic stanzas written by Col. James I.. Hughes, the famous educator, poet and soldier. He was Dr. James L. Hughes to us in Utah, fifteen years ago, when he came to visit us and to give his stirring lectures on "Kindling," "The Old Training and the New," and especially on the educational side of his friend the great Charles Dickens. His only son, Chester Hughes, was an early hero who laid down his life, November 15, 1915. That great personal grief and the horror of war has not extinguished the Christian hope of life after death, one reads all through the book of poems which Col. Hughes has just published, Rainhoivs on War Clouds, which may be purchased from C. W. Bardeen, Syracuse, New York. The simplicity of Wordsworth and the spiritual insight of Browning mark these radiant tributes to life's richest values. It is impossible to indicate all of the lovely sentiments crystallized in musical verse, but note this: 282 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. life's vital power. "The battlefield has many scars, But life has vital power, and so New branches spring from broken trunks; New leaves on shattered branches grow. "Though some have feared that faith was dead. And that no more its light would shine; Through sacrifice and service, faith Has grown in beauty more divine. "So from the despot's ruthless war True freedom will in beauty grow O'er all the earth, till brotherhood In human hearts will ever grow." The poems which circle around the grave of his son Chester shine with the lustre of faith and hope, while his tributes to American loyalty demonstrate the new and close comradeship felt by both England and Canada for America and her flag. "old glory" and "the union jack." " 'Old Glory' has new glory now. Its message to the truly free Is universal, unconfined By boundaries of land or sea. "Beside the flags of other lands That love democracy and right, Americans 'Old Glory' bear To break the power of despot might. " 'Old Glory' and the Union Jack Have waved good will a hundred years, And smile acro.ss our border land. Hats off to them, and rousing cheers! "And they will float in harmony Through all the ages yet to be; And help to make the whole wide world Join in fraternal unity." Col. Hughes is a brother of the no less distinguished Sir Sam Hughes who has been so marked a figure in Canada during the war. Another brother is Gen. Garnet Hughes, and still another is also a colonel.
