Objections to Temple Work Joseph A. West

work, she is "killing herself" for the family. If she has servants, she ought to be more economical. Objections to Temple Work. By Joseph A. West. It is claimed by those who do not believe in the efficiency of temple work, that the act of one individual can have no saving effect upon another, and yet all Christianity believes in the vicarious work of the Christ. In fact, this is the foundation stone, or basic principle, upon which every form of Christianity is builded. As a magnanimous Elder Brother, Jesus died to redeem man from eternal death; he gave himself as a propitiation for the sins of all who would believe on him with that vital faith which would impel in the believer a willing obedience to every requirement of the gospel. From the death pronounced upon Adam, and his posterity, we are redeemed unconditionally, but we only get forgiveness of our personal sins through compliance with the ordinances of the gospel administered by one having divine authority. Another objection to temple work, on the part of those of little faith, is the supposition that much thus done may not be finally accepted by, and thus be made effective for, those in whose behalf it may have been performed. Would it not be quite as reasonable for our missionaries to say that because the great majority of those who hear the gospel message in the world will not believe and obey the same, they would feel justified in refusing the call to preach it? As a matter of fact few refuse whose financial circumstances will permit them to meet the expenses of a mission, spending, usually, two years in the service at a cost to them in time and money of approximately two thousand dollars each. Even then it is very likely, as has been the experience of many, that they may not baptize a single person during the time. In the temple, however, a thousand souls can be redeemed in a day with little or no expense. Middle-aged men, with whom the writer has discussed the importance of doing temple work, make the excuse that this is essentially work for the aged, and that when they get old they will discharge this responsibility. Perhaps so. But they do not stop to think that it requires much more than the mere work of officiating in a vicarious way. The record work is really of the greatest importance, and if not done correctly, endless trouble and confusion may result, while the work so done is in danger of being duplicated. This duplication of work, which the utmost care alone will prevent, is worse than a waste of time and means, for it borders on the sacrilegious, when there is so much to do and so little time to do it in. 516 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. As all mankind, by the uprightness of their lives, are not candidates for the celestial kingdom, "for broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be which go in thereat," there might be some excuse for not performing other ordinances than baptisms for the dead; and yet how can a person know, without the omniscience of God himself, who will or who will not ultimately accept of the whole truth? Can we not better afford, therefore, to do the complete work for a hundred persons rather than take the chance of missing one of the choice and worthy souls who cannot otherwise be saved? The writer has had the following passages quoted to him: "The glory of the telestial is one, even as the glory of the stars is one, for as one star differs from another star in glory, even so differs one from another in glory in the telestial world. * * * For these are they who say they are some of one and some of another, — some of Christ, and some of John, and some of Moses, and some of Elias, and some of Esaias, and some of Isaiah, and some of Enoch; but received not the gospel, neither the testimony of Jesus, neither the prophets, neither the everlasting covenant. * * * These are they who are cast down to hell and suffer the wrath of Almighty God, until the fulness of time when Christ shall have subdued all enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work. * * * But, behold, and lo, we saw the glory and the inhabitants of the telestial world, that they were as innumerable as the stars in the firmament of heaven, or as the sand upon the sea shore, and heard the voice of the Lord, saying — these all shall bow the knee, and every tongue shall confess to him who sits upon the throne for ever and ever." Notwithstanding this, is it not reasonable to suppose that the spirit of Elijah has worked upon us to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers in the last days? For it has also made itself wonderfully manifest among the Gentiles in inspiring them to prepare and publish their genealogies, without which much of our temple work could not be done; it is that spirit which has directed the preparation of those lines of ancestry that were most worthy of the gospel message. There are very few of the Saints, who have not been marvelously blessed in this respect. Nearly all who enter the sacred precinct of the temple have some line of ancestry to work upon, and as they are universally of the seed of Israel, their progenitors must also have inherited the same precious blood, or such forefathers could not have transmitted the blood to the living heirs of today. In other words, all those of a given ancestry may be said to be largely among the number of those to whom the Savior referred in that passage — "My sheep know my voice, and a stranger they will not follow." OBJECTIONS TO TEMPLE WORK. 517 When men, through death, become separated from all the alluring things of life, such as wealth, position and preferment among men, and find their preconceived notions of many things relative to the hereafter swept away, and the great wall of prejudice surrounding them here broken down, as it very likely will be, doubtless countless thousands will turn to the truth with full purpose of heart and joyously receive the merciful message of our beloved Redeemer. Upon this point President Penrose has the following to say: "It is necessary to our perfection as well as the perfection of our ancestors that these ordinances shall be performed, and none of our work will be wasted. The time will come when those who do not at first accept the gospel in the spirit world, through the experience which they will have to suffer, will be willing to bow the knee to King Emanuel and acknowledge him to be the Lord, to the glory of God the Father; and every ordinance performed for them will stand in its place, and effect its object at some period or other." (Utah Hist, and Gen. Magazine, Vol. 9, No. 3, page 135.) Joseph Smith the great latter-day prophet also says: "It is not only necessary that you should be baptized for your dead, but you will have to go through all the ordinances for them, the same as you have gone through to save yourselves. There will be 144,000 saviors on Mount Zion, and with them an innumerable host that no man can number. Oh! I beseech you to go forward, go forward and make your calling and your election sure. * * * Every man that has been baptized and belongs to the kingdom has a right to be baptized for those who have gone before; and as soon as the law of the gospel is obeyed here by their friends who act as proxy for them, the Lord has administrators there to set them free." (Hist, of the Church, Vol. 6, p. 365.) The only way that men can become saviors to their fellowmen, that I know anything about is by doing vicarious work for them in the temples of the living God. Temples built for this purpose, with the exception, perhaps, of Solomon's temple, in ancient Jerusalem, are of very modern origin. Do you recall the one hundred and forty-four thousand and the innumerable host that will accompany them and be with the Savior upon Mount Zion in the latter-days, who appear as saviors? Surely these must include those who are the faithful workers in the temple of the Latter-day Saints, for these faithful ones are the only people on the earth today doing work of a vicarious character which would entitle them to this exalted appellation. Upon another occasion the prophet said, "Those Saints who neglect it [speaking of the work for the dead in behalf of their deceased relatives,] do it at the 518 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. peril of their own salvation." (Hist, of the Church, Vol. 4, p. 425.) On January 20, 1844, more than seventy-five years ago, he made the following prediction: "The saints have not too much time to save and redeem their dead and gather their living relatives, that they may be saved also, before the earth will be smitten, and the consummation decreed falls upon the earth." (Hist, of the Church.) It was a long time after this announcement by the prophet before the first temple, in which these ordinances could be uninterruptedly performed, was completed: that at St. George, in 1877; and if the time was short in which this work could be done seventy-five years ago, how short, indeed, must it be today. Should not the Saints, therefore, arouse themselves to the importance of doing this work now, "while the day lasts" and the opportunity therefore is within our reach? Already the latter-day judgments are sweeping over the earth, and all our temples have been closed more than once because of the "desolating scourge" that the Prophet Joseph said should "go forth among the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured out from time to time, if they repent not, until the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming." (Doc. & Cov., 5:19.) Our duty is plain, yet we must share the judgments of these last days. It is asked: Will not God preserve from ordinary sickness and death all those who are worthy to go to the temple and enter upon the performance of this important work that has been enjoined upon all the Saints? Let us quote further from the History of the Church, Vol. 4, p. 11: "It is a false idea that the Saints will escape all the judgments, whilst the wicked suffer; for all flesh is subject to suffer, and 'the righteous shall hardly escape;' still many of the Saints will escape, for the just shall live by faith; yet many of the righteous shall fall a prey to disease, to pestilence, etc., by reason of the weakness of the flesh, and yet be saved in the Kingdom of God. So that it is an unhallowed principle to say that such and such have transgressed because they have been preyed upon by disease or death, for all flesh is subject to death; and the Savior has said, 'Judge not, lest ye be judged.' " Is it not, therefore, our duty, both young and old, to do all that lies in our power? There are many high priests retired from active service in the Church, and many very worthy aged sisters, too, who could glorify the closing years of their lives by performing temple work for their dear departed dead, whom they soon will meet in the spirit world. Let us go forward, therefore, and perform this glorious work for our dead.
