pictures of the Genealogical Society and add here information concerning that magnificent office. The library is not only housed luxuriously with appointments of the best and most up-to-date type, but the carefully selected books also form one of the most complete small collections known in the world. THE NATURE OF THE COLLECTION. One of the principal objects of the Genealogical Society of Utah is to gather into one library all the genealogical information it possibly can from whatever source and location in the whole world. We realize that the Spirit of Elijah has brooded and is brooding over the world as well as in the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, and this spirit has prompted men and women and communities to have great concern for the records of their dead. Many of the oldest records are in danger of being destroyed by the natural decay of time, and many also are not easy of access to the general public. To remedy these difficulties, interested communities, societies and individuals have taken it upon themselves to have these records copied, and printed in books, thus saving them for future generations and also making them easy of access to the public. This gathering and printing of records is especially prevalent in the British Isles, and in the New England states of our own country. Logically, there is where the greatest interest should be taken for there is the source of genealogical information for the English speaking peoples. The Genealogical Society of Utah has been purchasing all such records as fast as its means and opportunity afforded. It has now on the shelves of its library over 5,000 volumes. These books represent quite a variety of nationalities and languages, including, besides the English, German, French, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Italian and Spanish. Of course, the great bulk consists of English printed books from England and the United States. These books consist of vital records family histories, town and country histories, many of which contain genealogies of families living in the towns or counties, census reports, Revolutionary and Civil War records, etc. The English books are mostly copies of parish registers which contain records of births or baptisms, marriages and deaths or burials; histories of counties and parishes, and pedigrees of ancient families as collected by the Visitations in England. None of these books are for sale. They are solely for the use of the members of the society. A membership in the society entitles him or her to search these records and to take from them all the names he or she is entitled to. (Each person is entitled to four lines, namely, his father's line, his father's mother line, his mother's mother line and his mother's father line). A record is kept in the office of all who are taking names to avoid duplication. Naturally, the first inquiry a person in search of genealogy would make is: "Is there a printed book or genealogy of my family?" If there is and the society has it, fortunate is that individual. He may then proceed to copy from the book the names contained therein which belong to him, checking each name as it is taken; or he may obtain a copy of the book from the publisher, 526 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. if that is possible, for his own home use. If no such family record is published, then the next resource is to search the vital records, the histories, the parish registers, etc., and glean from them such names as he has a right to, connect them, if possible, into family groups, and prepare them for use in the temple. This, as stated, is the right of all members of the society. This, of course, requires an individual visit to the library in Salt Lake City. As a great many of the members cannot visit the library personally, provision is made for competent clerks who understand the books and the work of copying, to be engaged to do this work for those who desire it. The charge for the work is, for members of the society, 40 cents an hour, for non-members of the society, 50 cents an hour. All who desire such research work done or who wish to make inquiries regarding it should address the Genealogical Society of Utah, 47 East South Temple street, Salt Lake City, Utah. We would suggest to our readers and friends that it is not only a privilege but likewise a duty for every adult member of the Church to become identified with this Society. Pres. Anthon H. Lund is the President, Pres. C. W. Penrose, the Vice-President, Apostle Joseph Fielding Smith is the Secretary and Treasurer, and Bishop Joseph Christenson is the Librarian. The Society publishes a splendid magazine quarterly, of which our famous story-writer, Nephi Anderson is Editor. Miss Lillian Cameron, the Assistant Librarian, is a member of the General Board of the Relief Society and forms a link, as it were, between these two great and important organizations. The future of this whole work is as boundless and limitless as the gospel. Are you a member of the Genealogical Society of Utah? If not, why not? NO-TOBACCO JOURNAL A brave and wise prophet has arisen in the wilderness of the modern narcotic tendencies to cry out against the deadly evils of tobacco. This courageous exponent of sane living and high thinking is Mr. L. H. Higley who publishes a monthly paper which is the organ of the No-Tobacco League of America. The low cost of this splendid little paper, 25c a year, ought to put it in the reach of every Latter-day Saint parent. Subscribe for it, friends, and read the wise helps it will give you in the effort we should all put forth to stem the flood of tobacco-using which the war-camps, aided by the Y. M. C. A., the Salvation Army and other like organizations poured out upon our young and impressionable boys. Go to it, Comrade Higley, we stand with you! The
