What's the Price? Mary Foster Gibbs
======================================================================

What's the Price? Mary Foster Gibbs. "Mother, O, Mother, Austin has cheated me out of my fifty cents. Make him give it up!" The child's voice, shrill, and full of distress, startled the white-haired woman who sat on the porch mending a fine lace collar. As she looked up from her work she saw the twelve-year-old girl fling out her hand and scratch the face of her younger brother with vicious haste. "Vilate, Vilate, I say, what are you doing?" The little girl swung about. "Aunt Elizabeth, he's got my money, and he won't give it up. Make him give it to me." "She said I could have her old fifty cents, if I would find her old ring." "Well, and he hasn't found it, and he can't, but he has stolen my money, anyway." The child was shaking with grief and outraged feelings, while her brother stood his ground, angrily wiping the blood stains from his face and making faces at the little girl, to prove his contempt for her weakness and temper. "Make him give it to me," cried the disconsolate child, when suddenly the mother came to the front door. "What is it, children? What are you making all this noise for? Don't you know that your aunt can't stand such scenes?" "It is not my nerves, Bertha, that distress me, but I wish you would learn just what is the truth here," said the elderly woman, as she tried to soothe the little girl by drawing her into her arms. "Mother, Austin asked me what I would give him to find my ring — " "Have you lost your birthday ring?" sharply countered the mother, and, as the child only hung her head in renewed shame and grief, the mother caught her angrily out of the older woman's arms, and slapping her venomously, she said between her teeth: "Go up stairs, you bad, wicked child, and go to bed and stay there till I tell you to come down. I'll tell your father about this, and he'll not only punish you properly but you'll never get another present. Go now, do you hear?" The poor child crept away crying as if her soul were melting into fiery streams within the breast of her. "Bertha, wouldn't it be just as well to ask Austin his side of the story?" 520 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. The tired and impulsive mother, herself without power of self-control, gave a sullen glance of dismay at her aged aunt, and yet she said, "Come now, Austin, what's your row about? What have you been doing, now?" "Aw, nothing much, I just made Vilate mad about some money she promised me by taking it outen her bureau drawer before she was ready." "O, you children will drive me mad. I can't stand all your nonsense, I wish you would go out of my sight for the day." The boy himself, half-guilty, half-remorseful, half-glad at his ill-gotten triumph, went away down the front path, his face betraying his disgust with life in general and himself in particular. "I know you think I am too hasty with the children, Aunty, but I can't help it. I don't care, either." The older woman said nothing; what was there to say? But an infinite sadness stole over her face, and tears stood in her eyes as she turned to go upstairs. The evening supper, on the cool, back porch was a triumph of good cooking and dainty service. The events of the day had been smoothed out by the forgetful touch of time, and other interesting happenings, and now the father was ready to laugh and joke at every turn in the story which his wife made so interesting and pert, about the children's long and dismal quarrel. "The ring was not expensive, mama," he said, as that part of the story came into view. "And I do hope you were not too severe on Vilate." "Well, she is here to speak for herself. But let's forget it. Still, I must say that Austin does show signs of the same splendid business ability which my family have always manifested. And I was tickled to death at the cute way he got out of the hole." Austin's sharp features drew on another shrewd line, as his mother drew the long bow in his defense, and added praise for his chicanery. The little girl sat by, too humiliated to defend herself, or to try to make clear her case in the matter. "Nathaniel," said the soft-voiced old lady at the other end of the table. "What is the current price of old-fashioned honesty?" "Well, Aunty, I guess it's about as it always was, good for its face value, if the face towards you is to your advantage." "Nat, you will shock Aunty, she is so old-fashioned, you know." And with chaffing and gay laughter, the little family got up from the table and crowded into the auto for the evening ride along the shady lanes surrounding the city of Provo. "You'll have to get gas, Nat, I am sure we're out. I used it WHAT'S THE PRICE? 521 up this morning with my shopping," said the wife, as they all drew softly out of the yard. "All right, it's gas for us, then," and as they waited at the near-by garage, the wife was describing how she had "done" the grocer boy out of half his bill, with merry quip and much scorn at the slow-witted lad who brought her produce and bills to the door. Driving swiftly along the clean roads and down the shady lanes of Provo, the young father said thoughtfully, "Vilate, I believe that fellow gave me too much change. I should only have three dollars and sixty cents back and he gave me four dollars." "Better go back, Nat, and make it right," said his aunt gently. "O, nonsense," cried the wife sharply, "go back for such a trifle? I guess not. They make enough on their old gas to justify us in getting the best of them whenever we can. I have put it over on that garage man several times myself, and serves him just right." "But that's such a fearful price to pay," interposed the old lady. "Of course it's a fearful price, Aunty, that's why I say we are quite justified in getting the best of the whole crew, whenever we can." The gentle-faced old woman said nothing. Turning the talk in other channels, she kept them merry with her stories of her young life and its pioneer vicissitudes. That evening Aunt Elizabeth asked her nephew-in-law to walk with her down to the post-office to mail an important letter. As soon as they were alone, she said, earnestly, "Nathaniel, I am sure you don't realize the price you are paying for the come-easy, go-easy policy which obtains in your financial affairs, both in your home and perhaps in your broker's business. You know that your wife's uncle was my husband; but you don't know how I struggled for years to keep a stern standard of right and wrong, of honesty in trifles as the guiding star of our domestic lives. Like your dear and careless wife he was practically irresponsible in money matters. His father before him had no money to do with, but he was called "shifty," by his pioneer neighbors. He got the best of every trade, and not always in ways that were clearly right. You have asked me several times since I came down from Idaho to pay you this long-promised visit, where my son James is, and I have always evaded you. Nathaniel; he is in state prison for embezzlement. What I have suffered, no one but God knows. I did try with all my soul to teach him aright; but there was his father always ready to laugh at Jimmie when he cheated at marbles, at his lessons, and finally at his beginnings in 522 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. business life. He called it native wit. Since your uncle's death, Jimmie has been living far away from our old home. His marriage with a vain and selfish girl, although she was not of our faith, was, I hoped, going to steady him and make him see the truth. But it was first smoking, then card-playing, in these pernicious evening parties, and finally he got so he would not look into the meetinghouse, nor would he pay a cent of tithing. He jeered at the principle. And then it was, I began to fear for his inner standards. No honest and upright man will make sport of that sturdy and righteous method for the just expenses of the Church to be kept up. And so — when — when — " "My dearest Aunt Elizabeth, I have no words to tell you of my sympathy and sorrow in this your terrible trial." "O yes you have, my son. Just tell me that you will take a different course yourself, in your own domestic affairs. Your own son is headed in the wrong direction. As a matter of fact, he lied to his mother, and he actually did steal his sister's money, for they admitted the whole facts to me. And yet you can make light of these serious and dangerous things." "Auntie, as I live, I will take my son in hand." And the disturbed man reached down and grasped his aged relative's hand to squeeze it in token of his covenant. "Take yourself in hand, my son. Do you recall your careless acceptance of the cheating you practiced on the garage man about the gas? You must reach this reform in a tactful way, for your charming and faithful little wife does not realize for one moment the loose standards she has inherited. And she is so good in so many ways. Don't hurt nor antagonize her, for she loves you and tries hard to please you. But remember, my son, the children have no god but you — until they reach the age of reason." The man said nothing, he was too deeply moved. "These precious children will take your words, your acts as their guide. They may go to Sunday school and primary, be kind and jolly and sweet, but their morals, for all the years of their innocent and helpless childhood, are fixed upon the standards of your lightest, everyday acts and words. And oh, how careful you must be. Boys rarely rise above the business standards of their fathers, although the mothers set the religious lines into their characters. And now — let us not stay away too long. My sorrow is my own. I would wish that you tell Vilate in the right way, and when she is in the proper mood, for I don't want her to either justify him nor to blame his father too much. We all have our share in these things. And as I look back I can see that I did not exact justice from him in little things; I let my work and worry hinder me from taking him while very young and teaching him the severe moral code that underlies even the trifles of life. His WHAT'S THE PRICE? 523 childish sins of fruit-stealing, of cheating at marbles, and of lying to cover up his errors, I thought he would grow out of, if I only told him about it. I should have enforced some rigid rules. But — he is there — and oh, my boy — the price I am paying is so high — so high — " "God comfort you, Auntie, I can't." "Yes, yes you can. Let me make his sin and my sorrow the means of saving some others. And don't think but what I write him constantly and show him the beauty of the gospel — how tender our Savior is, how eager he is to help us, and to lift us up — it is the gospel of hope we have — if it were not for that, I think I should die or lose my senses." In silence they returned home, the elder woman whispering at times, "The price — the price — " TO MY
