Editorial ? Are We Always Honest?
======================================================================

ARE WE ALWAYS HONEST? The human conscience is not a fixed or static condition of mind. It is true, we are born with a right balance or conscience with which to determine what is right and what is wrong, but environment and education greatly modify, or even change altogether, this inherited standard of spiritual values. Our Father implanted within us at our spiritual birth his own perfect standard of right and wrong, and we brought that with us when we came to this earth. The conscience is an instinctive knowledge of law and its consequences. Here is a moral law. If we break it, we pay the price; if we keep it, we enjoy the reward, and it is this inherited knowledge of law or "conscience" which is a part of our divine inheritance. Conscience, however, is modified by tradition, by the unconscious education of childhood, and by our own will in regard or disregard of its promptings. A man's conscience varies with the acts of a man, and descends with him to the lowest depths, justifying him in his actions; or ascends with him to the greatest heights, glorifying him with its rewards, yet constantly prodding him to higher moral attainment, to richer spiritual rewards. It is a mistake to imagine that men who do wrong and women who sin know that they are doing wrong and feel that they are sinning. Talk to the lowest criminal that walks the street or languishes in a prison cell. He justifies himself in the course he has taken. If it 546 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. were not so, his waking hours would be unendurable. As long as a man's conscience is sensitive and pricks him making him feel that he is in the wrong, at times, so long does he possess the power of repentance and reformation; but criminals, apostates, degenerates, in short all types of men, from the highest to the lowest, modify and change the conscience to fit their life conditions and to permit them to enjoy a measure of self justification. Many wicked men are tender to their wives and mothers, careful and cautious in their guardianship of children. They salve conscience, as it were, with the practice of fine domestic virtues; while some very good men are oppressive in the treatment of their wives and families. Such good men unconsciously justify their smaller domestic sins because of their larger personal virtues and moralities. With the criminal as with the good man the blame for his wrongdoing always is laid upon the other fellow or upon society. There are fixed moral laws, as perfect and as rigid as are the laws of light and heat, but our knowledge of those laws depends upon the adjustment of our lives in conformity with them. It is this little bit of psychology that we mothers and grandmothers should become familiar with in dealing with our children and grandchildren. The child is a savage, or rather, he has the primitive instincts of a savage, to take what he wants where he finds it. Unselfishness and a quick understanding of the rights of others, must always be taught by the mother or guardian directly or indirectly. Some children are born with naturally unselfish and courteous dispositions, yet the law of survival prompts every child to seize that which it desires no matter who suffers in consequence. Even little babies, however, can be taught to be thoughtful of the rights of others, to be quiet while grandma is sick, to give the rocking chair to grandpa, and, as they grow older children can easily be taught never to impose upon each other, nor to take that which belongs to brother or sister, mother or friend, school mate or stranger, without permission and courteous request. Neglect of this primal law too often results in a dishonest foundation for character which will canker the developing child and will even destroy future usefulness and be a menace to civic peace. Might is never right unless it is founded on just and moral laws. Children who see parents cheat street car companies out of a transfer, railroad companies out of a ticket, shop keepers and business men out of every possible cent; who hear parents tell half truths to neighbors, and watch father cheat in his dealings in business or trade. What can you expect of such children? They feel themselves perfectly justified in stealing the neighbors' eggs and fruit, their companions' books, pencils, rubbers and playthings. What father does and what mother says is always all right to children. EDITORIAL. 547 What ideals are we setting up for these modern children of ours? Do we justify ourselves in drinking a cup of tea? In lying about social matters to our friends? In appropriating lost articles and keeping borrowed books or other things? If we do, it is small use for us to tell the children to be temperate, honest and truthful. Sermons from the pulpit, lessons from the Sunday school, attendance at Mutuals, are useless, practically, unless the home life is carefully guarded and the children are faithfully taught daily and regularly in the small honesties of daily life. If children steal fruit, or eggs, they should return them and pay for them. If they cheat in marbles, and father should find out whether they do or not, father should shame the boys out of such a pernicious habit. If girls borrow each others' or mother's finery, without permission, the act should be noted at once, apologized for, and the unjust act should never be repeated. We should never "help ourselves" to anybody's property, under any circumstances, unless due permission is asked and granted. We mothers and grandmothers should scrupulously guard the rights of our children, our hired help, and the rights of ourselves. Do not think these are trifling matters. They lie at the very root of our life mission, sisters and friends. NEW BOOK ON THE "MORMONS." Dr. James E. Talmage's new book is a compilation of the clear and lucid articles which have been appearing in the press of the country from the famous pen of Dr. James E. Talmage. These are now issued under the title of "The Vitality of Mormonism." A happy title for the book would have been, Half Hours With the Gospel, for each article can be read in just about that amount of time. They are eminently modern in tone and are delightfully easy to read and absorb. Perhaps the greatest service done by Dr. Talmage in this series of spiritual expositions of the principles of the gospel is the arrangement in many and varied aspects and the rich array and limitless scope of the truths, and spiritual laws, together with the modernizing of these age old principles. Truth persists but its approach varies with times, people and moods. Dr. Talmage has succeeded in placing, lucidly before the world, and not only before the world, but also before our own young people, the eternal and divine principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We welcome this contribution to our home Church works.
