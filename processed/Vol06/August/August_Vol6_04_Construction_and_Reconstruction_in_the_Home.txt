Construction and Reconstruction in the Home. SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR CHILDREN'S CLOTHES. Dressing children sensibly and becomingly is perhaps a slightly more difficult task than it is generally considered. It is not difficult to secure, through fashion magazines, many good patterns for cutting children's clothes. However, the following suggestions may be valuable: The most important point to consider is whether or not the dress is hung properly from the shoulder. It should for hygienic reasons hang from the shoulder so that there is no restriction around the growing body. The present styles show many good ideas for skirt and waist as well as one-piece effects which have this necessary looseness in the waist line. If the neck, shoulders and armseye are not properly fitted together there will be a dragging effect of either front or back which is both uncomfortable and unsightly. On the other hand, if properly cut and fitted together the plainest little dress possible will set comfortably and properly about the upper part of the body. It is not difficult to regulate the lower part of the skirt or sleeves if the upper part is properly adjusted. No amount of care and work in trimming and finishing can cover this foundational fault. In the selection of styles for children use common sense and stay with the plainer, more simple designs. Children can stand severity in this regard far better than grown people, in fact the natural charms of childhood should never be subordinated to fussy, over-trimmed clothes. Touches of hand-work are very attractive for children's clothes. I am fully aware that a busy mother does not have time to spend in elaborate embroidery, so am offering some suggestions in the use of stitches and designs with which one may complete a dress in an evening. The inexpensiveness of hand-trimming is another point worthy of consideration, with the present prevailing high prices of good laces and embroideries. In the cutting of the so-called "Butterfly" styles, avoid if 482 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE possible the very bias seam which runs from the under arm to the bottom of the dress. There are two big objections to this or any other pattern which calls for a similar seam. First — they are bound to sag and pull the entire dress out of shape. Second — they do not look well in figured materials, especially in plaids. Figure I— Will give you an idea of how you may cut the same pattern with the seam straight (or nearly so) and still have the necessary fulness at the bottom of the skirt. Instead of cutting away the material from under the arm, place it in an inverted box-plait the top of which may be finished on the wrong side and fastened to the outside invisibly. EXPLANATION OF STITCHES. Figure II — Here is a simple yet new use of the lazy-daisy stitch. The line just inside the neck may be worked in an outline of some kind either in black or white. Work the lazy-daisy stitches in white floss of a coarse size. Then go over the end stitches with a black stitch and place a black French knot in the center. On pink, blue or any plain color gingham, this black and white is very effective. If the material happens to be white, use a pale shade of some color in place of the white and use the black as stated above. Figure III — Here is a simple spray constructed of the same stitch and an outline stitch. First mark a dot with a pencil for the center of each flower and a spool is a good size to use as a guide for the outside edge of the flower. Figure IV — Gives you an idea of how the lazy-daisy stitch and cross-stitch may be used to construct a border design. This may be used anywhere a band trimming would be appropriate. Figure V — Is a border constructed of the cal-stitch, crossstitch and chain-stitch. This is effective worked out in black and white or in two colors. Figure VI — Shows how the common feather-stitch may be worked into petal shapes to form flowers or leaves. Below is a detail of the feather-stitch as commonly used. When worked very close as shown in the flower the loop in the center gives the effect of a center vein. Figure VII — Circles of this kind are effective as separate units of design and may be worked out in any outline stitch. They are easily worked from any small round object. Figure VIII — Shows how the circle and square may be used by working the center solid with an edge of some outline stitch on the outside. ON THE
