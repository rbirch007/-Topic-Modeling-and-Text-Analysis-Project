WATCH TOWER James H. Anderson. Three notable topics of interest in June were the signing of the peace treaty by Germany and the Entente allies with the exception of China, on June 28; numerous labor strikes in Europe and America, most of which proved failures on the part of the strikers; and an aeroplane trans-Atlantic flight from Newfoundland to Ireland, on June 15, in 16 hours and 27 minutes. The German cabinet was overthrown, and disastrous riots occurred in German cities, co-incident with the signing of the peace treaty, with a prospect of still further disturbances. Labor strikes in France, Great Britain, Italy, Austria, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and in the United States, both locally and generally, added greatly to the prevailing spirit of unrest, but had mostly calmed down for a time at the end of June. Captain Jack Alcock, an Englishman, and Lieutenant Arthur Brown, an American, were the aviators who made the non-stop trans-Atlantic flight, establishing a new world-record in aerial navigation.

Miss Margaret Horsley, of Price, Utah, has been chosen to name the new government vessel, on July 31, at Oakland, Cal.
