A Utah Mornng Maud Baggarley
======================================================================

Utah Morning. By Maud Baggarley. Veiled in mist, the mountains lie Like poet's dream or faint mirage Against the April sky. A little teasing bee at play, (Like sweet but naughty child) At threshold of the day, Starts like humming bird, Or honey bee, about each blossom-laden tree. Upon the grass the jocund sun Hath scattered largess for each one Whose eager hands can grasp and hold His measure of the fairy gold. Little jostled birds complain; The dim earth glows with sudden light; The peach trees burn with magic flame; And lo, the morning bright Unfolds her wings upon the azure hills. And through the veins of earth there thrills New ecstasy of life.
