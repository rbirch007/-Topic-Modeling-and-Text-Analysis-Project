'tis June, Life's high noon; Perfect days, pleasant ways. Life's rich blessings crown your days. Lift your soul in grateful praise. Night comes soon! Keep in tune. June, 'tis June. I The month of June brings to us the magic fulfilment of our hopes of early Spring, a reward for our labors during the planting time. Many of the earlier annuals and perennial plants are now in full bloom. Here we find the hardy buttercup, the sweet Williams and columbines. The lilacs, iris and peonies are followed by the wonderful roses, honeysuckles, and many others. Now is the time to thin out the plants in the annual borders, transplant zinnias, snapdragons, stocks, asters, cosmos, etc. Plant out all your winter flowering geraniums, fuchias, etc. Cuttings may now be taken and rooted in the sand box, or tiny pots of earth. Pinch plants back to promote branching, and rem.ove all buds, and your flowers for next winter are assured. Cut back your houseplants and repot into larger pots, using a mixture of one-third good soil, one-third sand, and one-third well-rotted manure. Set the pots out of doors in a partly shaded spot, water sparingly, and let them have a rest period during the hotter months of the year. One flower that should be grown in every home garden is the aster. The easiest way to grow asters is to sow the seed in an especially prepared bed. This can be done in late April or the early days of May. Asters will do well in any ordinary soil, but do best of all on sandy, mellow soil which has been well fertilized during the previous summer or autumn. If manure is added in spring, see to it that it is well rotted, for fresh fertilizer is certain death to asters. When the seedlings are about three inches high, transplant to permanent bed or border. Plant when JUNE MAGIC. 341 soil is moist but not wet, and have plants from ten to eighteen inches apart, according to variety; the tall, branching variety need more room. Cultivate deeply. Water thoroughly, but not too often. Asters do well in partial shade. When the flower buds have formed, a mulch of lawn clippings will help retain the moisture in the soil and prevent the opening flowers from being soiled by the storm. Asters usually find a good market as cut flowers, and for boquets and decorative pieces are especially prized, both for their wonderful range of colors and the length of time they will keep fresh in water. Full particulars as to varieties, time of blooming and culture may be found in any good flower catalog or garden guide. We can especially recommend the one issued by |\james Vicks Sons, Rochester, New York, who are aster specialists of international reputation, and whose flower and vegetable seeds are thoroughly reliable and moderate in prices. All spring bulbs, as hyacinths, tulips, etc., should now be dug up, dried, and put away ready for next fall's planting, and their places filled in with summer flowers. Lawns now require to be mowed weekly,and edgings trimmed nicely, and the flower beds hoed and raked after each shower or v/atering, for if weeds are not kept down as they first appear, double the labor will be required to eradicate them next month. Cuttings, or young plants of chrysanthmums, if started now, will give fine flowering plants for fall flowering.
