The result of any cataclysm such as the world has just passed through, necessarily leaves in its wake a vast trail of difficult problems and unsettled conditions. It is true that our own country has not been devastated as France and Belgium have been, nor have we approached the verge of bankruptcy, as perhaps England is doing. Yet the calling of 5,000,000 men from regular avenues of domestic and civil life, thrusting them into the preparation and conflict of war involves no light process of readjustment in order that these men shall be returned to social life without injury to themselves and their interests, and without loss to the people of the country. Moreover, the changing of manufacturing plants from the peaceable pursuits of ordinary life into institutions for the manufacture of strictly war materials, and vice versa, constitutes another problem in readjustment which statesmen must face. Added to this is the unbelievable increase of the credit system, which means that everybody is buying on credit ? for that is what paper money is? which has caused prices to soar beyond the wildest dream,s, while everybody clamors for lower prices on what is bought, yet all the workers want higher wages and salaries than has ever been earned in the history of the world. This reconstruction need is the foundation of our Fifth Liberty or Victory Loan, and there may be another in the future; while the vexing and difficult process of administering needed 362 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. relief to families robbed of their wage-earners, through war's necessities, and finding profitable jobs for returned soldiers, hangs like a threatening cloud over the heads of civic relief workers and public officials. Then there is the sex problem. Women have crowded by the hundreds of thousands into the ranks of the wage-earners, and they are very loth to go back into their homes and become a seeming burden on the shoulders of men. They have tasted the sweets of financial and social independence and in most instances refuse to return to old conditions. The biggest problem of all, that which contains the germ of world-suicide, is the dissatisfaction of the working classes everywhere with existing conditions. Labor is not satisfied with more wages and shorter hours. Men feel that the crux of the labor problem lies in the ownership of the producing industry. They find themeslves without power or influence in the matter of governing industries which they themselves create and continue. The human spirit, when released from the pressure of fear, rebels against any form of authority which is not delegated from itself; yet the masses of the people are the masses because they lack the initiative and creative governing.power to organize and control human and mechanical forces. The whole world, therefore, is whirling around in this vortex of confusion and dismay. It may well be that all the prophecies made concerning this people shall be fulfilled in a shorter period of time than we now realize. We have all the foundation of truth with the basic principles which underlie the government of the world. The reconstruction question with you and me, however, is an individual question. Always keep that in mind, my sisters. The people in this Church and kingdom are the Church and kingdom, as the citizens of this Government are the Government. No stream rises higher than its source, and the strength of the cham is its weakest link. Look well to your individual link, that it shall be strong, not corroded with evil passions, rusted with envy, nor ground upon by the friction of sordid ambition and the lust for the vain things of this world. This is the message of reconstruction for this people: learn to construct and adjust all your own life-forces so that you shall be ready, not to drive and force men into the true Church and kingdom of God. but to lead them by loving them, to win them by serving them. The gospel is the plan under heaven by which men can be saved.
