Mothers of Our Leaders
======================================================================

Mothers of Our Leaders SARAH FARR SMITH, Mother of Elder George Albert Smith. My mother was born in a Latter-day Saint home. She was a daughter of Lorin Farr and Amanda Chase, both being pioneer families. She passed through the experiences of pioneer life in such manner as to develop the best there is in a human being. She began life w^ith a strong physique and a cheerful disposition, thus entering into the struggle of existence with assurance of success. Her training made her exceedingly frugal and economical so that when, as a young girl, she married my father, John Henry Smith, she began home-making under the most favorable circumstances. My parents had no home of their own, and their few belongings were packed in a box. Father made some ot their furniture, and they began married life in a log house, with a mud roof. Mother was and is one of the most industrious women I ever knew. I well remember, when I was a child, how she was the first one up in the morning and the last one to bed at night. And during her experience of giving birth to eleven children and rearing eight of them to man and womanhood not one of us was ever neglected in any way. She was a strict disciplinarian, and we always knew that when she told us to do anything she meant it. She has had to economize most all of her life, and now, at nearly seventy years of age, she is perhaps more comfortably situated than ever before. Although we were very poor, and my father was on a mission when I was five years old, I never remember of hearing my mother complain, and I never saw her shed a tear because of conditions that surrounded her. She could make a dollar go as far as anybody I ever knew. She is a wonderful housekeeper, and during the rearing of her large family, she did not have much assistance from hired help. She is a great lover of beautiful things; she always kept her home properly, and in 314 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. good repair. She had a faculty of mending things with tin. If a mouse got into the cupboard, she found the hole, and the next time he paid a visit, he discovered his entrance barred with a piece of tin. She is a woman of remarkable endurance, and until after her last child was born I do not remember to have ever heard her say she was tired. She seemed to feel she had a certain amount of work to do and she proceeded to do it in the most rapid and painstaking manner. Although she was not able to attend meetings often, yet her children were always made ready for Sabbath School, and we were encouraged to attend to our duties in the Church in every possible way. No husband was ever more devotedly sustained by his helpmeet than my father was by my mother. She loved him with all her heart, and seemed to find the greatest possible pleasure in doing the thing that she knew would satisfy him. She retained her youth to the extent that when I was a young man we were taken for brother and sister. When father was absent from home on a mission, mother took his place, and she was really the head of the house in his absence. We attended to our prayers, and had a blessing on the food, and in case of sickness, she called in the elders, for she has great faith in the ordinances of the gospel. She has always been a strict tithe-payer, and as far as I have been able to discover, there has never entered her mind a thought that perhaps there might be a mistake and "Mormonism" not be true. She believes it with all her soul, and has sustained the authorities of the Church in every possible way. She always had a good word for all people, and it is a rare thing for her to speak in any other way than that of commendation of any soul. I never knew a more charitable woman, or one more willing to impart of what little she had to those who needed more than she. I know that many, many times she has given to others of her small substance and has gone without things that most people would have considered really important. Of course, I look upon her as a wonderful mother, and from the depth of my soul, I thank my heavenly Father that she is my mother. great care Her strictanyhonesty, to fulfil promisehermade, scrupulous truthfulness, was always and' her an inspiration to me. Like most mothers, she was slow to believe that her children could do anything that wasn't just right. But if an accusation was made, she went to the bottom of it before rendering a decision, and if her child was in the wrong, the child knew it had to make the matter right. Her strict determination to be just in all things has always had its effect upon me. She had a faculty of always presenting a neat appearance, no matter how ordinary her clothing might be, and she always looked well dressed. MOTHERS OF OUR LEADERS. 315 She gave her consent for father to marry Aunt Josephine, and was loyal to her and to her children in every way. They have lived the principle of plural marriage as well as any family I have ever seen, and the two have been like sisters and still are. Your brother, George Albert Smith. ANNA L. IVINS, Mother of Elder Anthony W. Ivins. My mother, Anna Lowrie Ivins, was the daughter of Caleb Ivins, Jr., and Edith Ridgway. She was born at Philadelphia, Nov. 18, 1816, and was a sister to Rachel Ridgway Ivins, the mother of Prest. Heber J. Grant. Caleb Ivins, Jr., was the son of Caleb Ivins and Sarah Wright. Caleb Ivins was the son of Moses Ivins and Kezia Shreve. My father, Israel Ivins, was the son of Anthony Ivins and Sarah Reeves Wallen. Anthony Ivins was the son of Israel Ivins and Margaret Woodward. Israel Ivins was the son of Moses Ivins and Kezia Shreve. It will be seen by the above that the grandparents (great-grandparents) of both father and mother were the same. Like many others who identified themselves with the Church at an early period, and came to Utah during the pioneer days, my parents found themselves in a new environment, and entirely different to that to which they had been accustomed. The families of both parents were well to do, they were merchants, manufacturers, and owners of large tracts of land in New Jersey, and adjoining states. My father was an engineer by profession. We were among the first settlers in the St. George valley, and in common with other pioneers of the Dixie country passed through the hardships incident to the development of that inhospitable region. The resources brought from the old home were soon exhausted, and we were reduced to a condition of poverty in strong contrast to our early life. The one thing which impressed me most in the character of my mother was, that during all of these experiences, of poverty and different family conditions from those to which she had been accustomed in her early life, she did not for a moment lose her patience, dignity, or self control. She was the same dignified, patient, pleasant woman under all circumstances. She did not at any time in my life inflict corporal punishment upon me, nor do I remember a word spoken in anger. Where correction was necessary it was administered in kindness and by reason, which never failed to leave a profound impression. 316 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. I never, at any time, heard her speak in anger to my father or any other member of the family. The debt of gratitude which I owe her has not, and cannot, be paid in this life, I hope that in eternity it may be. She was a convert to the divine mission of the prophet Joseph Smith, and a believer, without reservation, in the doctrines of the restored gospel. She lived in accordance with her profession of faith, and taught me, both by precept and example, to live a virtuous, honest life. That I have succeeded as well as I have is largely due to her teaching and example. Perhaps you can glean from the foregoing what you would like to have for the Magazine. With assurances of confidence and esteem I remain, Sincerely yours, A. W. IviNs. A
