The Paymaster Lucy S. Burnham
======================================================================

Paymaster. By Lucy S. Burnham. Teta stood in the open doorway, gazing with anxious eyes across the dreary stretch of desert land. As far as the eye could see, there stretched before her gaze, sand, hot, dazzHng sand. Teta was alarmed at the strange, new rebellion that filled her heart today,and a question as new and strange seemed to stand out in letters of fire before her weary brain. Had they been over-zealous in the work of the Lord that they had given their all for the gospel's sake? It was just before little Edith was born that Dwight had been called on his mission. How tender Dwight had been to her during the long, anxious time of waiting, and when the call had come he seemed stunned at the thought of leaving her to go down the valley of deep shadow, without him there to comfort and help her with his love. During the days that followed before his leaving, Teta often caught him looking at her with a gaze that was almost worshipful. She wondered now at the strange, new calm that had settled upon her as Dwight took her in his arms at parting, his face all white and drawn and the laughter all turned to pain in his big, blue eyes. How she ever endured the month that followed she never knew, but when her first born was laid in her arms, by her own dear mother, she took a new hold on life and was soon her old self again. She had seen all their hard savings dwindle away and even the little home, to which Dwight had taken her as a bride, sold that Dwight might fill his mission. Job's comforters there were, who told her plainly they had been silly to make such sacrifices, and that it was not required of any one to undergo such hardships, and she had very spiritedly replied: "Perhaps it is not necessary or required, yet if we do it willingly, I am sure God will accept and bless us for it. I am so glad for Dwight's sake, for he needed the experience so much." And yet today this question would gnaw at her vitals, for within the darkened room lay her baby, sick nigh unto death, for want of help, and she was alone in this desert. Pacing back and forth between the crib and the open door in her sleepless agony, as one in a dream, she lived over the past and what had brought them to this lonely place. On Dwight's return from his mission in the late fall, penniless, work was scarce, so he had accepted the first position offered him, that of foreman on a THE PAYMASTER. 329 big cattle ranch in northwestern New Mexico. He had not intended to take her with him. "It is too lonely a place, Teta," he had told her; "I will get along someway, and in the spring, perhaps, I can secure work nearer home." She had answered him out of a full heart: "Dwight, where you go I will go. Your home shall be my home." The winter had not been altogether bad. Dwight had worked hard during the day, but he was near her, and the long evenings together paid for all the day's loneliness. The summer which followed had been hot and dry, no rain falling, and the big stretches of meadow land were now only patches of hot, dry sand. Water was scarce, and the worried foreman and weary cowboys were in the saddle constantly trying to keep the roving, restless herd under control. ' At last the owner had decided it necessary to move the cattle, and yesterday Dwight had ridden with his cowboys on a round-up and had left Teta with only an Indian boy for company. Soon after he rode away little Edith had shown symptoms of illness. All day and all night Teta had applied her scanty remedies, but baby Edith steadily grew worse. Goaded to desperation but a few hours ago, she had sent the Indian boy to find Dwight. The desert and its loneliness had never seemed as terrible to her as now. Oh, if she could only get help of some kind! How she longed for her mother, or even the good old country doctor who had attended the people of her home town for years! She had never known his skill and his faith to fail. If she were only in her old home town! Had they then been truly unwise, and must they suffer for it now? A little moaning sound aroused her from her deep thought; giving the landscape one last hurried search, she flew inside to the cradle. A sharp pain pierced her heart as she noted the little flushed face and gasping breath of her baby. She must have help of some kind, and that soon, too. No tears came now, her eyes were dry and hard. This, then, was how they were to be paid for their sacrifice, foolishness ? call it what you would! To see her baby die and she alone, alone, indeed, if God was deaf to her cry. With a low, choking sob, she ran to the door, to take up her blinding search once more. This time was she to be rewarded? Or was she crazy? Had her mind become so intent on one thought, help, that her weary brain reproduced, in the distant haze, what she so desired to see? Wearily she brushed her hand across her eyes in an uncertain way, then fairly gasped. In the distance now could be,seen two human beings slowly approaching. It could not be Dwight and the Indian boy, for these two men were walking. The fretful voice of her baby was calling again. She bathed the little hot face. 330 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. soothed it as best she could, and then kneeling by the bed and burying her face in the pillow, she sobbed out her gratitude: "Oh, baby Edith, help is coming. God has not forsaken us!" Then in a repentant She arose mood she prayed, knees"Oh, and God, went forgive to the me, forgive." door. The men were very near now; she could not distinguish their features, but she could see they were respectable-looking men. One man carried a small grip. He kept changing it from hand to hand as he walked ? a gesture she knew so well as belonging to Dr. Lloyd, the one person she longed for most beside DWight. Could it possibly be he? He went often to Crown Point (an Indian agency) she knew. Nearer and nearer they came, and she bounded out to meet them, now recognizing him beyond a doubt. "Oh, Doctor Lloyd," she sobbed, "it was God who sent you here, I am sure." The doctor took both hands of the now hysterical girl, and added dryly: "I thought it was a broken-down machine, but maybe you are right. Be it as it may, I am glad I am here, if you need me. Is Dwight sick?" "No, no; it is baby Edith who is sick. Oh, doctor, she is dying, I tell you, dying." "Come, child," the doctor said kindly, "you must calm yourself. Ifthe baby is sick, she needs our best efforts at once." He led Teta into the house, and while she was bravely fighting for calm, he took off his dusty coat, opened his medical case, and then, as the examination went on, Teta told him of the baby's symptoms and all she had done for her. She had great confidence in the good old doctor. Of course, he could save Edith. Had he not done so time and again? "Pneumonia," the doctor told her, "you have done all any one could do, and now it is up to me, and I will do my best. Where is Dwight? I wish he were here." Teta told of Dwight's absence and how she had sent the boy for him. "I feel sure they will come soon," she added. Swiftly they worked, the doctor giving instructions and Teta calmly carrying them out. The afternoon faded away, the sun sank to rest beyond the low hills, twilight came and slowly the darkness settled round about them. In a quiet room, lighted by a single coal-oil lamp, the doctor and Teta sat on either side of the little bed watching the life of the little sufferer slowly ebb away. Teta was strangely white and quiet. She seemed stupified bv what she saw in the countenance of her child. She had' such confidence in the doctor's ability, now even that had failed her. THE PAYMASTER. 331 Oh, if only Dwight would come. He seemed her one hope now. It would be terrible to have him come home and find the little girl he loved cold and still forever. "Oh, Dwight," she murmured aloud, "come, come," and as if in answer to her cry, the sound of a galloping horse was heard. Nearer and nearer it came. A man's voice was heard, sharp and quick, a clink of spurs and Dwight stood in the doorway, his big, stalwart bulk filling the opening. For one moment he stood, while his eyes took in the two silent watchers and the white, spent form of his baby girl in the cradle. The laugh slowly faded from his eyes, leaving only a dumb questioning. He seemed robbed of power of speech or movement. Then Teta with a little moaning gesture held out her hands tr'wards him, and in one bound he was kneeling beside her, calling out his baby's name in low, broken tones. At the sound the little eyelids fluttered and opened, but the blue eyes so like his own, were blurred with delirium. Dwight took his now sobbing wife in his arms, and over her bowed head he looked squarely into the eyes of the doctor with a mute appeal. The doctor winced as he slowly shook his head in answer. Dwight understood, and rising to his feet, he walked with unsteady step to the door. He must have one moment alone, under the stars, to steady him,self. The suddenness of the blow seemed to crush him. The Indian boy had told him the child was sick, but to find her thus ? The doctor followed him from the room, leaving Teta still sobbing by the bed. He went directly to the young father who stood in the stable, bowed in grief like an old man. Dwight turned sharply at the footsteps, but before he could speak the doctor was addressing him in low fatherly tones. "Dwight, my boy, you must brace up for your wife's sake. She has endured so much, I really fear for her. I cannot keep from you the fact that your baby is dying now. I would give my right arm if I could save her for you, Dwight, but I can do no more, and we must think of Teta now." The doctor, forgetting the open door, had spoken louder than he knew, and Teta, kneeling by the bed, had heard every word. Like one suddenly awakened, she lifted her head, and slowly but surely the faith that had been dormant for hours came to life. Dwight's voice came to her now, low and broken: "Please allow me one moment to myself, doctor, and I will be strong." "It is all so sudden. My baby, oh, my baby," he was sobbing now as only a strong man may. What was the matter with Dwight? cried the mother-heart. 332 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. It was not like him to give up so. Was he going to let their baby die without an effort to save her? And she had counted so on him. All her fighting blood was up now, a mother fighting for her young. With a low cry she ran to the door and the doctor and Dwight turned at her cry. But this was not the Teta they had left, this woman with head held high, and in her eyes the light of unflinching faith. "Dwight, doctor," she said, and her voice was low and calm, "what are you talking about? My baby is not going to die.""Oh, my husband," she said, as she came near and put two strong arms about his neck, "where is your faith? Is it sleeping as mine has been? Dwight," her pleading toney cut the silence, "have you forgotten the wonderful gift of healing you were blessed with while on your mission? Wake up, my husband, wake up. Surely, dear, when your faith availed so much for others, you can exercise it now for our own precious child." She lifted her eager eyes to his, and as she did so he shook himself as if to get rid of some gripping power. "You are right, Teta, I was sleeping. Come, doctor," he added, "you will come with us and we will ask the help of the greatest physician of all." He kissed Teta as reverently as one would a saint, and still holding her hand he walked with a firm, steady step into the house. He took a bottle of consecrated oil from a shelf near the door and said, "Come, we will pray for our baby." Pouring some of the holy oil upon the crown of her head, he anointed her in the name of Jesus Christ, and then sealing the anointing, he prayed, as the astonished doctor, now kneeling near Teta, had never heard any one pray before. The pleading voice filled the room. This man was not praying to a spirit, a Father of doubtful personage, a God without body, parts or passions, everywhere and yet nowhere present. Oh, no! Dwight was praying as if he were face to face with a Father who was very near, and ready and able to bless his children. A new wonder began to dawn in the doctor's heart, a new respect for the strange pepole called "Mormons." After all, could it be possible they were right in their strange views of God? When, in earnest tones, Dwight finished his prayer, the doctor's "Amen" was as earnest as Teta's, and still they knelt in silence. Not one sound could be heard but the ticking of the clock and the labored breathing of the baby. A moment passed and the breathing seemed to be growing less difficult. The three bowed heads were raised in wonder to see the little eyes wide open. THE PAYMASTER. 333 Two little arms reached for Dwight's neck, butt fell helpless, from weakness, upon her little breast; and a voice so weak, the big boy bending over her could scarcely hear, as she murmured, "Daddy." The doctor took the little hands in his and, to his joy, found the little pulse growing stronger. He put his hand upon her brow and found it moist. Turning to the still kneeling father and mother, he said, "Lo, a miracle has been performed. Your child will live. All she needs now is good care and a continuation of your great faith." The next morning, just as the sun came peeping over the hill, flooding the world with its glory, the doctor came into the room to find Teta and Dwight kneeling by the baby sound asleep. The baby was sleeping sweetly. Dwight lay near the baby, his hands still upon her head as if in prayer. Fearful that he would yet lose her, he had knelt with his hands upon her head until, from sheer exhaustion, he had fallen asleep. The sunbeams at the window sill lit up the scene and glorified the bronze and golden head, so near each other, as if in benediction. The doctor turned to go, but two heads came up in alarm, and the movement awakened the baby. Putting out one little hand she said, "Daddy, Edie hungry." An hour later, as the doctor was leaving, he took Dwight's hand in evident embarrassment and said, "Dwight, I am going home to read that Book of Mormon you gave me so long ago; and if you will give me more information on your gospel I will promise to read and consider it." With a hearty handshake the doctor and Dwight parted, Dwight to wonder at the doctor's words and the doctor to wonder at his new experience. When they were once more alone, Teta confided to Dwight all her bitter rebellion and strange questioning, adding, "Oh, I feel so chastened, so ashamed, I wonder if God can forgive me." "Of course, he can, and already has forgiven you, dear, for you were not to blame. It was terrible for you to be alone with baby so sick, and I will not chance it happening again. I will send you in to stay with your mother until the round-up is over, and move." "Dwight took his wife tenderly in his arms as he spoke. "No, Dwight," Teta replied, "there is no need of your going to all that trouble and expense, for I will not doubt my heavenly Father again. I have had my lesson. He gave to us what no one else could have done. He gave us our baby's life. Surely God is a good paymaster, and he that giveth his time and means to his service, shall some day be paid in full."
