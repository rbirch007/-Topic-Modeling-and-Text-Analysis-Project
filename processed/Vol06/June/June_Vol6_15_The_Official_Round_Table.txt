The Official Round Table
======================================================================

OFFICIAL ROUND TABLE. 349 Have yon ever noticed the trifling, and sometimes the apparently important things which arise to prevent us from attending our Relief Society meetings? If one wants, a.dozen different excuses can be made, and absence from meeting seems legitimate and necessary. The little domestic difficulties which arise ? the social calls, the ringing of the telephone, a slight misunderstanding with some other member of the Society which makes us rather unwilling to face our neighbor ? all these things too often arrive and prevent our members from attending meeting. Do not be kept out of heaven by trifles nor by your enemies. Make your enemies your friencls; control the circumstances about you and rise up in the dignity of your womanhood and be a true Relief Society woman. The conduct of our business meetings in the Relief Society ia a subject of considerable importance to the members thereof. Let us suggest to officers and teachers that when they gather in their business meetings order shall obtain. Chatter and laughter are excellent antidotes to care and trouble, but they have no place in the regular and ordained meetings of the Society. Confusion results where two people talk at the same time, and no matter how harmless the exchange of neighborly gossip may be, the Relief Society meeting is not the place for it. We suggest that perfect and quiet discipline shall mark the conduct of all our ReHef Society gatherings. NOTES FROM THE FIELD. Hyrum Stake. Mrs. Sophia Christensen of Hyrum Stake, although 78 years of age, and partly crippled with rheumatism, knitted last year over 58 pairs of socks, two sweaters and 17 large blocks to be used in the Red Cross quilts. Another member of this ward knitted 26 sweaters. To stimulate an interest in knitting, Mrs. H P. Nielsen, Chairman of the Red Cross knitting in the Third Ward, instituted knitting parties which were very successful. Benson Stake. Seven thousand bushels of wheat was turned over to the government from Benson Stake. During the past year the teachers have made 100 per cent visits. All ward presidents attend sacrament meetings regularly. One of the Stake Board members who took a course in Child Welfare under Miss Ravenhill of the A. C. has had charge 350 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. of the Child Welfare work in the stake. She has given three lectures in each ward on this subject. Bannock Stake. On September 7, 1918, Mrs. Gwen H. Redford was released as president of the Relief Society of the Bannock stake. She resigned her po,sition because of the fact that she had moved to Logan to place her children in school. Although she had held this position only a few years her splendid work in the Relief Society was already bearing fruit. Mrs. Redford is a capable, piogressive, well trained woman, deeply spiritual and a student of the gospel. She will be greatly missed by Relief Society workers in the Bannock stake. Mrs. Minnie Sorenson of Lago, Idaho, was appointed to succeed Mrs. Redford. We are pleased to welcome Mrs. Sorenson in our group of Stake Presidents and feel sure that she will be able to carry on the good work so well begun in her stake. Japan Mission. The following interesting letter has just been received from Joseph H. Stimpson, president of the Japan Mission: For some time we have been trying to get a Relief Society started among the women of this land but it seems impossible at the present to effect such an organization. We wrote to you about this a long time ago, and Sister Stimpson was appointed to take charge of that work, but the small number of women now attending our meetings, and especially the few women saints, have made it impossible to even get the organization completed. Women in Japan have very few rights, if we speak from the woman's rights point of view, as known in America. They are not even able to go and come where they wish. So we are sorry to state that as yet we have not been able to get enough together to hold a meeting. I am sorry we are not able to make a better report, but we have not given up hopes that conditions will be such that we may get started sometime. However, lately we have done a little in the line of genealogical work. Some of the saints are starting to get their genealogies collected. I have helped in the arrangement of this data in logical order and find it very interesting. It is hard to follow out the family, often because men as well as women change their names at marriage and adoptions are so common that it is difficult to keep the family lines straight. I find the work very interesting, though, and hope to get more done in the near future. The Relief Society Magazine is very welcome in our midst. We thank you very much for sending it to the mission and we feel that with it you are filling a place not reached by any other publication, and desire to congratulate you on your success.

The Plain Tailored Skirt. The materials suitable for tailored skirts are the heavy woolen materials such as serges, broadcloth, etc. It is useless to try to make a tailored skirt from a cotton serge, or other.similar materials, as cotton does not require tailoring. So the directions here given for making a plain skirt are only to be applied to the all-wool materials. In making the selection and purchase of material, first of all make sure you are buying woolen material. As to color, the conservative woman will select a quiet color which will be in good taste for street wear and all occasions appropriate for the wearing of tailored clothes. Quiet colors are more practical in their combination with different colored waists. For the ordinary home dress-maker, plain materials will be more easily laundered than checks, plaids or stripes, unless the figure is very small. The colors I consider most practical for a tailored skirt are, navy blue, greys, browns and black. After careful selection, find out if the material has been shrunk. If not, you must either shrink it or have it done. To shrink it, press it on the wrong side, using a heavy, damp cloth, and allow the material to remain in place on the board until the steam from the cloth thoroughly penetrates. Shrinking will lessen the gloss or finish on broadcoth and similar materials, but all things being considered, it is wisest in the long run. Next, the style must be considered. The styles change less in tailored clothing than they do in other types, and are invariably plain. In this article we will consider the making of the two-piece skirt with little fulness in the back, as that seems to be the most favored style this season. The amount of material required will vary with the size of the person to be fitted, the width of material and the style selected. A medium-sized or small person will require twice the length (allowing about six inches extra for curving at the top
