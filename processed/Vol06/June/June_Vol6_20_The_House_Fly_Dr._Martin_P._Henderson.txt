House Fly. Dr. Martin P. Henderson, Professor of Biology, B. Y. University, Provo. (This takes place of Guide Work for July.) The fly is too cosmopolitan to require introduction, but in common with many other individuals often encountered in "polite society," it will probably be the less appreciated the more its history and habits are understood. Of the various kinds of flies commonly found in houses but one really deserves the name of "house-fly," the entire number. since it represents rather more than 95 per cent of A careful examination of its body reveals the fact that it could hardly have been better designed for the role of filth distributor. The head is composed mainly of two large compound eyes. These at first appear to be smooth but closer observation proves them to be dotted with myriads of fine hairs. In front, between the eyes are the antennae, the last joint of which bears a short feathery brush. Other parts of the head are provided with bristle-like hairs of varying lengths. From the under side of the head arises the proboscis. This is an elongated, fleshy tube covered with hairs on the exterior and expanded at the tip into two broad membranous lobes provided with many fine corrugated ridges. This structure is admirably fitted for sucking, and through it food is taken in a liquid or semi-liquid form. When hard substances, such as sugar, are to be taken up they are first moistened and dissolved "with vomit which is regurgitated from the crop" laden with germs and filth which have previously been sucked up. The body is densely covered with bristles and hairs of varying lengths, ,so arranged that they carry with them large quantities of any dirt or germs encountered. The wings, although apparently bare, have a very dense covering of fine hairs admirably suited to the collection of germs and filth. The legs are provided with bristles arranged in rows and interspersed with denser mats of fine, short hairs. The last joint of the foot bears at its tip two large curved claws and a pair of sponge-like pads from which project myriads of glandular hairs which secrete a substance by means of which the fly adheres to polished surfaces, a most admirable provision also for the collection and distribution of any kind of foul matter encountered. The fly's breeding habits likewise fit it for the role of filth distributor. Its eggs are laid in filth, the larvae or maggots wallow in filth, the pupae spend their "sleeping" period in filth, and the adults emerge laden with filth to begin their duties in a near THE HOUSE ELY. 367 by household. Horse manure appears to be the favorite larval food, but when this is not immediately available it does not hesitate to appropriate to its needs any corrupt mass of organic material. It has been observed to breed in pig-, cow and chicken manure, in human excrement, in dirty waste paper, decaying vegetation, putrifying meat, slaughter-house refuse, sawdust sweepings, slops, fermenting vegetable materials, such as spent hops, bran and ensilage, and in rotting potatoes. The rate at which flies increase is astounding. A female deposits an average of one hundred twenty eggs at one time, and will produce at least two, and frequently four, such batches between April and September. In twelve to fifteen days the new a-dult generation is also ready to lay eggs so that ten to twelve generations may result from a single individual during a season. It has been estimated that the progeny of one female under favorable conditions would amount to hundreds of billions in a summer. The omnivorous habits of the "house-fly" are matters of every day observation. It has a keen,sense of smell without any sense of decency ? so is attracted alike by the delicate odors from the kitchen and the foul-smelling stenches arising from putrefying organic wastes. It does not hesitate to eat its fill from and wallow its body in the filthiest germ-laden mass, and then at first opportunity to plunge its reeking feet and "snout" into the most delicious cream cake on the pantry shelf. It will feed ravenously on excreted wastes of the typhoid patient, suck up with avidity the sputum from a tuberculous individual, wallow in the pus of an open sore, and then pass directly to any food upon the table, to the nipple of baby's bottle, to healthy mucus membranes or uncontaminated wounds. "There is nothing to tell whether the fly that comes blithely up to sup with you is merely unclean, or whether it has just finished feeding upon dejecta teeming with typhoid bacilli." That the fly is a distributor par excellence of all kinds of filth and disease germs, has long since passed the stage of experimental demonstration. It has been repeatedly examined not only for.surface contamination, but also as to the number of germs that may be carried in the digestive tract. The number of surface forms on a single fly has been known to vary from about five hundred to more than six millions, and those of the digestive tract from one hundred to more than three millions. The number of germs carried varies with the season and the quantity of exposed filth of the district in which the flies are collected, in fact the quantity of filth carried by the flies as well as the number of flies in any locality seems to bear a definite relation to the habits of the people and to the conditions of their surroundings. In one experiment in which the fly was permitted to fall into a vessel of sterile 368. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. water and swim about for several minutes ? just as sometimes occurs in many households ? the number of surface germs washed off was five hundred million, and those from the digestive tract over three hundred million. This perhaps represents extremes as to number of germs, but it is often repeated as to the bath, except that milk serves as the medium and an unsuspecting child as the incubator. As to specific germs of disease, the evidence is no leas certain and convincing. Flies fed on material cantaminated with the typhoid bacillus have been found to.distribute this germ in their feces for two days after feeding. From flies naturally infected, this germ has also been repeatedly recovered, so we know that the typhoid bacillus is carried not only accidentally on the surface of the insect's body but within its alimentary canal. Similar results have been reached in experiments with other disease germs, notably that of tuberculous, and there is abundant evidence that infantile diarrhea, dysentery and cholera may be so spread. Consider the possibilities of the fly coming in contact with these germs in nature. Typhoid bacilli are abundant in the excrement and urine of the person suffering from the disease, and are often in the dejecta for months or even years after the individual has recovered. Human excreta is very attractive to flies both for feeding and egg-laying. It is frequently carelessly exposed in waste places or open privies and left to contaminate myriads of insects not only with typhoid bacilli but with the germs of other intestinal diseases. The sputum of tubercular individuals is also greedily devoured by flies, and they have been shown to distribute the germ for several days after feeding on infected material. The fly, then, is most admirably adapted in bodily construction, breeding habits and life activities, to the nefarious practice of filth and disease distribution. But is the fly to blame? Is it not merely responding to environment in the only way in which nature permits it to respond, and incidentally turning back upon man the natural results of his own unclean habits? "O My Father."
