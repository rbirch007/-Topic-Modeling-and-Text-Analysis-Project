History of Instrumental Music. Brigham Cecil Gates. Instrumental music is probably nearly as old as vocal music. A baby delights in making rythmic sounds with his pounding hammer on a convenient tin pan or wooden board. Drums are so ancient that we have no record as to when they came into existence. The bird-cries and the twittering melodies were soon imitated by the shepherd on the banks of a river who blew his notes into the reed and learned that various sizes and lengths of reeds made various sounds. The assembly of various sizes of 'reeds, made from hard woods, constituted the first organ and man soon learned that the pipes could be handled through a key-board and bellows instead of blown upon in turn with his own lips. Flutes and modified instruments grew out of this primary discovery. The horns of animals furnished suggestions for the blasts of trumpets, while conch-shells, on the sea shore, were used by savages for similar purposes. Bows and arrows furnished the suggestion for the first stringed harps. The twang of the bow differed in sound from its thickness and length and thus taught the early descendants of Cain how to fasten gut strings in varying lengths and thicknesses across a wooden frame. Thus the first lute was made. Harps and, in very modern centuries, violins are the natural outgrowths of these discoveries. Annette Hullah in A Little History of Music, says: "Anybody can make an instrument something like Hermes' lute. A small wooden case does quite well for a sound-box, and if you have gut strings instead of fibre or a thong, as some savages do, it will give quite a good sound. Some of the early instruments of this kind had no box, but a soundboard underneath the strings, with a little bridge under them to prevent them touching the wood, but the sounds are not nearly so loud as when there is a box, because the sound-waves are dispersed instead of being collected." A piano, which is less than 200 years old, is only a harp laid flat, while a violin, not much older in point of discovery, is merely a string box with a handle added and a cover put on. Instruments are divided into three classes: percussion instruments, which are struck; stringed instruments, those which are plucked or bowed; wind instruments, those which are blown. The Chinese like things they can bang, and have bells, slabs of wood and slices of bamboo all arranged in rows on a frame, to be hit with a hammer. They have many varieties of flutes and 336 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. drums and trumpets: The Hinndus used drums, bag-pipes, cymbals and trumpets. The Hebrews loved the lyre and harp, while they had also cymbals and drums. The Egyptians and Assyrians used all of these instruments, only the Egyptians made them longer and noisier than anybody else. The Greeks refined their music and had flutes, trumpets, pan-pipes, cymbals and small drums. They developed a system of music writing, but they used their alphabet instead of any other note. They had time and rhythm marks for instrumental music, but none for their songs as the singer followed the words of the poems, making each note lasting as long as the syllable. The Romans liked noisier music than the Greeks. They used noisy instruments such as trumpets, cymbals, gongs, castanets, bells and bag-pipes, scorning the soft Greek instruments as not fit for fighting men. Their music was mostly martial music There was a very powerful musical guild in Rome with special privileges in the temple of Jupiter, and once, when the Roman senate took away their temple privileges, the entire guild went on strike and left the city. The senators had to send a special embassy to beg them to come back, for no entertainments could be given without them, and the priests could not conduct their services. The Romans preferred orchestras or an assemblage of players rather than solos and solo players. The tyrant Nero, however, was so proud of his singing voice and his fiddling gifts that he would sit up all night practicing the odes he was going to sing in public. He used to lie on the floor every day and do breathing exercises, with a chunk of lead across his waist to make him breathe from the diaphram. He naturally won all the musical prizes. One day an organ was sent him by a Greek inventor, different from any he had ever seen, and while he was unpacking it and trying it, his legions revolted and Rome burned. Perhaps the Welsh people had the earliest music in Europe, that is the Celts; but the Teutons were also fond of music and had their crude instruments and sang their warlike songs. In Rome the Christians had been meeting in the catacombs, singing their hymns and psalms together. When Christianity became popular, the Christians refused to adopt the pagan music about them, and so there was a great sameness in their church singing. We do not know whether the early Christian music was taken from the Romans, Hebrews, or Greeks, but we do know that they sang their hymms and chanjts alternately, because Pliny, who lived 112 years after the Christian Era, writes about their music. When Constantine, in the fourth century, made the Christian religion popular, flne churches were built, with large choirs, and the priests took over the singing altogether. HISTORY OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC. 337 In the beginning of the fifth century a bishop named Ambrose, in Milan, did a great deal for music. He shortened the chants, made new ones, wrote cheerful music and had his singers practice hard, adding to their voices the organ and lyre. However, even these singers sang only one note to each syllable, so that everyone could hear what was said. Over in Rome they sang two or three notes to each syllable, so that one word had a whole string of notes sung with it. This was called the Gregorian style or fashion, after Pope Gregory. There was a great deal of contention over these two methods, and for many centuries Charlemagne (King of the Franks 800-814) the Great, was as fine a musician as he was a soldier. He played the lute, composed songs and had singing taught in all the schools as one of the fixed studies. He himself went about in his travels through the schools and churches correcting, advising and encouraging music. He introduced organs from Constantinople, where they were made in his day. The mediaeval monks introduced harmony, using fourths and fifths, but the parts were all the same length, just the same quantity of notes in each and lasting the same time. A monk named Guido Arezzo, in 1020, invented the syllables to sing by, although they used only what we would call the white notes on the piano, and their school was different from ours. The evolution of the violin took place in the 17th century. Some say it came from the Welch crwth and some think it evolved from oriental lutes, but certain it is that the violin, as we know it today, developed rapidly and culminated sharply in 1611 at Cremona, Italy. The Amati family and Stradivari, who died in 1737, made the most renowned and perfect violins known to history. Even modern art has not equalled, much less surpassed, these wonderful and rare violins. Many instruments grew out of the little fiddle: little viols and big viols, some with long necks, some with short, some round, some flat, others with large curves and some with small. The next wonderful instrument evolved in these modern times is the piano. The organ itself had a natural evolutionary process from pipes and reeds, while the piano is simply a harp laid down in a box. The earliest piano was called the spinet; then came the harpsichord, used as early as the 16th century but associated with the organ until the 17th century. In the 18th century Paris and London had excellent manufactories of good harpsichords. The pianoforte is essentially a keyboard-dulcimer. It was not, however, before 1800 that the pianoforte began to take the place of the harpsichord and these were exceedingly small and confined as to keys and action. And not until the middle of the last century were there pianos such as we now use. Erard, in 1831. invented the repeating action and made a 338 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. grand piano. The organ, too, although of ancient manufacture, was not known in its present splendid condition until the recent centuries. The last hundred years has seen wonderful growth and development in all musical instruments. MUSIC IN CHURCH AND RELIEF SOCIETY SERVICE. We know that music has formed a great part of divine worship, from the creation of this earth, as doubtless it does in the worlds beyond this life. All intelligent Latter-day Saints should learn some primary facts concerning the history of music, and its value to us as a people, and they should acquaint themselves with the foundation principles of vocal and instrumental music. Music has developed as rapidly in the last hundred years as science or education have. The complex and intricate forms and modes of music known today require years of study and application to understand, much more to produce. However, there is no reason why all women in the Relief Society should not know a few of the elements of good music and how to enjoy that which they hear. Harmony is, musically speaking, a just adaptation of parts to each other in musical concord. We know that our Father in heaven loves harmony. We should see that all our children are trained to have an accurate sense of time and tune, even if tkey do not inherit it. The ear of the natural msuician is as greatly pained by discords in music as he would be by listening to people quarrel. Some voices sing a little off pitch, either too flat or too sharp, especially too flat. Such singers are an abomination in a choir, especially if the voice be strong and dominating. When music began to develop and was divided, in the middle ages, into sacred and secular music, the church music was very slow, with prolonged notes and few but swelling chords; while the secular music was gay and cheerful, with tripping notes and trilling cadences which expressed merriment and pleasure. The first attempt at writing opera music took cognizance of these facts, and the music was written in tripping measures, enriched with trills and rulades for the principal singers, while the music in the churches remained quiet and soft, delivered in slow time and with careful emphasis. It was supposed that in this way religious people expressed their worship of God, for they imagined ordinary human emotions, such as laughter and gaiety, with birds singing and the breeze playing, could not be expressed properly in church music. Even today this distinction is kept with more or less clearness. A very potent union of emotion or feeling is expressed through the words which accompany the music. Indeed, the muHISTORY OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC. 339 sician usually has a set of words to which he composes his music, suiting the strains and harmonies he devised to fit the meaning of the words which are before him. Note the martial music composed by Elder George Careless for the words, "Hark, listen to the trumpeters." Observe, also, the pathos of that lovely music which he wrote for Henry W. Naisbitt'.s funeral poem, "Rest for the weary soul." This thought suggests suitability in choice of music which the choir leader should study, and adapt her music to the time and the occasion. Love songs do not fit in well at religious assemblies, nor do rollicking instrumental pieces belong on our religious programs. If you are to have a special service for Anniversary Day, or Christmas, or Easter time, see that your choice of music fits in with the spirit of the occasion. Melody is as susceptible of variety and chang'~ as our human emotions are, or as are the songs of birds and bees and waves. Now, when harmony is added, and there are chords of music developed, these add infinite sources of variety and change, the combinations are infinite, and almost an inconceivable number of composers exist toda,^ writing so-called new melodies and devising new combinations of harmonic chords and accompaniments. We hear people speak of classical music and romantic music, of good music and poor music. Just what they mean is difficult for the ordinary person to understand. An ordinary definition would be that classical, or good music, never tires those who hear it, while cheap and poor music soon wearies and bores the hearers. Yet all music serves a purpose in life, and adds to its enjoyment, quieting the nervous, stilling the evil impulses, and developing within a love of God, nature, and man. As an example of classical music united to beautiful words we have: "Rest on the hillside, rest," by our two home authors, Henry W. Nai.sbitt and George Careless; "Come, thou glorious day of promise," also by home authors, Alexander Neibaur and A. C. Smyth; "O awake, my slumbering minstrel," by Eliza R. Snow and Evan Stephens. As an example of cheap and poor music we have such ballads as: "Smiles," "I'll say she does," and "Wee, wee, Marie."
