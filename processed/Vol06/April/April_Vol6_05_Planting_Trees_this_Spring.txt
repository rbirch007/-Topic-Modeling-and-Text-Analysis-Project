Planting Trees this Spring

Planting Trees This Spring. Morag. "I will.singof the bounty of the big trees, They are the green tents of the Almighty. He hath set them up for comfort and for shelter. "He that planteth a tree is a servant of God, He provi'deth a kindness for many generations, And faces that he hath not seen shall bless him." — Henry Van Dyke. One of our American holidays that is growing more popular every year is Arbor Day, or tree-planting day. It should be celebrated in every community throughout this land of ours. The government and state officials advise us each year to plant trees, and more trees, to add to the beauty and attractiveness of our towns and public highways. Trees in the garden and about the home place will not only provide us with fruit and so help reduce our living expenses, but will also enrich the soul, lend interest and color to life, and kindle a new community pride in those who live amongst and beneath them. Trees planted on our mountain sides, will save the soil from destructive erosion, our valleys from floods, and our wells and springs from serious shortage during the dry months of the year. It has been suggested that memorial trees be planted in honor of our fallen heroes who will not come back. Truly this would be a splendid way to keep their memory "green." Another plan is to plant birthday trees. We are also advised to plant peace trees. Let; there be a peace, indeed, and let us commemorate it by planting more trees in God's great out-of-doors. Parley J. Hill, our State Horticulturist, advises us to plant the elm, ash and sycamore; others might be the linden, beech, native and English walnut, chestnut, European mountain ash, and evergreen.

The Garden in April. Plants growing in greenhouse, cold frame, or windows, will require increased ventilation and water this month, as they wih be growing rapidly. Shift house plants into larger pots, if necessary. Plant seeds of the hardy vegetables, as beets, cauliflower, lettuce, spinach, peas, parsnips, chard^ radishes, turnips and onions. Thin out the cabbage, tomato, eggplant, etc., in the hot bed. If plants are crowded they will grow spindling and weak. Remove all covering from the asparagus bed and hoe or dig lightly. The same applies to rhubarb and strawberries, but be reasonably sure that danger from frost is all over. The planting of all hardy shrubs, bushes, climbers and herbaceous perennials, may now be done in the flower garden. Shrubs, which should find a place in every garden, are hawthorn (red and white), lilac, laburnum, spireas, bridal wreath, syringas, flowering almond, snowballs, honeysuckle, hydrangeas, altheas (rose of Sharon) ; climbers include, ampelopsis (Virginia creepers and Boston ivy), English ivy, honeysuckle, trumpet vine, wisteria, clematis, and the various climbing and rambler roses. Chrysanthemum roots may be divided and cuttings taken; these, if properly cared for, will produce splendid blooming plants by fall. Some perennials which are not so well known are: foxglove, perennial candvtuft, lupin, phlox, .scarlet lichen, forget-me-not. 224 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. cowslip, Woodruff valerian, tritoma (red hot poker), pyrethrum, and others. All of these are of easy culture and perfectly hardy and once established will quickly spread, last for years and become as popular as golden glow, coreopsis, etc. All may be grown from seed, but quicker success is assured by root division. Plant the seeds of all hardy annuals this month in the open ground. The soil should be enriched by fertilizer, thoroughly dug and raked level and smooth. Seed is usually sown in rows from six to twenty-four inches apart. Very fine seed, such as petunias and poppies, should be mixed with a little fine sand before sowing. After seed is sown, sift over it a little fine soil sufficient to covei" the seeds, lighter or heavier, according to the size of the seeds, and then smooth over with a board or back of the spade. Label the rows and carefully pull weeds. After the plants come up, they should be thinned out, leaving the stronger plants. Provide support, if necessary. Gladioli may be planted now. With a sharp pointed stick make a hole about six inches deep and plant bulb (right side up) at the bottom, fill with earth. Plant six or eight bulbs in a group, or in rows for a background. Gladioli may be planted every two weeks until the middle of July, if a succession of flowers are desired. Separate dahlia bulbs and be sure to leave a portion of the stem with each clump, or the bulbs will not produce shoots and flowers. Dahlias need plenty of room and should be cared for like the potato. Cuttings from geraniums, marguerites, fibrous begonias, etc., should be taken and placed in the sand box or a corner of the cold frame, where they can make roots and be ready for the window boxes, or ornamental beds, when they are needed, about June. For a small garden, where there are no trees or bushes, plant castor oil bean and tall sunflowers. These will grow tall and provide some quick shade and quite a tropical effect, especially if you grow datura, colens, cannae, Joseph's coat, and other plants with highly colored ornamental leaves.
