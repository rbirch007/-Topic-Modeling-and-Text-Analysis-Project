Our Indian Cousins
======================================================================

Our Indian Cousins Our Lamanite sisters on the Catawba Indian Reservation are imbued with the spirit of Relief Society work. In addition to other good works they have purchased an individual sacrament set, and have donated also to the Red Cross. They are spiritualminded, and their faith forms a strong bond between them and the Lord. Recently, Sister Grace E. Callis visited this Relief Society. She was welcomed with much joy by these devoted women. CATAWBA RELIEF SOCIETY OFFICERS. A local newspaper paid the following well deserved tribute to the war activities of the Indian Relief Society members: "the INDIAN WOMEN SHOWING THEIR LOYALTY. "The women of the Catawba Indian Reservation are showing their loyalty to their country by doing knitting for the Red Cross and rendering any service they can. "On Saturday morning they brought in $8.00 in cash that had been raised by the Relief Society of the Church of Latterday Saints at that place, and turned it over to the local Red Cross chapter. "There are four boys from the Reservation now in service. 219 OUR INDIAN COUSINS. with one or more already in France.

The following excellent letter has just been received from Elder Wood, Apia. Samoa: I noticed in one of the recent issue of the Relief Society Maga::'ine accounts of the work being done in the islands and other far-away missions and I felt very sorry that there was nothing about Samoa. I decided then and there that I would write you and let you know what we are doing; that you all may know — even if we are small and insignificant in the eyes of the big world — that Samoa is "on the map." I am herewith taking the liberty of enclosing a picture of the Upolu Conference Relief Society, taken at our last October conference. The picture was taken at the adjournment of the Relief Society session, v.'hich was held in the large tin-roof house in the back-ground. The meeting of the sisters is the last, the longest, and generally proclaimed the best of all our conference sessions. Unlike many of our good sisters at home, these staunch Saints of the gentler sex delight in preaching and often feel slighted when not called upon. W'e have a fine native sister. Mrs. David Fiauu Kenison. at 220 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. the head of the organization on this island. She spent twelve years in the colony of losepa, in western Utah, and talks English very well. She came down here "chuck full' of ideas of the way we do things at home, and she certainly makes use of them. She, together with her two able assistants, Viga and Lupe, make a strong head in leading and encouraging their sisters. We have six organized branches of the Relief Society on this island of Upolu, besides several small ones not fully organized, with an enrollment of about seventy-five members. The work is also established on the other two islands of Tutuila and Savaii. Meetings are held weekly in each branch, and in addition the sisters meet one day a week in the larger branches to work. They weave mats, visit the sick, help to thatch houses, and work in their taro patches. The mats are sold, and contract work done in the various pursuits enumerated above, in order to raise funds to help along the work of the Relief Society. Recently one branch donated £12, (sixty dollars) to help buy an organ for their chapel. The President, Fiauu, has also started "basket parties" like we have at home. All the women and girls in the villages make little baskets and bring them filled with lunch. The men and boys then buy them for a shilling (25c) apiece. This idea was entirely new to the natives, but they seem to enjoy the parties immensely. As much as $25 has been collected at one such party. This money is used to help the poor and needy and to furnish the missionaries' homes. The sisters of one branch (Sauniatu) are now planning to buy a community medicine chest. They are in hopes also of doing something to help out the great work caused by the war. UPOLU RELIEF SOCIETY SAMOA N MISSION. OUR INDIAN COUSINS. 221 The Relief Society sisters also aid in preaching the gospel, They journey around the island holding meetings and preaching and explaining the gospel wherever they get an opportunity. Much good has been done in this way. Many boys and girls have been induced to attend our schools through these journeys and later have made some of our best Church members. It is quite a novelty to the outsiders to see women standing up in the pulpit. They are taught that all a woman is good for is to stay at home and slave for her husband, taking care of the children and waiting on him. When they see our sisters preaching, therefore, they become interested and want to know more about a Church which gives its women such liberty and freedom. Our Relief Society.sisters are also well dressed and most of them talk a little English, especially the younger ones. These things also draw forth admiration and create a desire to investigate. The natives do like to hear their president translate and read for them articles from your splendid little Magazine. They can hardly realize that they have sisters like themselves engaged in the same work in nearly every nation in the world. They are greatly surprised when we tell them of the grand and noble work the "Au-Alosa" (Relief Societies) of other countries are doing and they ask, "Why can't we help, too?" They are a brave little band, true to the callings that are made of them, and often, as is true at home, outshine the men. in faithfulness. We all enjoy readingthe Relief Society Magazine, and appreciate the efforts which are being put forth month by month by its editors to make it successful in fulfiling the ends for which it was established.
