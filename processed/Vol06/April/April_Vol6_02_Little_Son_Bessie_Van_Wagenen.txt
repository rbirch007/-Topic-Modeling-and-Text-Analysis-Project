Little Son Bessie Van Wagenen
======================================================================

LITTLE SON By Bessie Van Wagenen. O! how I miss you, baby boy. Thy tiny body pressed against my breast. The little rosebud mouth. The glossy curls. The chubby little neck I loved to kiss, Thine eyes, deep, dark, like pools, — All these, sweet little love boy, how I miss! They say your mission here on earth is done. Ah! well I know now what thy mission was. It was to turn me from the shallow path of life Into the path that leads to paradise; And make me wake and realize That life is nothing after all Unless I live so as to gain eternal life. They say your mission here on earth is done. Ah, little boy, I could not call you back Into this world of sorrow and of strife; But, little spirit baby, hover clo.se; Help me to say, "My Father's will be done." Help me to live the Father's laws so well That when my work is finished here on earth That I may meet our Father and my son. The Funny Bone
