Construction AND RECONSTRUCTINO IN THE HOME Janette A. Hyde and Lucile Young McAllister. The Lingerie Waist. For wearing with a suit there is nothing to take the place of a dainty waist. There are many beautiful, fine materials in lawns, voiles, silks and crepes, but most beautiful and most popular among these is the georgette crepe. So, far practicality's sake, we will make the georgette crepe waist the subject of this lesson. Just a word, in passing, on the material itself. Many people condemn the use of georgette crepe because it is extremely sheer and transparent, and often garments made from it are immodest. This stand is not well taken, for a well made garment from this material could not be otherwise than beautiful, but the underclothing worn beneath it is at fault. The very qualities of sheerness, transparency and softness are the secrets of its beauty. Let me suggest then that in planning a crepe waist you also plan an underwaist of India, silk, crepe de chene or wash satin, and be sure it sufficiently covers the body. For women wearing the L. D. S. garments, I would suggest long sleeves and high neck so that none of the knitted material is visible. I have found it very practical to use old waists of crepe de chene or wash satin in this connection. White waists, a little yellow from laundering, can be tinted. In the new waists of this spring there are some decidedly new points to be seen. Some of them are: the back fastening, the round neck, the peplins and panels below the waist and the embroidery ofwool in oriental colors. How to proceed with the waist. After choosing the style and color very carefully, lay your pattern on the material preparatory to cutting, but be mindful of the following suggestions, which seem unimportant but which will have everything to do with the success of your waist: Do not try to cut on a table where there are other articles. Clear your table of everything save your material, which must be perfectly straight to begin with. You cannot cut georgette crepe with dull scissors, for every time you attempt to cut with dull ones you will pull the crepe out of place and lose the shape of your waist. The suggestions on the use of the pattern given in the last 226 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. number should be carefully considered. If you.desire a back fastening, place the center front of the pattern on the fold of the material, and the allowance for lapping and fastening should be made in the center of the back. Do not allow any fullness in the center of the front, but leave that space plain if you desire to embroider the front. All crepe waists are better with fullness, but make the allowance from the shoulder, as shown before. Allow wide seams. This is very important with the crepe and all other materials which lack body, for the following reasons:the waist must be made large — it will neither wear or look well if it is too tight; then you must have plenty of material to make a good seam. It is impossible to make a smooth seam and work near the edge of the crepe. The difficulty some people experience in making these waists can be attributed to too small an allowance for seams. You will not find georgette crepe difficult to handle if you work back from the edge. Baste the waist together carefully and use silk of the same shade for basting on the seams which are to be hemstitched. I advise this because after the hemstitching is done it is sometimes impossible to remove the basting, and where silk of the same shade is used it is not necessary to remove it. Baste the shoulder seam by placing the back over the front after first gathering the front, and baste from the top. See Fig. 1. After fitting the waist, French-seam the under-arm seam and the sleeve. The sleeve should only be sewed as far as the elbow, if there is hemstitching to be done on the cuff. The seam can be sewed on down after the hemstitching is done. The parts of the waist which are generally hemstitched are as follows: the shoulder seam, the armeye seam, the joining of the collar to the waist, bottoms of the sleeves and edges of collars. In the case of the last two, the edge is cut away so as to leave a pic.ot edge. See Fig. 2. Seams should be very firmly basted. This will enable the hemstitcher to do better work for you. Where you desire the picot edge, mark the exact place where you wish the edge to be with a basting thread. This will serve as a guide in the hemstitching. See Fig. 3. For the benefit of women who live in small towns and places where there are no hemstitching machines, I would advise you to mail it to the Hemstitching Department of any of the following stores: Z. C. M. I., Singer Sewing Machine Company, or other large department stores. Enclose a paper stating clearly where you wish hemstitching done and also send money enough to cover the cost of the work and return postage. The work is now done at the rate of fifteen cents a yard on silk and ten cents a yard on cotton. You can CONSTRUCTION IN THE HOME. 227 228 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. measure the amount of hemstitching on your waist with a tape measure and calculate the exact cost. Hand Trimming of the Waist. Where you trim your waist will depend entirely on the design of the waist, but one must be careful not to overdo the trimming. Do not spread the work too much over the waist, but center it in one place. A much more artistic effect can be obtained in this way. We find the waists this year trimmed in beads, silk and wool. In the wool especially do we find the designs and colors tending toward the oriental. The colors are bright and the majority of the designs are simple, straight line designs. The two most popular stitches are the satin stitch and French knots placed close enough to give an effect similar to Turkish toweling. The georgette crepe may be easily embroidered in the following manner: Place your design on white paper; if possible do not use a carbon sheet to transfer it to the paper, as it often rubs off on to the material. Have the design drawn in ink. Baste the paper with the design and about six thicknesses of newspaper under the crepe. Small stitches must be used to hold the crepe firm. The design shows plainly through the crepe and can be worked from the top. Fig. 4. — Design for front of Waist, should be worked in wool in oriental colors, such as red, blue and green; or orange, blue and black. The lines show the direction of the stitches. Fig. 5.— A design for band trimming. The figures should be v/orked in outline stitch,* while the dotted background is worked in beads. A waist of tan or grey georgette crepe with these motifs worked out in delf blue and coral would be very effective. The portion of the motif marked "a" could be worked in two shades of blue, and the portion marked "b" in two shades of coral; beads of white or grey might be used for the background. Fig. 6. — This design should be outlined with a line of beads with the dots worked solid in the satin stitch. Note. — If help is needed in making designs write to the Editor of this department.
