Editorial: Our Christmas Testimony
======================================================================

OUR CHRISTMAS TESTIMONY. Have you a testimony of the mission of Jesus Christ? When we come to celebrate the Christmas memorial festival, we mothers are so concerned with the domestic problems thrust upon us that we seldom take time to consider the profound meaning of the time and the occasion. Moreover, women too often only feel religion, and they are content with hoping and believing without achieving any stronger testimony concerning the Savior's life and death. I was in an automobile accident the other day and because of bruises on my face and eye, lost the use of that eye for a period. The first thought that came when the shock occurred was, this is the end and I am facing death. The next thought was, I have a burial insurance, and my family will not be taxed with my funeral expenses. And then as I knew my life was spared came the flashing gratitude that I wear my garments right, and God has delivered me from death. For a time I went about trying to see and study and work with my one eye, and never before could I sympathize with those who are thus permanently handicapped in life. I sometimes fumbled my work, broke dishes and could not focus thought or hand. Considering this I said: "How many people see truth with one eye only, and how few are really insured for heavenly existence." Hope and belief are good, but they are not enough. We need EDITORIAL. 717 the sight of both eyes of the spirit. If I have not insured my testimony concerning this gospel the time must come when it shall be shaken or even destroyed, and when the weakness of my testimony will poison my tongue with bitter criticism and kill the faith of my children through my failure to pay my daily and Sabbath installments on the insurance of my life hereafter. I must know ? not just hope or believe, that Jesus is the Christ. How shall I learn or acquire that knowledge? The Savior lived and worked upon the earth. Let me vision him as a baby; as a boy playing about the streets of Nazareth, serene, kind, courteous, yet so faultless in his virtues that his companions scarcely realized the heights or depths of his self-restraint and exquisite purity. I must picture him with the two eyes of hope and testimony helping his father Joseph in his slow moving, ancient carpenter's labors or listening with gentle tenderness to the instructions of his mother. I can go with him on that journey up to Jerusalem and ascend the temple courts with him, listening while he puzzles the doctors, after his confirmation ceremonies, with the wisdom of all the ages that was his. I follow him in my thoughts as he greets his cousin John on the banks of the Jordan ? John who might have been puzzled as to the divinity of Jesus until he saw the Holy Spirit like a dove descend and rest upon his cousin's head; I listen to John's declaration that he knew then that he was not worthy to fasten the shoe lace of the Man who hereafter was to be his Master and his Lord. Each scene of his life is lovely to contemplate, and oh, how terrible the closing tragedy of that matchless sacrifice. I cannot live in my thoughts with the Master re-creating for myself these earthly scenes of his life, in my Sabbath hours or when I lie upon my pillow, without receiving in my soul the witness, the testimony that he is, he was, and forever will be the Savior of the world. Blessed miracle! With that consciousness growing within me, comes the fruits of the Spirit, love for all of my associates, service to my dear ones, peace in pain, and rejoicing in experience. "He lived and loves me for his own;" not only me, weak mortal that I am, but equally he loves each child born of Adam. And so, let us sit in the Christmas twilight and think of him with our two eyes open to the beauty of his life, the glory of his sacrifice, and we may well feel that we are insuring our association with him on the other side through loving service here, and obedience to his gospel, in all its laws and commandments on this earth. So shall we face life and death happily, and with peace, for He is here and He is there.
