Beyond Arsareth. (Continued.) By Nephi Anderson I see that already I have used up quite a number of pages of my precious paper, and so I must not write so much of my experience that summer on board the ship Esken. I shall have to make that short and get to the important part of my story. I think it was in the month of June when we finished catching seals and moved up nearly to the 80 degrees to look for whales. We caught a number, and it must have been exciting sport. I was altogether too green a hand to take part in this dangerous business, but by this time I was getting some experience in handling a boat, and learning a little of other seaman duties. All this stood me well in hand, as shall presently appear. The sun was now up all the time, and there was a continuous glare of the brightest light on everything around us. Especially did the ice glisten in the sunlight until one's eyes ached to look at it. The eternal light made me long for a bit of darkness, and ofttimes I would draw the blinds of the cabin windows to induce a little natural sleep. The air was quite warm now, and it was a keen pleasure to breathe in the dry, crisp atmosphere, and to live as it seemed like living in a new, strange world. But terrible times soon came to the ship Esken, and its crew. That treacherous Polar Ocean may one day be calm and peaceful and the next be in the embrace of a howling storm. The summer was well advanced, and the ship had already gathered a good harvest, when one day the wind came from the south-west and blew with such power that ice floes, ships and all were driven northward. This was not what we wanted. Already we had been further north than any of the crew had ever before been, and it was time to be working southward. The sea had been quite open to the North and so we had sailed as far as we had wished without hindrance. But, as Captain Larsen said, we were not out on an expedition to find the Pole, so the continuous open water was no temptation to us. Yet northward we drifted. The ice behind us, packed in tight and hard, without lanes or openings. We, therefore, had to be patient until the gale blew over, when, we could no doubt pick our way back again. But day after day passed and there were no openings towards the south. Seals and whales were of minor importance now. The Captain took observations each day, but I do not now remember what the results were. I understood very little about such matters anyway, and only when I saw that the men were getting uneasy, did I know that there was any danger. The storm continued. Sometimes great clouds of snow so 712 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. filled the air that we were unable to see the length of the ship. There seemed to be plenty of open water ahead of us, so there was no immediate danger from the ice. The Esken was built for the business and did not mind a few bumps from ice blocks. I believe the storm lasted for a week, and then there came a pause. At last, the wind did not blow so hard, although the sky was full of clouds. Then the anxiety deepened, for the clear water was gone and not only on the south, but on the north were vast fields of ice. The ship was surrounded by ice floes, and to add to the danger, these fields of ice were moving backward and forward, grinding against each other with deafening noise. "Captain," said I one day ? we were in the cabin after dinner? "where are we?" "We are nearer the North Pole than any man has yet been," said he. "Well, that's something," said I, in the cheeriest way possible, for I saw he was troubled. "It will be, if we get home again," and as he said it he looked up at the portrait on the cabin wall. We were now well along in the month of July, I think. There was yet plenty of time to get back home, if only the ice would let us; but there certainly seemed to be poor prospects. The men were constantly making efforts to travel over the ice sheets with which the ship was surrounded, but they could get no distance owing to the movements of the floes. It began to be disheartening. The ice packed in firmer than ever, and at times there was considerable danger of a crush. Then a thick fog settled over everything. Another week went by; and then the Captain gathered the men into the cabin and spoke to them. He explained that the ice pressure was getting greater each day, and that there was danger of the ship's being crushed. The situation was talked over by all who wished to say anything, and it was decided to prepare to leave the ship at a moment's notice should it be necessary. Boats, provisions, etc., were placed in readiness for removal. A few days later the critical moment came. We were seated at the supper table when we heard a cracking sound in the sides of the ship. The noises increased until they were terrific. Then the vessel began to tremble and shake, and it felt as if she was being lifted up. Then the noises ceased and the ship sank down into her place again. But we did not wait for a second squeeze. Orders were given and soon there was life and stir. A boat was lowered and dragged onto one of the largest and firmest floes. Bags, boxes, instruments, etc., soon followed and were stacked up. Then another pressure came. We could hear it at a distance coming to- BEYOND ARSARETH. 713 wards the ship like the thundering rumble of an earthquake. Nearer and nearer it came. The ice cracked in all directions, and where the pressure was great piled itself up into great heaps. It felt as if the world under one's feet was heaving and trembling, as in fact it was. I was one of the first to abandon the ship. I was told to take what belongings I could carry in my hands and get over to the ice floe. I picked up my small traveling bag, slipped on my fur overcoat and scrambled over the ship's side to the ice, for all the world, now I think of it, like a man just starting out on a few days' journey. One of the sailors, Karlson by name, was ill, and I was told to remain with him by the small boats on the ice. The second pressure did not reach the ship, so there was a breathing spell for a few minutes; but another, fiercer than ever, soon came. It opened long lanes of blue water, over which the men on the ice had often to cross. They were working hard to save what they could from the ship, as they felt sure that she could not stand many more onslaughts from the ice. And now the wind stiffened again and with it came a bank of snow, which filled the air and made it dangerous to move. The scene will never be forgotten. The howling wind, the whirling snow, the thundering of the ice, the shouting of the men ? all the time Karlson and I were on the ice floe ? he was not strong enough to help and I? well, I was useful as a watcher. Then for a time, I hardly knew what happened. The ship was lost to view in the blinding snow storm. The voices of the men grew fainter and then ceased altogether. Had the ship gone down with all on board! That was hardly probable as they could have escaped on the surrounding ice. I made a shelter for Karlson with boxes and canvas, and waited; but no sounds came. The snow veil became thinner, but the ship was not in sight. Walking towards the vessel, I came, within fifty yards of the water, lapping against the clean-cut edge of the ice. I could not see across, and my shouts were not answered. I went back to the sick sailor. "Karlson," said I, "we are adrift." "What!" said he, arousing himself. "I fear we are adrift. I can see or hear nothing of the men nor the ship, and there is water close at hand. What can we do?" "Drag the boat to the water and get back," said he. "That is the only thing to do ? and be quick about it." I tried to move the boat. I could not budge it. Karlson was hardly able to sit up, but he came bravely to my help, but his strength was not in his muscles, and we could do nothing. The snow had made a heavy slush; besides, the boat was too heavy. We now felt that we were on a moving mass. In what direction we 714 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. were moving or at what rate, we could not tell; but we were yet alive, and that was more than we could safely say of our comrades. Our weakness had perhaps been our salvation. For hours we sat and looked at each other, saying very little. The snow ceased and the sun came out, but nothing more did we ever see of the ship Esken or its crew. Now that we could see our position we found that our floe was a good sized one. Up towards its center there was a higher ridge of ice, and on that I decided to prepare our camp. We had plenty of provisions and clothing, and we could live quite comfortable as long as our floating island would bear us in safety. There seemed to be no immediate danger, at least. I brushed away the snow, and with boxes and canvas I managed to make a shelter. We opened a box of provisions, and I melted some ice in our oil stove. Karlson partook sparingly, but I ate a hearty meal. There was ice all around us. It seemed to be drifting with us, sometimes opening and then coming together again with a grinding noise. If only the contending masses would not disturb us! I asked Karlson if he could take an observation of the sun to determine about where we were, but he was no wiser in that respect than I. There were instruments no doubt in our mass of stuff taken from the ship, but they were useless to us. The sun went around and around in its endless path. We had beautiful weather, and had my companion been well, we could have been comfortable enough. But he was in a bad way. For hours he would lie perfectly still, and I would have believed him dead had it not been for the wide-open gaze which he fixed on the southern horizon. Poor fellow, he no doubt had some one looking northward with just as hungry a look as was his, southward. We had medicine, too; I tried some of the simpler remedies which I knew, but Karlson became weaker day after day until at last he died. I think it was on our third day adrift that I was left alone. I carried the body of my dead comrade a few rods away from the camp, and covering it with canvas, left it there. The next day it occurred to me that it would be better to give him a seaman's burial than to have the body lie in the warm sun. So I went to work and wrapped it in a sheet of canvas, placing a heavy iron kettle at the feet. I then carried it to the edge of the floe, to a large opening. From my traveling bag I took the Bible which I had carried with me, but, shame to say, I had not read much, and from it I read aloud a chapter. I fear the selection was not very appropriate, but it was something anyway. Then I slipped the BEYOND ARSARETH. 715 body over the edge of the ice and it sank into the cold, green water of the sea. Now, indeed, was I alone. I was a living speck in the vast frozen, northern world. Yet, somehow, I was not lonesome. I had read the descriptions given of this region by Arctic explorers and had thought that in this sublime solitude I might draw some peace of heart. In this vast expanse of snow and ice and water, with the continuous brightness of the sun, my soul was subdued. The strangeness of my situation appealed to me. The uncertainty of my fate did not seem to disturb me. I can see now that I ought to have given up even the faintest shadow of hope as regards living any length of time ? but strange to say I did not. I had retained my watch with me, and had thus far been able to keep track of the time and also the directions. At twelve midnight, the sun was a little nearer the horizon than when it was twelve noon. By this I knew I was drifting north. My ice floe kept intact, though I could see all around me wide lanes of green water leading sometimes to the horizon. Slowly, day by day, I drifted in a northerly direction. At first, we had seen some animal life, a bear, some walruses, and quite a number of screaming birds; but now there was not a sign of life. This could not have been because of the cold, as it seemed to me to become warmer the further north I drifted. I suffered no great inconvenience. I made myself comfortable in the shelter I had built. I had plenty to eat and drink, and then I had this vast, strange world to myself. The ice floes around me diminished, and in a few days I was floating in a free sea, unhindered by ice or land as far as I could see to the north. Yes I had indeed come into a new world, but I had brought my old heart with me, and its life in that other world which I had left would not be obliterated. I have heard that the heart is the last part of a person that dies, and this, perhaps is the reason. Sitting day after day on the highest point of my ice-island and looking at the sky and waves, my mind's eye went out past the great ice barrier which, seemingly, I had left behind me, to a world of high mountains, rushing streams and green fields and meadows! And thus I saw a simple farm house ? no, not mine ? not the one I lived in, but another some miles farther up the road. I saw the dingy, red brick, the neglected lawn, the rows of box-elder trees; and then I saw one in her light summer dress come to meet me with a hand extended and a smile of welcome. I heard her words. I saw the light in her eyes ? the light that was so easily extinguished. Yes, I saw and heard and felt, ah, yes, I felt that my heart was yet the greatest thing that I had brought with me from that other world, and it would assert itself, no matter where I was or what I was doing!
