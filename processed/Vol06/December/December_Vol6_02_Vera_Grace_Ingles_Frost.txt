Vera Grace Ingles Frost
======================================================================

VERA. Grace Ingles Frost. Fair as a fragile lily in her last sleep she lay, A flower chaste and regal that, at the close of day, Wears its stainless petals, despite of winds and rain Whose fancy beat upon it, inflicting bruise and pain; And, as the stately blossom is touched by a healing ray Of sun, where the gloom is rifted at birth of a new day, So has the hand of Jesus touched Vera, in its love, And she is healed and haloed and passed all storms above.
