Thrift Hints

THRIFT HINTS. To keep white crepe de chine waists from turning yellow: After washing, wrap the waist in a Turkish towel overnight and in the morning it will be damp enough to iron. If done in this way white crepe de chine waists will keep the dead white of new material. Hanging in the air is what makes them yellow. To restore flesh-colored crepe de chine waists and underwear: Put a piece of red crepe paper in the rinse water. Test the color with a piece of cheesecloth and when of the right shade immerse the waist in the colored water. To clean kid gloves: Put on hands, dip in soap solution, and then wash with gasoline. After washing, pass the gloves through a wringer between two clean cloths, pull them in shape, and hang in the air to dry. After drying, dust white gloves with powdered pipe clay, chalk, or magnesia. Once a month, in the evening, pour a cupful of kerosene down the sink drain, and next morning follow it with a pailful of boiling water. The kerosene dissolves the grease from the sides of the drain pipe and the boiling water carries it away. Tablecloths and napkins will last longer if when ironed they are folded in three parts one week and four the next ironing. Try putting a teaspoonful of salt in the starch on wash day. The clothes will not be so apt to stick to the line, neither will they lose their stiffness. Pin small articles on a towel before taking out doors. It will take but a moment to fasten the towel to the line and will save space and clothespins. Narrow strips of rubber cut from worn out hot-water bags or rubbers make fine weather strips for drafty doors or windows. Why not shade your back porch with a screen of lima beans? The crop may surprise you. THE
