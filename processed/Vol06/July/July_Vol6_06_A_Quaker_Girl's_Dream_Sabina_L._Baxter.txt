A Quaker Girl's Dream Sabina L. Baxter
======================================================================

Quaker Girls Dream, Sabina L. Baxter. I dreamed I was on my way to school, when suddenly I noticed a great crowd upon a green park-like place. People were hurrying to and fro, and when I asked what all this commotion was about, a girl said: "Why, do you not know? It's measuring day, and the Lord s Angel has come to see how much our souls have grown since last measuring day." "Measuring day," said I, "measuring souls? I never heard of such a thing." I began to ask questions, but the girl hurried on. After a little while I let myself be pressed along with the crowd to the green park. There in the center, on a kind of throne under the green elm was the most glorious and beautiful being I ever saw. His clothes were of shining white, and he had the kindest yet most serious face I ever beheld. By his side was a tall golden rod, fastened upright in the ground, with curious marks, at regular intervals, from top to bottom. Over it, in golden scroll, were the words, "The measure of a perfect man." The Angel held in his hand a large book in which he wrote the measurements, as the people came up at the calling of their names in their turns. The instant each one touched the golden measure, a most wonderful thing happened: no one could escape the terrible accuracy of that strange spiritual rod. Each one shrank or increased tohis true dimensions— his dimensions, as I soon learned— for it was an index of the soul-gr owth which was shown in this mysterious way. The first few who were measured after I came 1 did not know, but soon the name of Elizabeth Darrow was called; she is president of our Society, and she is in ever so many other societies and I thought, surely by E. Darrow's measure will be very clubs, too, and But as she stood rod, the insmnt she touched hicrh indeed s face itlhe seemed to grow shorter and shorter, and the Angel grew very serious as he said: "This would be a soul of high stature if only the zeal for outside works, which can be seen trust of man and had not checked the lowly, secret graces of humility and patience undertlittlesou daily trials. These, too, are needed for perfect growth." I pitied Elizabeth Darrow as she moved away with such poor, sad and surprised face, to make room for the next. It was more astonthin little Betsy Lines, the seamstress.

And as the Angel wrote in the book, he said: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." The next was Lillian Edgar, who dresses so beautifully that I have often wished I had such clothes and so much money. The Angel looked sadly at her measure, for it was very low — so low that Lillian turned pale as death — and her beautiful clothes no one noticed at all, for they were quite overshadowed by the glittering robes of the bright Angel beside her. And the Angel said in a solemn tone: "Oh, child, why take thought of raiment? Let your adorning be not that of outward appearance nor the putting on of apparel, but let it be the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is, in the sight of God, of great price. Thus only canst thou grow like the Master." Old Jerry, the janitor, came next — poor, old, clumsy Jerry. But as he hobbled up the steps the Angel's face fairly blazed with light, and he smiled on him and led him to the rod; and behold, Jerry's measure was higher than that of any of the others. The Angel's voice rang out so loud and clear that we all heard him saying: "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted," And then, oh, my name came next! And I trembled so that I could hardly reach the Angel, but he put his arm around me and helped me to stand by the rod. As soon as I touched it, I felt myself growing shorter and shorter, and though I stretched and strained every nerve to be as tall as possible, I could only reach Lillian's mark — Lillian's, the lowest of all — and I had been a member of the Church for two years! I grew crimson for shame, and whispered to the Angel: "Oh, give me another chance before you mark me in the book as low as this. Tell me how to grow. I will do it all so gladly, only do not put this mark down." The Angel shook his head sadly. "The record must go down as it is, my child. May it be higher when I come next time. This rule will help thee. Whatsoever thou doest, do it heartily as to the Lord, in singleness of heart as unto Christ." And with that I burst into tears, and suddenly awakened, to find myself crying. But, oh, I shall never forget that dream. I shall never forget my humiliating mark! A
