Medical Needs in the Days of Moses and Today Mary Foster Gibbs
======================================================================

Medical Needs in the Days of Moses and Today. Mary Foster Gibbs. The Latter-day Saints are peculiarly open-minded in their attitude towards life. The cardinal principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ is faith in God and his ever-renewing revelations. Truth never changes, but because times and circumstances bring new angles upon any truth or principle, the gospel comprehends the living adjustment of truth's atmosphere to suit men's minds and conditions. Because of this flexible quality in our spiritual attitude we are given to extremes at times. If we speak in terms of politics, we are inclined to be partisan in the extreme. If we consider education, not even the newest and latest fad is sufficiently advanced for our quick apperceptions; while in all other avenues of social and spiritual life, we are ever on the watch-tower, listening for the swift approach of events and up-do-date appeals which shall alter and amend our fortress to admit the restless troops of ideas and ideals that constitute our outer mental assailants. We are extremely hopeful, and were, in olden days, devout and childlike in faith and trust. Philosophers tell us that such an attitude of mind sometimes renders its possessor a fearful man and a credulous one. Happily our faith is founded on the Rock of Ages, so that in common with most of our American citizenry, we possess admirable poise and our final judgment restores the perfect equilibrium. Just now our western communities, and indeed the world at large, seem beset with the clamor of medical appraisement, and the glamor of medical achievement. Let us consider wisely and calmly the case of wives and mothers in this Church and kingdom on this subject of medical need and medical aid. First, then, we are confronted with the high cost of medical 376 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. assistance, which has affrighted the young married people of this community more than their elders care to admit. So rapid has been the increase in charges, so insistent and socially benumbing are the financial requirements made by doctors and nurses, that parenthood has become well nigh prohibitive, unless young people are well-to-do, or have wealthy relatives. Operations are the order of the day: teeth, tonsils, appendixes — although these later operations are getting a little out of fashion — feet with fallen arches, and corns, and all sorts of internal embellishments for women, strew the triumphant pathway of the successful surgeon. Concealed poison, pus, microbes and neuritis have become familiar terms in the daily vocabulary of even the proletariat. A young couple who are trying to live on $75 or even $100 a month gaze into the future appalled at the cost of a hospital room for the prospective mother costing $35 a week, with nurses at $25 and $35 a week, very possible operations — especially if physicians are in a hurry — with medical trimmings extra. What are young people to do? Fortunate the young wife who lives in the country and has a mother who is able and willing to nurse her in the old-fashioned way. The good old-fashioned midwife has been driven out of our communities, and statistics fail to testify of very much improvement in conditions because of their loss. The old world has been staggering along with babies coming into the world by the aid of midwives for over 5,500 years, yet now-a-days a woman is practically barred from the chamber of birth, through public opinion, and shrewd, indirect manipulation of press and social exchange. It may well be that some day the careful and God-fearing midwife may find her way back into her own beautiful kingdom. No one, least of all myself, dares to say very much about this condition, lest we shall be called unprogressive, narrow-minded, bigoted, and lacking in intelligence and culture; for we are all, as was said in the beginning of this article, very open-minded to the call of progressivism and very sensitive about refusing truth in whatever guise it may appear. Just what is truth in these matters of medicine is rather difficult for even an intelligent reader and student to determine. We are told by very distinguished physicians that surgery has practically become a science, but that the practice of medicine, with its sometimes pompous silences and frequent experimentations, is as little understood and as uncertain as it was in the days of Hippocrates and Galen. Said a distinguished patient who died not long since: "I am weary of having my body made an experiment station of by doctors who try one thing for a day or two and change it for something else, and then something else, all the time wishing to see its results, knowing no more than I do, and suffering not at NEEDS IN THE DAYS OF MOSES AND TODAY. 377 all, while I bear all the pangs and horror of their instruments of torture." It would seem that each individual invalid case becomes, as it were, a law unto itself, for no one is just like anyone else in face or form. So, too, it may be assumed that our internal machinery differs in like manner, and no matter how trifling the differences may be, together they constitute internal idiosyncrasies which Copyright, Underwood & Underwood, New York THE TRADITIONAL MOUNT SINAI TOWERING ABOVE THE PLAIN OF THE ASSEMBLY. make the art of medicine a daily surprise and a constant experiment. General rules fit general cases as general coats fit general sized men, but no two are just alike and the off-size people, like the unbalanced internal organisms, require individual study for years in order to even approximate an understanding on the part of the patient or physician. The science of surgery, the art of medicine, and the laws of 378 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. hygiene, while all closely allied, are separate and distinct subjects. What is known as hygiene or the laws of life, comprised usually in the one word, cleanliness, is and always has been a necessity and has been so acknowledged by ancient and modern prophets. The Lord was very careful to instruct Moses concerning the primary principles of hygiene. That great law giver knowing that his vast multitude of 3,000,000 people would not practice these rules unless they formed part of a religious ritual, incorporated them in his divine regulations and laws. He discovered an herb at the waters of Marah which turned the bitterness of the stream into a life-giving fluid (Exodus 15:23-27). He taught them the use of olive oil and spices, showing them how to compound the sacred ointment, which was both incense and disinfectant (Ex. 30: 23-38). He instructed them in the most precise manner concerning the offering of sacrifice, enjoining upon them the cremation of offal from their continuous and vast sacrificial rites (Lev. 1:13-16). He forbade the eating of fat or blood, while contamination with decaying substances and possible germ cultures were likewise strictly forbidden (Lev. 5:2; 3:6; 7:25-27; Ex. 17:10). Cleanliness was enjoined in every branch of temple service, especially in eating and sacrificial offerings (Lev. 8:6; Ex. 29; Ex. 10:14). Animals which were unhealthful for humans to eat were most zealously forbidden, and men today would be healthier and happier if they observed these strict laws (Ex. 11). Women in childbirth were particularly protected through religious enactment, and even in the distant isles of the sea where descendants of Abraham dwelt, and among the Indian women, at this period of time as well as during their monthly need of rest, women in confinement and at monthly periods were isolated in specially constructed houses or huts where no male was permitted to enter (Ex. 12). The Sandwich Islanders, as well as our Indians, kept up these customs until very recently. Leprosy, which was a sexual disorder, brought over to Palestine from Egypt and taken to the Sandwich Islands from the Chinese, was carefully treated in a list of special laws (Ex. 13, 14 and 15). No priest could officiate in the tabernacle ordinances if he had any bodily blemish, so exacting was the Lord concerning possible infection and contagion (Ex. 22). In all oriental countries physicians were members of the priesthood, and as people fell away from the truth, the spiritual exactions of the priests along with their superstition, made a yoke grievous to be borne by the people. We wonder if political conditions of today are going to fasten upon the necks of our moderns similar heavy medical burdens too grievous to be borne. The Lord has not left his people in latter days without light NEEDS IN THE DAYS OF MOSES AND TODAY. 379 Copyright, Underwood & Underwood, New York MONASTERY IN SHADOW OF MOUNT SINAI, WHERE OLD BIBLE MANUSCRIPTS ARE TREASURED. upon this question. He gives a few succinct and careful instructions in the Doctrine and Covenants in what is known as the Word of Wisdom. Even more direct and comprehensive are the hygienic and psychological laws embraced in the following verses from Section 42: 40-52: "And again, thou shalt not be proud in thy heart; let all thy garments be plain, and their beauty the beauty of the work of thine own hands: And let all things be done in cleanliness before me. Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer. And whosoever among you are sick, and have not faith to be healed, but believe, shall be nourished with all tenderness, with herbs and mild food, and that not by the hand of an enemy. And the elders of the Church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay 380 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me. Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die, and more especially for those that have not hope of a glorious resurrection. And it shall come to pass that those that die in me, shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them; And they that die not in me, wo unto them, for their death is bitter. And again, it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed; he who hath faith to see shall see; he who hath faith to hear shall hear; the lame who hath faith to leap shall leap; and they who have not faith to do these things, but believe in me, have power to become my sons; and inasmuch as they break not my laws, thou shalt bear their infirmities." "A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the Council of High Priests, assembled in Kirtland, and Church; and also the Saints in Zion. "To be sent greeting — not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days. "Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints. "Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, in consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation, "That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. "And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make. "And again, strong drinks are not for the body, but for the washing of your bodies. "And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill. "And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. "And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man. "Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. "Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly; "And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine. "All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth; "And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and excess of hunger. "All grain is good for the food of man, as also the fruit of the vine, that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground. "Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all Copyright by Underwood & Underwood, N. Y.

"And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel, and marrow to their bones, "And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; "And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint "And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen." Who among the people today have abiding faith in these life-giving words, or who among us are following thoughtlessly after the teachings of men and the precepts of so-called scientists and expert practitioners? We have faithful Latter-day Saint physicians amongst us, men who are devoted to the service of God and man. Cannot some one among them suggest a remedy for this condition, a solution of this very grievous problem? Would it be a good plan for our young couples to begin married life with paying a monthly maternal or medical insurance which would cover the expenses of childbirth and ordinary sickness? Or what plan could be evolved? Come, physicians, brothers, friends, let us reason together! RICHES. I sit and sew by the window, And out in the garden I see A little plaid bonnet, bobbing about, In the shade of the old apple tree. I hear little feet softly patter, A sweet, rosy face I behold; I am richer by far than most millionaires are, For my treasure is better than gold. Mrs. Parley Nelson. Rexburg, Idaho.
