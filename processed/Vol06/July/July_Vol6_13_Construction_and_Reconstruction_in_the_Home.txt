CONTINUATION OF MAKING OF TAILORED SKIRT.
Basting.
The type of seam used will make some difference in how we should proceed to baste the skirt. In all cases, however, two points must be carefully kept in mind (a) Baste from the top of the skirt down so that all unevenness will come out at the bottom of the skirt, (b) as you baste be careful not to stretch the material in either side of the seam. The latter results in an ugly drawn seam and no amount of pressing will remedy this fault.
The two most used types of seams at the present time are the plain tailored seam (in this the two edges of the seam are turned the same way on the wrong side and the stitching is done on the right side) and the ordinary seam with the edges separated and pressed apart on the wrong side (see figures a and b).
In basting for the plain seam proceed as already suggested on the wrong side, from the top of the skirt to the bottom, being very careful to take up as much material as you have allowed for seam. In the previous number one inch seams were suggested. This you will find makes it very much easier to keep from stretching either side of the seam as you are working far enough back from the raw edge, for the material to retain its firmness.
3. In the tailored seam, first baste back one inch of material on the edges of the front gore. When basted press with a damp cloth over so as to give a decided fold on the edge. Then place this folded edge one inch over the edge of the side gore and baste together from the right side. This can best be done flat on the table and lessens the danger of stretching the material. When you finish basting each seam hold it up against you and look down at it to see if the material is properly adjusted. Fitting the Skirt. Before fitting the skirt hem the ends of the belting and sew the hooks and eyes on it, so that it just comes together. With 423 CONSTRUCTION IN THE HOME. the present styles a two inch or inch and a half belting should be used. Pin the.skirt to the upper edge of the belting so that the hooks and eyes come even with the placket of the skirt. Then make what changes are necessary and, as in fitting a waist, do not try to make changes without unbasting the seam to be corrected. If the fullness falls too much to the front of the skirt it is generally the result of the front being hollowed out too much and to correct this raise the back up until the folds in the skirt fall in the proper place. On the other hand, the reverse of this efifect will result from the front not being cut low enough to be in accordance with the back. The placket comes on the left side and is usually about eleven inches long. It is not necessary to trim the bottom at the first fitting, in fact it is much safer for a beginner in dressmaking to entirely finish the top of the skirt before trimming the bottom. About 424 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. five inches from the floor is the proper length at the present time for a tailored skirt. The Scam. When the fitting' is completed sew up the seams with sewing silk. One of the most vital points in skirt making is the proper adjustment of the tentions of the sewing machine. If you do not know how to loosen or tighten the upper and lower tentions have an agent explain it to you at once. Both threads must pull evenly and for skirts seams must be loose or the seam will be drawn inspite of all the pressing one might do. See figure C and  D. Next thoroughly press the seams with a damp cloth and hot iron. The method of finishing the wrong side of the seams can be determined only by the weight of the material. The best methods are as follows: (a) Clipping in points — this is very suitable for extra heavy materials that do not frey. (b) Binding— great care must be taken in this to avoid making the binding" too bulky and cord like. (c) Turning the edge back and stitching. (d) Stitching on the edge by machine and then overcasting. In all these metho 's the seams must be carefully trimmed to an even width. The Placket. The placket is probably the most difficult of all parts of the skirt and there are several good ways of finishing the placket. The main point, however, is to make it neat and invisible. Figure E and F will give you some idea of one method I have used a great deal and found very practical. The Bottom of the Skirt. A hem is always preferable — usually in tailored skirts about tliree inches deep. If the material is heavy, bind the upper edge instead of making a second turn. Figure G will give you some idea of placing the little plaits in the hem where the bottom of the skirt is curved. In case you face a skirt — use the same material if possible and if a substitute is necessary have it as nearly as possible of the same quality. The facing should always be cut in the true bias of the material. This is preferable to a facing cut to fit the curve. CONSTRUCTION IN THE HOME. 425 The hem of facing should always be sewed by hand and made as nearly invisible as possible. I know of no material used for tailored skirts which does not look much better hemmed by hand. The Belt. The belts to tailored skirts are usually made separate when they go all the way around the waist. A small belt across the fullress in the back may be lined with a silk to match the material and then tacked in place, or if so desired, may be left separate and adjusted when the skirit is worn.
