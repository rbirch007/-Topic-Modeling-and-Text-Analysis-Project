======================================================================

Friendly Rhyme in Honor of E. Wesley Smith and Family. Lillie T. Freeze. You are saying farewell to the ocean, The seagull and sands of the shore, To the fisherman's boats and the sea shells, To the spray and the ocean's roar; To the storms and their wild commotion, To the rainbow's hues on the foam, Creating a memory picture To carry where'er you may roam. To the song birds and lovely flowers, To the hum of the wild honey-bee, To the trailing vines and the palm trees, As far as the eye can see: To the purple and gold o'er the islands, To the glorious tints o'er the hills, To the calm and balm of the climate, That the soul of all nature thrills. To the peace and rest of "Deseret", With its orange and green lemon trees, Where sweet odors are wafted over On the wings of the mountain breeze. But you are going back to your mountain home, To its canyons, its rocks and its rills, To the home of your happy childhood, This thought with gratitude thrills; To the arms of a loving mother, To brothers and sisters kind, These ties to the heart of a rover, Forever to homeland will bind — And you're taking — let's count o'er the treasures — There must be a wonderful store, To fill all your thoughts in the future, 404 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. There's the love of the Saints in the branches, Great respect from mountain to shore, For kindness and thoughtful attention Made manifest o'er and o'er. In seasons of sickness and trial You've extended a helping hand, And been as a friend and a brother In the hearts of this ocean band. With smiling suggestion and counsel Have you helped o'er some difficult place, Inspiring with faith, hope and courage, And charity's saving grace. And the beautiful truths of the gospel, You have sown with a willing hand, Some time there will be a rich harvest From seed sown in this fair land. In the hearts of the little children You've implanted a love for the truth That will guide and direct their footsteps O'er the perilous pathways of youth. To the aged and poor you have given relief, While seeking for rest and health — To all have you ministered graciously, Though in poverty or in wealth. So we have every reason to miss you, And regret that a parting must come At the close of a useful mission, With its duties so faithfully done. And we say, God bless you, our brother, Your children and charming wife, And grant you, in all the future, A happy, successful life. A tribute from the Relief Society of Santa Monica, February, 1919.
