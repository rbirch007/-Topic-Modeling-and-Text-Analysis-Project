November Garden. BULB PLANTING TIME Morag "And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be. * * * But God giveth it a body as it pleaseth Him, and to every seed its own body. * * * So also is the resurrection of the dead." I Cor. 15 chapter 37, 38, 42. The bright, sunny days of our "Indian Summer" provide an ideal time to prepare our garden beds and borders of the Dutch Bulbs, Hyacinths, Tulips, Narcissi, Crocus, etc. They give, for a small outlay of time and money, an abundance of flowers in the house from Thanksgiving until Easter, and in the garden from the time the snow is off the ground until the middle of May. The bulbs are received by our local florists in October, and may be planted outdoors almost up to Christmas. The bed should be well dug at least to the depth of one foot, and thoroughly raked, and mixed with well-rotted manure. For planting, use a pointed stick or dibber. Lily bulbs should be planted six inches deep, and a foot apart; narcissus and hyacinths five inches deep, and six inches apart; Tulips, four inches deep, and four to six inches apart, while the smaller bulbs, as snowdrops, crocus, scilla may be closer together and about three inches deep. First in importance come the tulips in several divisions. Earliest of all are the single tulips. The early double tulips come next, to be followed in May by the so-called cottage tulips, and the Darwins at the end of the season. The Darwin Tulips are splendid beyond description, tall and stately, flowers of great size and substance, lasting full twice as long as other tulips, their exquisite colors ranging from pure white to almost black, including the loveliest shades of pink, crimson, lilac, violet, and others. Next in value come the various narcissi, daffodils, jonquils. They are lovely scattered in groups along the edge of a lawn or close to a building, and these may be left undisturbed for several years. Hyacinths are usually grown in beds, as they have a stiff formal appearance. Those bulbs should be planted five inches deep, on a layer of sand. Hyacinths often disappoint by running out in a few years, and it is well to store them in the cellar during the summer. Crocus and snowdrops may be planted 652 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. in the lawn and will be through flowering before it is time for cutting the grass. All of these bulbs are splendid for cemetery planting and will take care of themselves, making the graves of our dear ones, a place of beauty during the early spring. Flowers in the house all winter. It is possible to have an abundant supply of flowers in the house from Thanksgiving until Easter, at a very small cost. Roman and Dutch hyacinths, paper white narcissus, Chinese sacred lily, and several varieties of polyanthus narcissus, can be grown in the house, and are the most satisfactory bulbs that can be grown for winter flowers. The most delightful way is to plant a quantity in a fern dish or jardiniere, suitable for using as a centerpiece for the dining table. The soil should be light and rich, one third good soil, one third sand, and one third well-rotted manure, the bulbs planted thickly, but should not touch. Water thoroughly, and set in the darkest corner of a cool cellar, for several weeks, water about every two weeks. If brought to the light by first of December you may be sure of flowers for the holidays. Paper white narcissi can be grown in water the same as the Chinese Lily which they surpass in every respect. The dutch Hyacinths should be kept in the cellar until February 1st. Single early tulips and daffodils may be brought to the light March 1, and a splendid display can be had for Easter. One word of caution. Do not water too often, while bulbs are in cellar, or they may become mouldy and rot. To insure a succession of winter flowers, then, first plant, Roman hyacinths, next paper white narcissus, Chinese lilies, Dutch hyacinths, early tulips, polyanthus, narcissus, daffodils. The following narcissus are the best for house culture, Bicolor Empress, Emperor, Von Sion, Poeticus, Incomparabilis, Alba Stella, Golden Spur, Ornatus, Gloriosa, Grand Monarch and Grand Soliel d'or. Most or all of these bulbs can be obtained from any of our local florists, as Porter Walton, Vogler, Miller Floral Co., Bailey. Send for their catalogues; and sisters if you have to make a small sacrifice in order to get them do plant some bulbs. November Garden Notes When the tops of gladioli turn yellow and brown, and the dahlias have been nipped by frost, they should be dug up, dried in the sun for a few days, covering well at night to keep the bulbs from freezing, then remove tops about six inches from gladioli and eight or ten inches on dahlias, as the shoots or eyes THE NOVEMBER GARDEN. 653 for next year's growth are found at the base of the old stalk. Store in a cool, frost-proof cellar. Gladioli may be placed in your goldenglow and other perennials, and space up your beds; your goldenglow and other perennials, and space up your beds wherever possible cover up any seedlings with well-rotted stable litter, tops of plants, etc. When the chrysanthemums have gotten through flowering, or have been frozen, they, too, should be cut down; all remaining annuals should be uprooted and removed and the garden left to receive its winter blanket of protecting snow. Attention should now be given to indoor gardening house plants, and the bulbs. UNITED STATES SCHOOL GARDEN ARMY. A very useful and valuable movement has been undertaken by the government through the Department of the Interior and Bureau of Education; viz.: to establish school supervised gardens. In the east a large response to the appeal of the Bureau was made and we are told that two million children are now enrolled in the School Garden movement. The National Council of Women have endorsed the movement. Certainly the descendants of the Utah Pioneers ought to feel a vital interest in the working out of this school plan. Brigham Young held always that any education which did not provide practical training for the hand as well as theory for the head was of little value. His inspired efforts to persuade his people to build homes and plant fields has resulted in making Utah a state of homes, fields and gardens. It was through his instruction and example that our streets are wide, bordered with trees while our homes are embowered in gardens and flowers. Utah therefore should respond liberally to this government movement. Children who are occupied happily in gardens are not upon the streets and they acquire character while they are becoming acquainted with nature. We recommend to our mothers an interest in this movement. The slogan is: "A garden for every child, every child in a garden." Letters addressed to the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education United States School Garden Army, Washington, D. C., will bring to any individual stories and pamphlets concerning the movement. THE
