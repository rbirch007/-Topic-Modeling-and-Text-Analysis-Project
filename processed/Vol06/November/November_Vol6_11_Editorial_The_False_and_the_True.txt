Editorial: The False and the True
======================================================================

FALSE AND THE TRUE. Many people are mystified by the close likeness of the false and the true things in this life. Brigham Young used to say that "the devil would give you nine truths to get you to believe one error," and he would add, "I will give any man nine errors for one truth." The world is full of garbled truths in social, civil, and religious life. The principles revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith concerning the United Order, the Word of Wisdom, and many other phases of our temporal salvation have been picked up by the world, mixed in with their own errors, and are now placed before the world as great socialistic and prohibition ideas. Brigham Young sought to introduce the United Order, according to the plan laid down by the Prophet Joseph Smith, but the people were not ready for it then, any more than they had been in the Prophet's own day; and it may be that we are not quite ready for it yet. Meanwhile, we are watching the world in its frantic efforts to introduce the pure principles of the United Order, and graft them on to their varying societies and unions. The United Order, in the hands of irreligious and unscrupulous men, will work quite as much injury to the human race as has the debased, corrupted form of the relation of sexes which covers Christendom with a rising tide of disease and death. One might ask how, then, can the United Order be established? First, we would answer: it will not be established rightfully until the man who holds the keys of revelation from God to the people 670 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. of this earth announces the time and the condition. It is certain that men who are steeped in selfishness and greed will never be able to enter that Order, whether they are in the Church or out of the Church. The only principle upon which the United Order can be established is the principle of love, harmony and unselfish devotion one to the other. This people will no doubt share in the judgments of the Lord which are already being poured out upon the nations of the earth; but if they have the spirit of discernment, and the true seed of the gospel within them, it will sprout under the influence of sorrow and suffering until they have learned the bitter lesson of unselfish devotion to one another and to the kingdom of God. On the other hand, those who have not the love of God in their hearts will be hardened and embittered by suffering and trial; the judgments of the Lord will increase their rebellious attitude towards life and towards one another so that whatever fine theories they may adopt, lacking the Spirit of the Lord, their house of cards will fall to the ground with the first evidence of selfish greed on the part of their leaders. Meanwhile, what of the socialists, and what should be the attitude of Latter-day Saints concerning these iconoclasts? We should leave them quietly alone, allowing them the same liberty of conscience and belief which we ourselves enjoy; but we will no more follow after their leaders, blind and mistaken as they are, than we will after the spiritualists like Conan Doyle and Sir Oliver Lodge who have the shadow of revelation while we have the rich substance, the pure revelations from God. These are the perilous days, my sisters, see that you stand in holy places and be not moved. Tomb, thou shalt not hold him longer, Death is strong, but life is stronger; Stronger than the dark, the light, Stronger than the wrong, the right. ROOSEVELT MEMORIAL. A general movement is on foot to build a memorial to our Great American Colonel Theodore Roosevelt. A society has been organized with branches in each state and those in this state who are his devoted admirers, and there be hosts of them, will be glad to respond to the appeal made for funds to assist in this worthy tribute. We heartily commend the movement.
