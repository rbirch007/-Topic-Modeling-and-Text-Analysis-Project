Be Ye of Good Cheer Elsie E. Barrett
======================================================================

Good Cheer. Elsie E. Barrett. War, famine, pestilence! God seems to be scourging the earth! Good, bad and indifferent, none exempt. We can see preparation for a New World's birth. Visions, dreams, prophecies, from seers of ages gone, Are fast coming true, causing sorrow; Soon we'll see the glow of Millennial dawn. Courage, faith, calmness for the world's aching heart,  Out of the chaos, peace, rest We shall see, if we fearlessly do our part. S. L. RICHARDS DAVID O. MCKAY GEO. D. PYPER The
