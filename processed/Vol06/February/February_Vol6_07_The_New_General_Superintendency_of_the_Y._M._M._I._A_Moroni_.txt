The New General Superintendency of the Y. M. M. I. A Moroni Snow
======================================================================

New General Superintendency of the Y. M.M.I. A. Moroni Snow, General Secretary. Complying with your request for an expression of my feelings in relation to the recent change in the General Superintendency of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association of the Church, I wish to say that I have had much joy and satisfaction in my associations for many years past with the former superintendency and, of course, felt the loss in common with all Israel when our beloved head, President Joseph F. Smith, was taken from us by death. I have greatly appreciated the cordial relations that have existed in my associations with President Heber J. Grant, but knowing his often-expressed feelings that the head of the Church should be relieved of the immediate charge as head of the auxiliary associations, I was not surprised when the change in the General Superintendency of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations was made. While regretting the loss of the immediate and active service of President Grant in connection with our General Board, I recognize the wisdom of the move, and I am glad that this detail will now devolve upon others. In the selection of Elder Anthony W. Ivins as the new head of our organization, I was especially well pleased, knowing, as I do, his eminent fitness for the position, through my life-long associations with him. As a boy I had great respect for him, he being my senior by a few years, but later this difference in ages seemed to be bridged, and we grew more and more into each other's lives, having many kindred tastes and 80 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. aspirations. We were closely associated, in Church, political and social life. In the Church, we were connected with the late James G. Bleak in charge of one of the earliest theological classes in St. George, and both passed through the school of experience as officers of the Young Men's Mutuals. I had the pleasure of serving as one of his assistants in the superintendency of the St. George stake, and later succeeded him as stake superintendent, when he was called as a counselor to President D. D. McArthur in the stake presidency. We were associated in various city and county official positions, and in our dramatic and social entertainments we were also united. In all these associations and activities I learned to love him as a friend and brother, and can testify to the sterling qualities that have made him what he is, a man among men. He is preeminently, a boy's man, and his heart and sympathies ever go out to them. In sunshine or sorrow, success or apparent failure, under all circumstances, boys felt they had a friend in Anthony W. Ivins, and none could fall so low that he could not feel for him and extend a helping hand. He enjoyed the confidence and esteem of all the young men with whom he came in contact. He was also the friend and counselor of the Indians throughout southern Utah, who all looked up to him with respect and confidence, as he always dealt with them with scrupulous honesty and fairness. He is a natural born teacher and as such will, I am confident, measure up to every requirement that may be made of him as the head of our organization. May God bless him in these labors. Elder Brigham H. Roberts is too well known as a man of the people to need any commendation from me. He has well earned the title of "defender of the faith," which has been accorded to him by those who best know him. My personal associations with Elder Roberts have been somewhat limited, but I have learned to respect him as a staunch champion of freedom and the rights of the common people. In his present position as chaplain of the 145th Regiment (Utah) Field Artillery, he has won the love and esteem of every soldier of the regiment, and those qualities which naturally appeal to the boy will have abundant opportunity to manifest themselves in the future as they have in the past as First Assistant General Superintendent. As to Elder Richard R. Lyman, the Second Assistant to Elder Ivins, my personal relations with him have also been limited, but I have known his eminent father, the late President Francis M. Lyman, since boyhood, and loved and honored him as a man of God and a close friend of my own father. If the son inherits the noble qualities of the father, as I feel assured he does, he will prove worthy in every respect in his high and holy calling. He is one of the younger generation, but has graduated in Mutual work NEW SUPERINTENDENCY OF Y. M. M. I. A. 81 and will be of the greatest help to our great Mutual cause, and I feel we are to be congratulated on his selection as one of our leaders. Under the guidance and loving care of such men as these, laboring under the inspiration of our Father in heaven, and with the help of such men as now constitute the General Board, the great work of building character, and of implanting a testimony of the gospel in the hearts of the youth of Israel, must succeed.
