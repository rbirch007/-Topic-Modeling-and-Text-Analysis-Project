A Business Man's Appreciation of President Heber J. Grant Horace G. Whitney
======================================================================

President Heber J. Grant and his Counselors A BUSINESS MAN'S APPRECIATION OF PRESIDENT. HEBER J. GRANT Horace G. Whitney In compliance with your request that I write a few words relative to the life and character of our new President, I am reminded that today, December 1st, is an anniversary of deep interest both to his family and mine, one that has often been commented on by both of us. It was on December 1, 1856, sixty-two years ago, that the wedding of my father and mother was being celebrated in a little social party in this city. While the festivities were at their height, some one opened the door and gravely announced, "Jeddy is dead." The party broke up at once. "Jeddy" was known the over familiar name and by breadth the width which ofHeber J. Grant's the state. He wasfather was as active a figure in the religious and business life of the community as his son is today, and his sudden death plunged all circles into deepest mourning. Heber was then only nine days old. All his life thus has been passed without a father. But he had a mother who gave him a care and training of the most devoted nature. As long as she remained on earth, the tie between her and her son was marvelous in its beauty and strength. In boyhood days, our little circle of boys were greatly given to visiting each other's homes. It is a fine memory with all of us to recall how our mothers interested themselves in the companions of their sons. I well remember how Heber J. Grant's associates loved "Aunt Rachel" for her angelic disposition, and respected Heber J. for his devotion to her. That is the strongest impression I retain of our early boyhood association. Another is the old school days in the University 66 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. of Deseret, then conducted by Dr. John R. Park in the Council House which stood on the Deseret News corner. Most of us had but a brief scholastic career  life was too exigent in those days to allow much time for the acquirement of an education,  but Heber J. Grant's associates of 11, 12, 13 and 14 years of age, such as Orson F. Whitney, Richard W. Young, Feramorz Young, Heber M. Wells, B. S. Young, Alonzo Young and myself (to name only the closest intimates) knew what it was to "plug" day and night to reach their goals. The dominant characteristics of Heber J. Grant in those days were ceaseless perseverance and intense application to his tasks, and to one task in particular, that of becoming an expert penman. How well he succeeded is well known to his business associates, and the skill he developed in rare penmanship enabled him to earn many a dollar to assist his widowed mother. The same intensity was applied to other pursuits, even to the favorite sport of the day, baseball. He made up his mind to become an expert first baseman, and the astonishing amount of time he devoted to practicing for that position was the admiration of all his companions. Later he became one of the famous "Red Stockings" which vanquished the state champions, the "Deserets," and rose to the foremost pinnacle of fame in the local sporting world. Those were the achievements of boyhood days, but they all aided in laying the foundation for the wider career and the greater responsibilities that came with manhood. Heber J. Grant's religious activities are too well known to need describing. More than any of his boyhood companions, he followed serious and religious pursuits, and as a boy he was always active in Church affairs. His appointment as President of Tooele stake came when he was only 23 years of age, and he was chosen an Apostle under President John Taylor before he was 26. Since that time, he has been an indefatigable toiler for his Church, and has spent many years in the foreign service, opening the mission to Japan, and presiding over the European mission. My principal connection with him has been in the business world, where he has been as active and unwearying a worker as in the religious field. As founder of the Utah Home Fire Insurance Company, organizer of the State Bank of Utah, and one of the fathers of the Consolidated Wagon & Machine Company, three of the state's most successful institutions today (to say nothing of the other prosperous concerns with which he is connected) he evinced the keen discernment, the broad judgment and the enterprising spirit which were always his characteristics. His labors in organizing the first sugar company in Utah are well known in the business world. He took a leading part in raising the capital for that institution, and has always remained one of its most PRESIDENT GRANT AND HIS COUNSELORS. 67 loyal supporters. In the conduct of the old Salt Lake Herald, when it was the organ of the People's Party, and when the late Byron Groo and myself were associated with him, he showed the same ze'al, with the result that that period stands out as probably the only one in the checkered career of that publication, when it was in the dividend-paying class. His energy extended even to the editorial columns, and (what is not generally known) he often furnished the ideas and sometimes the articles themselves which appeared as the "leaders" in that journal. From the association of those times, reaching back nearly thirty-five years and extending down to the present, I can say unreservedly that the big reason iof President Grant's success has been his observance of the rule of the square deal, and his fair and generous treatment of friend and opponent alike. If he has a fault, it is his inordinate genibrosity to those he loves  a trait that alone has kept him from Hecoming a man of wealth. But I never knew a man who cared less for money, and the only times I have ever heard him regret mat he had so little was when he wished to lead out and set th| example to others in some of the many charitable enterprises He was called on to promote. His name was never lacking in by good cause, and whether it was saving a financial institution to preserve the good name of his friends, starting a Liberty Loan drive, or keeping some poor widow's roof over her head fa chapter alone might be devoted to that subject), the signature of Heber J. Grant, like the name, of Abou Ben Adhem, "led all the rest." I have every confidence that in assuming the high and responsible position to which he has been called, he will exercise the breadth of judgment, the keenness, the liberality, and the indefatigable industry which have always distinguished himi and which are bound to make his administration a success.
