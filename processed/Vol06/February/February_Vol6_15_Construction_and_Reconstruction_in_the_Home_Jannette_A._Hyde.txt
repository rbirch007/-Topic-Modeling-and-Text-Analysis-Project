Construction and Reconstruction in the Home. Janette A. Hyde. HOME DRESSMAKING. Note: These lessons are planned to give help to the women who do their own sewing at home, and the suggestions given are based upon experience among home sewers and a knowledge of the common mistakes made by them for want of more professional knowledge along these lines. Beautiful materials are often completely ruined in shape and workmanship. The questions asked by many women who would like to be more successful is, "How shall I proceed? And what shall I do first?" Note: The designs and instructions of this department have been provided by Mrs. Lucille Young MacAllister, Home Demonstrator, of the B. Y. U., of the Box Elder High School, and in the Government Extension work of the U. A. C. The Form as an Aid in Dressmaking. Learning to use a form for fitting and drafting is the only solution to the difficult question of fitting oneself. It does away with the tedious, discouraging attempts to correct faults in the garment in places where you can neither see nor reach. If the dress form used is exactly like your own figure, you need scarcely to try the dress on until it is finished. If mothers, who wish their daughters to sew for themselves, would provide the girls with forms to use while they are learning, they would not be so easily discouraged, as so many are, because they realize that they are not entirely successful and their results are not all that the fastidious tastes of the up-to-date young lady requires. How to Make the Form. Purchase three or three and a half yards of grey cambric lining. Out of this cut a French basque to the waistline, a circular 105 CONSTRUCTION IN THE HOME. piece or peplum to fit from the waist line to six or seven inches below the hip line, a plain two-piece sleeve, and a four inch bias piece for the stand-up collar. Basque patterns may be bought in any standard make of patterns. Figure I. The Dress Form. The above illustration shows a dress form constructed and padded according to the method described on the opposite page. It will be necessary to secure the assistance of someone with experience in fitting, to fit this lining until it is perfect in shape. The better the fit of the lining the more satisfactory the form will be when the collar and peplum are fitted. Note the lines showing where the collar and peplum are completed. After the fitting of the lining has been carefully completed, trim the seams to an even distance from the basting and mark all 106 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. joining points with notching or with chalk. If this trimming and marking is very carefully done, the lining may be taken apart without danger of losing the shape. By taking all the seams apart you will be able to cut a pattern from this fitted lining, which will be invaluable in your cutting and which may be used as a foundation for cutting all styles of waists, sleeves and skirts, as will be shown later. The use of cloth for the pattern will be found to be far more satisfactory than paper. Cloth patterns are durable and more easily folded for changes in cutting. Figure II. The Pattern. The top row shows the pieces of half of the French basque. The bottom row shows half the peplum and the two pieces of the tight sleeve. Note the notches on all pieces of the pattern. When the pattern has been cut, put the pieces of the lining carefully together again, first basting, then sewing the seams on the machine. Use hook and eye tape for fastening down the CONSTRUCTION IN THE HOME. 107 center of the front. It is now ready to place on the foundation. The best foundation obtainable is a regular dress form or a discarded corset display for one or two sizes smaller than your bust measure calls for. Then the lining will fit the form loose enough to allow for all small peculiarities of your own figure. Next pad the lining out until there are no wrinkles or bumps but a perfectly smooth surface. The padding must be stuffed in tight enough to give firmness, for if it is loose and slips from place to place the form will never be satisfactory. As material for padding, one may use discarded paper patterns or even well crumpled newspaper, cotton and fine excelsior are also good. The arm eye may be covered with cloth as shown in Fig. 1. If you are unable to secure a form to use for a foundation, it is possible to use a strip of wood about two inches square, placed upright and several inches longer than the lining. Seven or eight inches below the upper arm securely fasten a cross piece as a foundation for the shoulders. A shorter cross piece can be used in the waistline and one lower down in the hipline. The length and distance apart of the three crosspieces must be governed by proportions of the figure to be duplicated. When the cross pieces are adjusted, stuff the entire lining with excelsior. An oval shaped board placed in the bottom and fastened to the upright will help to keep the shape. In following this latter method of making a form, it is necessary to use a heavier lining than the cambric. The fitted sleeve pattern is only for use in cutting. The waist pattern should be notched where the inseam of the sleeve should come, and several notches over the upper part of the armhole in both sleeve and waist will greatly assist in setting the sleeve in properly and will be especially helpful to amateurs. Where there are a number of women in the family one form as a foundation may be made to suffice for all, by providing each one with a fitted lining and having the form small enough for the smallest one. The larger ones will, of course, require more padding. Have a fitted pattern, if not a form. Women who, for some reason, are unable to construct the form can at least have a fitted pattern consisting of the pieces shown in Fig. II. In the following issue the use of this basque pattern, as a foundation for cutting waists, will be treated. ON THE
