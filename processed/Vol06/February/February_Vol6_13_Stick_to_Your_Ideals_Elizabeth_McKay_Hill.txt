Stick to Your Ideals Elizabeth McKay Hill
======================================================================

Stick to Your Ideals. Elisabeth McKay Hill, Dean of Women, Utah Agricultural College We are passing through one of the most critical periods of the world's history  that of complete readjustment. Governments of the world are being reconstructed; the largest armaments ever known are being demobilized; the greatest number of human beings are being fed; the world of industry is being reorganized; the social atmosphere of the world needs purifying. What are we, or what have we to contribute to make us fit to live at such a time? What are our ideals? Are they those of the early pioneers who were willing to sacrifice everything, including life itself, for honor? If they are, then "stick to them," for those ideals were founded on truth, and in proportion as our lives are in harmony with truth, in that proportion can we render valuable service in the solution of the world's problems, which today, more than ever, are our individual problems. How many of us as individuals, or how many children are being taught "to allow every one the liberty of conscience" or that "the Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard; it is founded in the wisdom of God?" Why not, as families, turn part of our loyal enthusiasm to the studying of the Constitution of our Government, so that we may better serve as citizens, and so that the generation under our care may be stronger to cope with the problems of government that when the time comes that the "Constitution will be held as by a silken thread" there may be those trained to defend it intelligently? The men who are being demobilized today are coming home bigger, broader and better citizens  they have learned the true meaning of democracy  to recognize the man for what he is, not what fortune might have bestowed upon him. What are we as women doing to open our eyes of understanding so that we might recognize true character even though it be garbed in rags? "Save, save, save," not of that part which we should give to the neighbor, but of that part which we consume and waste needlessly. Our crops are plentiful, but we have never known the time when we were not told to be prepared to feed the stranger and that preparation can be made daily. Since the withdrawal of food regulations fear has been expressed that there would be unnecessary consumption, we as a people, if we are true to our ideals, ought not to need "food regulations." Carefully store that which our neighbors across the water do not need and which we can just as well get along without. STICK TO YOUR IDEALS. 97 The teaching of " '47" was, "Those who don't work, don't eat." A great deal of our social unrest is due to the fact that there are those among all classes of men who fail to do their share of the every-day things of life  daughters in the home, sons on the farm, women in society, men in every walk in life fail to appreciate that "he who is greatest among you serves most." What do we know of the labor problem as we face it today? And in what measure can we help solve it? We know the teaching that has come to us from past generations, the plan of having all things in common, but we also know for that plan to succeed each individual  that means me, and that means you  must cooperate unselfishly and must work unceasingly. Are we any less selfish today than we were yesterday? If not, are we prepared to help solve the industrial problem? We have always maintained a single standard of purity, and the time was that a man's Hfe paid the price of a woman's chastity, and so long as such standards were maintained the safety of a nation was secure. We cannot compromise with sin and not strike at the home, the very foundation of a nation's safety. Let us teach our girls and our boys that virtue is dearer than life itself and that "the wages of sin is death." MY SYMPHONY. Grace Ingles Frost. Just to take whate'er shall come of rain or shine,  Graciously, As part Unto of me God's; great will divine. To walk the way He leadeth me along, With smiling lips, Thro' comradship with pain grown brave and strong, That they in after years whose feet may press The selfsame wood. Shall find their soul's distress. Their irksome load. Diminished by the blossoms strewn before, And seeing, travel on and doubt no more. THE
