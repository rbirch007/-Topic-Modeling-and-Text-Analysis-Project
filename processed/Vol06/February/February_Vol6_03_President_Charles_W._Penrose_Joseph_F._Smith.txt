President Charles W. Penrose Joseph F. Smith
======================================================================

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. Joseph F. Smith. A wonderful character is President Charles W. Penrose. Although eighty-seven years of age, he is just as keen of intellect and quick of wit as he was in the days of his youth. At least so I judge, for I did not know him in the days of his early manhood, and he is old enough to be my grandfather. This I do know, however, that there is little that escapes his attention, and he is always ready to give a good sound reason on any subject which he may discuss. Never does he ramble nor lose sight of the point of discussion, but with the great power of concentration which he possesses tenaciously holds on and uses no unnecessary words. PRESIDENT GRANT AND HIS COUNSELORS. 72 His power of perception and ability to analyze and arrange facts in order has been a marvel to me. This is due both to inherent ability and to a long training in the world of journalism and the mission field. In his early youth he spent ten years in the British mission as a traveling elder, preaching the gospel, organizing branches, and giving his time to the ministry, with a devotion that was admirable in the fullest degree. After emigrating to Zion his time was spent in various pursuits, but after a three years mission he was called into the field of journalism, where many of the best years of his life have been spent. And who in Zion has not profited by his writings? His forceful editorials and writings on gospel themes have left their imprint on the lives of thousands. Well do I remember while laboring in the mission field the convincing power of his series of terse, plain and impressive Rays of Living Light, which were used universally by the elders. He possesses a power of directness and clearness of thought in his speech that is unsurpassed which has caused me to marvel and to wish that I could follow his example. When he stands before a congregation all who are acquainted with him know, before a word is spoken, that they will be edified by hearing the gospel preached in clearness and power, and that he will drive home with telling force the truth he wishes to convey. His services in the Legislature as Representative, stand on record to his lasting credit and renown. His knowledge of the scriptures has greatly impressed me, and his understanding of the gospel is deep and broad. Though strong in his convictions and, like the proverbial Highlander, hard to turn when once he gets going, yet when shown the better way he is willing to change his view; yet rare, indeed, is the occasion for such a change. When he knows he is right no power on earth can turn him from his purpose. His conviction of the gospel has passed from belief to knowledge, and is so firmly fixed that it is everlasting. As a poet and as a writer of prose, he ranks among the great. The hymn, "Zion"  "Oh ye mountains high," may be placed among the foremost of our poems. Scarcely does a Sabbath pass when this hymn is not sung in one or more places throughout the Church. Yet it was written before the author ever looked upon the "vales of the free" with the natural eye. "School thy feelings, O my brother," is another hymn whose beauty and depth of sentiment make it universal in its appeal and charm. These are not all, for there are many more such poetic gems. The striking feature in his poems, as I see them, is their expressions of love and loyalty for Zion and her cause. "Beautiful Zion for me," "Blow gently, ye wild winds," "O wouldst thou from bondage and strife be free," "Should solemn covenants be forgot," 74 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. and "Up, awake, ye defenders of Zion!" are examples of this thought. It is no easy task for a man to leave father, mother and all that is dear in the world for the gospel's sake. The Lord has said that "he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. * * * And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me." All this President Penrose was called upon to do. In his youth, when the light of the gospel came to him, he received it gladly. His soul was converted to its truth. It was what he had been looking for, and the Spirit of the Lord bore witness with convincing power to him that he had found the way to eternal life; but in following in the way, he was forced to stand alone, forsaken by all his house. He was an outcast for the truth. Strange it is, that the message of eternal salvation, so plain and simple that he who runs may read, falls on deaf ears that cannot understand. The fact that he could come out of Babylon, forsaken by all that was dear to him in the world, because the Lord had spoken, calls forth my greatest admiration. "He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake," said the Master, "shall find it." So it is, and so shall it be, with Charles W. Penrose. The Lord has seen the integrity of his heart and has blessed him with an hundred fold in this life and his meed of glory in the eternal life hereafter is sure to come.
