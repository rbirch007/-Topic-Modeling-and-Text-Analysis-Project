The Establishment of the Relief Society in Utah

Louisa W. Luke

HE history of the Relief Society is largely a history of the noble women who gave their all for the establishment of an institution which was founded, under the guidance of the Lord, by the Prophet Joseph Smith himself. The years that followed the organization on March 17, 1842, were, for the saints, crucial ones. During the persecutions the Society must have filled a great need. The call was to give aid and succor to the poor, sick, and needy, and to inspire to good works all the members.

After the death of the Prophet and the fast-moving events that followed, there were no formal meetings but, as Emmeline B. Wells tells us, the spirit of the work went forward and the women kept in their hearts the desire and urge to aid and comfort each other. Especial mention is made of the service rendered by Vilate Kimball, Eliza R. Snow, Mary Ann Young, and Elizabeth A. Whitney, all these women having been in the organization under Emma Hale Smith, as president. They had little of material aid, but their loving service and spiritual strength helped many a family over the sorrows and trials at the time of the exodus.

Those were days when the women were very close to each other. They were welcomed by the sick and sorrowful as they went from wagon to wagon on the long trek to the Rocky Mountains. Great spiritual Page 162 strength came to them and they lived close to each other and close to their Father in heaven. There was an exaltation to their lives as they endured hardships and privations, sickness and death, because they were unified in their purposes, in their faith, and in their loyalties to their leaders.

We reap the results of the strength and activity of these men and women in the great commonwealth of today. No people could have developed widespread communities from the desert and the wilderness as they did, had they not had spiritual strength from God, unity in their purpose, and loyalty to each other.

It may seem strange that a few years elapsed between the exodus and the general holding of Relief Society meetings in the new territory. We know that during those years women were carrying on the work. They were aiding the sick, feeding the hungry, teaching the gospel, improving their minds, and all the while carrying on with the hard labor that goes into the establishment of a new community.

The earliest organizations after the saints came West were made in 1851 and 1852, when scattered Societies were established and the sisters came together to assist each other in sewing and nursing, and to clothe the Indians. In 1855, President Young called upon the bishops to organize a Society in each ward. Among others, there is a record of Bishop Ara Hoagland of the Fourteenth Ward, Salt Lake City, organizing a Relief Society September 14, 1856, with Phoebe W. Woodruff as president.

The work was interrupted, however, by the coming of Johnston's Army in 1858.

LIZA R. Snow had found her place among the saints many years before, but these new developments gave her an enlarged opportunity to serve, to express herself, and to use her talents to the fullest. She was a most unusual woman, and in her day there were few with the energy and courage to express themselves in writing and speech as she did.

When the Relief Society was organized in Nauvoo, on March 17, 1842, by the Prophet, Eliza was called to the position of secretary. In the succeeding years, she had carried on her duties as a keeper of the records and as a social worker. In 1866, President Young assigned Eliza and Zina D. H. Young the work of aiding the bishops in organizing a Relief Society in every ward and branch in the Church. They traveled over the Territory, enduring the hardships and privations of travel in those days.

This was the real beginning of the work of coordinating and directing Relief Society activities from a central organization. Thus Eliza's life was full of great and varied activity. All her talents for writing, for helping her sisters, and for leadership were developed and put into service. This was preparation for the important position she was to hold in the last years of her life.

On June 19, 1880, the first central organization of the Relief Society was formed, with Eliza R. Snow as president, Zina D. H. Young and Elizabeth Ann Whitney as counselors, Sarah M. Kimball as secretary, and M. Isabella Horne as treasurer. These women had been schooled and tested for many years in the field of service to their fellow men and to their God. Their faith was deep and true. Their spiritual strength was powerful and enduring, and their talents were many.

It was a fitting choice that President Young made at that time and he laid a firm foundation for the modern Relief Society that has grown and become a great power for good in these sixty-seven years since the first central organization was formed. Eliza R. Snow served as president until her death on December 5, 1887. Her whole life of service stands as a monument to her, and her fine writings tell the story of the efforts and achievements of her people and herself.

At the death of Eliza R. Snow, Zina D. H. Young was called to the Relief Society presidency. Like Eliza, she came of New England parentage. She, too, bent all her efforts toward the intellectual advancement and betterment of living conditions of her people. In May of 1848 she began the journey to Salt Lake, walking, driving teams, and sharing in all the hardships of the saints at the time of the exodus. She taught the young, inspiring them to learn and to be active in their community.

In 1870, at the call of President Young, she raised silkworms and established silk culture in the new Territory. In June of 1876 she began a course of medical studies which helped fit her for Relief Society work in her own home and in the homes of the community. In the home of Brigham Young she was known as "the doctor." Her interest in home nursing inspired other sisters to come from different settlements to follow her example. Relief Society has ever since had a corps of trained women in the organization to meet the responsibilities and emergencies that present themselves.

Zina was skilled in all types of women's work and was equal to all the requirements made of her. As mentioned above, she traveled, visited, organized, and assisted Eliza in the great beginning of Relief Society in the early days. She was an example of inspiration to women. At a mass meeting of women in Salt Lake City, November 16, 1878, Zina delivered an eloquent impromptu address that stirred and amazed her hearers. One of the reporters said:

"I raised my eyes to her standing just before the table we were using. Suddenly, as I glanced at her, I received a strong electric shock, several gentlemen sitting at my right-hand, clutching the arms of the chairs, started as though they would rise to their feet, their faces burning with the truths they heard, their eyes fixed upon her fearless face and uplifted hands. I can never forget that moment. It was more than eloquence, it was inspiration."

We must marvel at the strength our pioneer women had, and we realize that their power lay in their worthiness and faithfulness; faith so profound that they received great blessings from God. The history of these women stands as a testimony to these facts: that God was with them, that their cause was just, and that their mission was to establish and further great institutions.

Eliza R. Snow and Zina D. H. Young, the early Relief Society presidents in Utah, gave to the organization much inspiration and spiritual impetus as well as many practical methods of organization for the carrying out of specific projects which were entirely new to the women of that time. These two leaders, with scores of other early Relief Society leaders, freely gave of their special gifts and talents to the Society. Because of their faith, amplified by their hard work and great courage, these leaders were able to overcome obstacles, to encourage their sisters in the face of frontier hardships, and to advance and direct the cause of the great women's organization.

Much of the inspiration that guided them will continue to influence the women of the Church, and the work that the early leaders have done will always be a source of great strength to the Relief Society and a foundation upon which the Society can grow and improve.

RECOGNITION FOR RELIEF SOCIETY

A communication from Germany bearing the following interesting address was recently received at the general offices of Relief Society:

GREATEST WOMEN ASSOCIATION
Salt Lake City Nevada, U. S. A.
The Visitors Fay Tarlock 

THE news came during breakfast. The First Counselor telephoned that, in the absence of the Stake President, he wished my parents to entertain the daughter of Brigham Young and the wife of a millionaire; and that the illustrious ladies would arrive from Panguitch at about noon, to give a week's course in some special Church work.

So began the enchanted week! Even today tiny details remain clear—the brightness of the summer morning, the music of the canyon stream, and the figures of my mother and my older sisters as they rushed upstairs and down. The ingrain carpet from the largest bedroom was taken up, beaten, and turned. The entire room was scrubbed, and the curtains and spreads swiftly laundered. My sisters worried about the beds. The springs were known to sag in the middle, but, after all, there was a bed for each lady, and so a little sag wouldn't hurt. Thorough cleanings were given the parlor and dining room.

Then, merciful goodness! The large picture of Brigham Young, which had long ago adorned the living room, was found to be hanging at the dark end of the upstairs hallway. Father and mother spoke in favor of bringing it right down to the parlor to hang by Bonheur's horses. The sisters said no, definitely. It would look as if we were trying to impress. After a quick debate, the picture was placed in what was once honored to be the guest room, but which had evolved into a haven for old books and magazines and the winter's supply of dried fruit and corn.

Everything was done now, my mother said, except cleaning the sitting room. This room was a perpetual clutter of family living. My skin was tight with pride when I called Mother to see what I had done unaided while the others were working.

In the kitchen there was a last-minute scurry to prepare the vegetables.

Then we all changed into clean summer dresses and Father put on his second-best pants, and sat on the front porch to await the arrival. We were not as calm as we looked.

For me it was as if someone had rubbed the magic lamp. Susa Young Gates and Elizabeth Claridge McCune were coming to our home! High Church people had been in our home before, but none so eminent as Mrs. Gates, a celebrity in her own right, in addition to her famous name. And the McCune name was a fabulous one. Rich people, I thought, were of a different world. Their manners, their dress, their very ways of thinking were beyond us. Yet tonight Mrs. McCune would sleep in my bed.

Page 165-166

It was not a long wait. Soon there came the noise of a car bumping its way to our street. Out of the dust emerged the First Counselor's car. The First Counselor, dark and dignified, opened the rear car door for two passengers, swathed in gray-linen dusters and veils. As they came towards us under the shade of the mulberry trees, they shook the red dust of Southern Utah from their clothes. Another year or so, and cars would be gliding over smooth roads. This day, however, some of our roads had a kinship with pioneer trails. The First Counselor brought the ladies hurriedly down the gravel walk to the front porch. He told the ladies, not without anxiety in his well-bred voice, that he was sorry the Stake President was away. They would, he felt sure, be comfortable with Brother and Sister Ollerton. Then he made a hasty exit, his very back showing his relief.

The ladies, still swathed in veils, sat in the porch chairs. Among their bags was a large one with foreign labels. My hands itched to touch it. Father, as if he read my thoughts, picked up this bag and a still larger one, and started towards the stairs. Mrs. McCune, a slender, gray-haired woman, rose to follow him. Mrs. Gates, whose hair was a more beautiful gray, and who was heavier in figure, did not rise. Other than her brief greeting, she had been silent. Now she lifted her right hand, and in the voice of one used to command she said, "Elizabeth! Wait a moment!" Startled, as were we all, Mrs. McCune came back. What could be wrong with our house? It was a white brick one, made of the best native materials and put together by the best craftsmen in Parowan. Guiltily, I thought of the sagging springs. No, Mrs. Gates could not know of them.

Father was silent and puzzled. With us, he waited for the pronouncement, which came after a long, dramatic pause. "We are requested to stay with the Stake President," said the daughter of Brigham Young. Father started to say something, changed his mind, and set down the luggage. He went to the telephone, fastened on the wall. After he had cranked the handle and contacted central, there was a slight wait, probably to give the First Counselor time to get inside his house. Father stated his message almost as briefly and firmly as Mrs. Gates. Turning from the telephone, he told the ladies the First Counselor would come at once. Then with a suaveness of which we were proud, he sat down to entertain the ladies. He inquired about the journey, commiserating with them over the roughness of the roads, the heat, the dust. Mrs. McCune laughed, lightly and melodiously, as a great lady should. "I told Susa this morning," she answered, "that when we got to the railroad, I would faint in the arms of the first Pullman porter."

Mother excused herself quietly and came back with a pitcher of ice water. Nowadays, ice water would be only a common courtesy, but that day it was a social triumph. There were few ice houses in Southern Utah, and we had one. The ladies fairly seized upon the water, unable to believe the tinkle really meant ice. Then father asked Mrs. McCune about her father, recalling a time long past. "Ah, my dear Father," she said, and smiled wistfully as she told of him.

THE VISITORS

Turning to Mrs. Gates, father asked her about some men in Utah's political life. Deftly he maneuvered the conversation to inquire if she were still writing. "It is time," he said, "that you gave us another John Stevens' Courtship." A light came into Mrs. Gates' eyes. She fairly scintillated as she talked. I could not take my eyes from her spirited face; her vibrant voice was like a spell.

The chugging of the First Counselor's car was an unwelcome interruption. He told the ladies he would be only too happy to have them as his guests until the Stake President returned. Reaching for the bags, his gesture invited the ladies to rise. Mrs. McCune, on the edge of her chair, was poised for instant flight. Only Mrs. Gates was immobile. "We will stay with Brother Ollerton," she said, facing the now thoroughly mystified First Counselor, who stayed only long enough to tell the ladies he would call for them at two o'clock and convey them to the schoolhouse.

Mrs. McCune, with a light step, ran ahead of my father and the bags. Mrs. Gates, walking behind, was dignified, her head high. I wondered if the picture should not be hanging in the parlor, after all.

THE NEXT MORNING, AND EACH MORNING THEREAFTER, I smoothed my braids, put on a clean apron, and knocked at the visitors' door. At my feet were two enormous white pitchers, one filled with warm water, one with cold. Pridefully I announced that first morning that by next summer there would be running water in the house, from the soon-to-be 157 water system.

This did not elicit so much as a raised eyebrow from the ladies. I suspect now that they were a little weary of performing their ablutions in water from a pitcher. That was the last and only disappointment they gave me.

The week became a veritable Arabian Night's entertainment, with two gifted Scheherazades to make each minute seem a second. No two women could have been more charming or gracious guests. Totally unlike, they had a genuine love for each other, and they gave generously from the rich store of their past. It was a quieter and a more innocent day. There were no radios; the movies were not common. The townspeople, awed, perhaps, by the luster surrounding the ladies, gave no entertainment for them. It may be that the ladies themselves requested quiet because of the labor of long classes. Whatever the reasons, we had them to ourselves during the late afternoons and evenings.

Nights we sat in the parlor, leaving the doors open to catch the canyon breezes. The room was a large one with a rose-splattered, axminster rug, white woodwork, and ecru net curtains.

For furniture there were bookcases, a parlor organ, a congress chair, and a round table, made long ago by Parowan's cooperative society, a low-hanging wooden chandelier, wicker chairs, and a leather sofa bought from Sears and Roebuck. I thought it a charming room. The mealtimes were also memorable. The food was wonderful—fruit and vegetables fresh from the orchard and garden. There was thick cream, butter, freshly churned, and ice cream made on the back porch, along with homemade bread, 168 cakes, and pies. Chickens came from our hen house. In the morning there were omelettes, garnished with bacon and ham, home-cured. Mother brought out her best relishes and jellies to accompany her snowy Irish linen and her china with the wild-rose pattern. When the sign "Fresh beef for sale here" appeared in a local store window, we had roasts and steaks. At first, Mrs. Gates came only to the noonday dinner; it being her custom to eat but one meal a day. One evening, however, she was in the parlor walking back and forth in her long black dress. "Is that what you have for supper every night?" she asked, stopping suddenly, and peering through the arch that separated her from the dining room. "Yes, every night," answered Mrs. McCune, "and it gets better every meal." Mother brought out an extra service and adjusted our seating to give Mrs. Gates her accustomed place at the foot of the table. From then on her conversation enriched every meal.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1948

Much of what they talked about was over my head, but I listened breathlessly. I sensed the things of which they talked—the universal problems of the human mind. Contact with Mrs. Gates' bright intellect stirred something within me for the first time.

Best of the conversations were about travel. Even as a small child, I had a strong urge to see the world. Now the door opened slightly for me. Enchanted, I moved through art galleries and cathedrals. In awe, I watched the Pope give audiences in the Vatican. And I was silent before the Roman graves of Keats and Shelley.

Mrs. Gates was a leader in the fight for women's rights. She had represented the women of the Church and of Utah on many a valiant battleground. Thirteen times she had crossed the continent in a chair car as a spokesman for some Utah organization. I can still hear her clear voice telling us that she went via chair car because there had been no money to waste on Pullmans.

Mrs. McCune, who had a light heart and a delightful wit, told of being in London with a Utah friend whom I shall call Mrs. X. Mrs. X came in one day all aflutter. She had been invited by a member of Parliament to have tea in the House of Commons. Mrs. McCune was to go, also.

"Now, Elizabeth," pleaded Mrs. X, "for goodness sakes, forget the Word of Wisdom for once. I could never stand the humiliation if you refuse tea."

"I didn't want to humiliate anyone," Mrs. McCune told us. "I said that I would try to be wise and ask for a cup of hot water." They went to the House of Commons. Mrs. X sent up her card. They waited, Mrs. X nervous in her anticipation. The nervousness turned to anxiety. Still no reply.

"I couldn't stand to see her disappointed," Mrs. McCune related, "so I told her that we would go over to the House of Lords. I knew a member there." They went to the House of Lords, and were received by a duke who had been a guest of the McCunes in South America. For tea he took them to a terrace overlooking St. James Park and Buckingham Palace.

"You," said the duke, in his charming way, "do not drink tea."

Bowin' to Mrs. X, he smiled and said, "I am acquainted with the habits of Utah people. For the three of us today I shall order a special lemonade." That was a lesson to me. I could see the trio so plainly—a duke, with two ladies dressed in silk and ostrich plumes and white kid gloves, sipping lemonade on the terrace.

Mrs. Gates took the mantel of Scheherazade. She told us a tale of a European tour in the company of the McCunes, her daughter Emma Lucy, and a number of Utah girls. Emma Lucy was a music student enjoying a holiday. It has never been my pleasure to know Mrs. Bowen. But she is a vivid part of my early memories. To me she is always a fair-haired girl with a golden voice and a radiant smile.

All over Europe the other girls complained about the hotels, the trains, and foreigners in general, in the true tourist manner, but Emma Lucy of the golden voice enjoyed it all. One day, because she did not "grizzle," Mrs. McCune gave her a golden guinea. A guinea in those days bought something.

There was the delightful story of Mrs. McCune's daughter who had five children and lived in France. A policeman tried to arrest her because she was running a school without a license. Five children, in Parowan, was a small family. And there was the guide in the catacombs. He was frankly showing off his European polish and gift of language before the stupid one-tongued Americans.

Mrs. McCune listened to him all through the dark 169 catacombs, then she turned to him and asked him a question in the tongue of the Ute Indians. There was one deflated guide.

I was not all sitting at the feet of these captivating storytellers. There was work to be done! I had to churn. How I hated that churning! Turning the handle of the big yellow churn while the cream slowly thickened and broke into globs of golden butter was a weary process. I was at the tedious routine when Mrs. McCune came to the back porch.

"Would you let me turn it just a minute?" she asked me, as if it were a favor. I was aghast. Surely no one in her right mind would want to churn unless it were a necessity, but I relinquished the handle. She lifted the lid.

"Oh, beautiful!" "Oh, beautiful!"

"You wouldn't think it was beautiful if you had to do it as often as I do," I countered, twisting my apron.

She smiled, and I know now that there was nostalgia in her smile. "I have done it many times," she told me, "not with a churn like this, but one with a heavy dasher."

Smiling still, she turned the handle until the butter was formed. After that I felt there might be a faint hope that I, too, could escape spending all my days with a chum.

But I would never call it beautiful. Later, I was to learn more about Elizabeth McCune.

Her story is one of the great Cinderella sagas, a motherless girl who had lived on the so-called Muddy Mission in Nevada. With the slender hands that I saw wearing diamonds, she had helped and rhapsodized about building an adobe house with her father. As a young married woman, she had lived above a little store in a Utah village. 'Then, suddenly, just as in the fairy stories, she was wealthy beyond all thoughts of avarice. She traveled the world over, had a great home in Salt Lake City, and how many others I don't know, and knew the great and the near-great of the world. Always, she had the ability to adapt herself without sacrificing her integrity. "When you hear that I am no longer of that big wickiup in Salt Lake," she told us, "you will know that it is the happiest day of my life." She wanted a bungalow on a quiet side street. I had an extra duty that week, a duty I did not relish. It was to protect Mrs. Gates from the cattle of Patowan. Occasionally a cow or calf would go astray when it was turned into the street for its watering. Often as not some owner would allow his calf to graze the grass off the sidewalks and streets. On our own place, calves were forever on the lawns or in the orchard. Whenever Mrs. Gates walked about, I accompanied her, armed with a stout stick. At home, I did not mind. I could giggle about it secretly with my sister Sadie, but the day I had to escort the ladies uptown, I was downright humiliated. It was washday. Mother made it known to some of the Relief Society sisters that she wished the visitors invited to dinner. A dear, gentle lady who was related to a high Church family offered her home. We walked the six blocks in the hot noonday sun; I going ahead with my stout stick. There was only one calf abroad; it was dozing in the shade. Hurriedly, I left the ladies at RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1948. The week was racing along. One night, unannounced, the Stake President came with his wife. They had returned only an hour earlier and had come to offer their home to the ladies. 'Their house was a large one, far better furnished than ours. The Stake President himself was an engaging man, with a charming little wife of Scotch descent, witty and generous. I was fearful lest the visitors would decide to go. Again we were all waiting for Mrs. Gates to speak. Never one to lounge, she was sitting upright in the wicker chair. Quite casually, she faced the Stake President, thanked him, and said she would not think of leaving. Mrs. McCune said quickly that she preferred to remain with us. My heart was suddenly light. THAT night Father got Mrs. Gates to talk about her writing. She was a woman of tremendous vitality. When she talked, she imparted some of it to us. I think we would have stayed up all night without tiring. John Stevens' Courtship had not been mentioned since the first day. It was Father's opinion that this book was the best one thus far to come from Utah writers. He wanted to know about its writing. Much of what she told us is gone from me, but I do remember that the fair-haired heroine was drawn from life, with her daughter, the present Mrs. Widtsoe, as the model. She told us that all of the incidents connected with the United States Army were based on actual happenings. The last day came too soon. Dinner was special, with the best of everything. My sister Anne, who has a light hand with pies, made her choicest. Each was given a generous fourth. We ate the pie almost in silence, a tribute to its delectableness. The silence was shattered by a sudden noise from the foot of the table. It was made by Mrs. Gates clapping her hands together. "Anne!" she called in the vigorous tone I was to hear many times later in Utah tabernacles. Anne hurried in from the kitchen, a startled look on her face. "What other kind of pie have you?" the lady wanted to know. "Lemon," answered Anne, relieved. Mrs. Gates dropped her hand on the table in her regal gesture and said, "I will take a piece." There was a dreadful moment when Sadie and I might have forever disgraced our house by giggling. Not even the pressure of Mother's foot could save us. It was Mrs. McCune who did. "T, too, will have another piece," she said to Anne, just in time. Father immediately ordered a second. It ended with all of us having another piece. Right after dinner, Mrs. McCune followed Anne into the kitchen. When that lady had gone upstairs, my sister came in to say in a low voice that Mrs. McCune had invited her to stay at the McCune home during the coming Teachers' Institute. How wonderful, I thought. Mrs. Gates had told us about the great stone house with its pink satin and gold ballroom, the crystal chandeliers, and marble statues brought from Italy. She had made us feel the soft thickness of the velvet rugs, 171 had described the oil paintings from famous masters. And there were bathrooms for almost every bedroom! Yet Anne did not want to go. She was fearful of the elegance and did not want Mrs. McCune to feel that she was obligated to invite her. Mother did not know how to advise her. It was Mrs. Gates, with her understanding heart, who helped in the decision. She told Anne that Mrs. McCune sincerely wanted her. "You do not get opportunities like this many times," she appealed. "You will feel as much at home in Elizabeth's mansion as we have felt in your home." Anne went, taking a cousin with her. Both of them enjoyed every minute. It made a perfect ending to our enchanted week to hear first-hand about the ballroom and the servants who even made the beds. The last day was also the one in which I learned a lesson in values. My Aunt Juliette stopped at our house on her way from the afternoon classes. The visitors had not yet returned. Aunt Juliette was a large, handsome woman, beautifully dressed in the basic black of the day, a swishing taffeta, and a feathered hat. "T said to myself," the Aunt was saying, "that if Mrs. McCune could wear a patched dress I needn't be too proud to wear one, too." Then she chuckled, "It wasn't any better patched than if I had done it." COVERTLY I watched Mrs. McCune when she came home. She had worn the same dress most of the week, and I had seen no patch. I watched her raise her right arm. There was the patch, plain as day. Why did she wear the patched dress? Not because she had to wear it. Nor did she wear it to show the other women she was one of them.

There was not a particle of exhibitionism in her make-up. I decided she wore it because she liked the dress. It was a good, dark silk, easy to pack, and comfortable. Why shouldn't it be patched if it gave her a few months' more wear? It was not in her to be wasteful.
The final morning came. Again we were on the white porch; the air was fresh with the dew from the lawn and flowers. The visitors were wrapped in their gray wraps and dusters. I held the bag with the foreign labels. No one wanted to say goodbye.
Up drove the Stake President. Still we lingered.
It was Mrs. Gates who spoke for all of us. "You will always be dear to us," she said, facing us. "I want each of you when you see me in the years to come to speak to me and tell me you are an Ollerton from Parowan. I shall not forget."
They got into the car and went bumping up the street in a cloud of dust. Silently we watched the dust disappear. The house behind us seemed quiet and empty. Soon, but not today, we would say, "Do you remember when . . . ?"
Neither did the visitors forget us. The thank-you letters came first. One day the mail brought a package of books. For me, was John Stevens' Courtship, autographed by the author.
Mrs. McCune I never saw again, though my parents did several times. But Mrs. Gates I saw often. The first time was in a Salt Lake City restaurant. I was undecided about speaking. I had grown taller now and feared she might not remember me. Just then she looked up from her table and stood up, saying, "You are one of the Ollerton girls!"
ROADS
Grace M. Candland
The road of yesterday is closed for me; Time's stern decree has barred and locked the gate. I must move on, but can it be too late To look far down that beaten track and see Where I have failed, just how I lost my chance To step on higher ground where pine trees grow And why I trailed the sagebrush down below And scorned an invitation to advance?
Today, I'll route my path upon a grade That lifts and winds along the mountain side Where I can see new heights both far and wide And estimate the progress I have made.
I hold my destiny within my hands And life will give me what my heart demands.
MORMONISM IN THE EYES OF THE PRESS
James R. Clark, Brigham Young University Copyright 1948 IV Mormon Reaction to Criticism in the Press (Fourth and last installment of a series of articles dealing with early Latter-day Saint history)
ALTHOUGH the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally organized on April 6, 1830, the inaugural of the establishment of the Church was the first vision of Joseph Smith in the spring of the year 1820. In the story of that vision, published and republished in Mormon and non-Mormon literature since that time, the Prophet Joseph Smith says that he saw two personages:
. . . whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake to me, calling me by name, and said—pointing to the other—This is my Beloved Son, hear him.
Joseph Smith relates that after having had this vision he informed his neighbors, associates, and the ministers of various churches in his vicinity of his experience, and that he immediately encountered opposition and persecution.
The very first reaction of the Smith family to the press that has come to my attention is a paid advertisement which Joseph Smith Sr., father of the Prophet, inserted in the local "home-town" newspaper in Palmyra, New York. The advertisement ran for three consecutive issues, beginning September 25, 1824.
This was not the usual run-of-the-mill type of advertisement of land or livestock for sale. The advertisement was inserted by the senior Smith in an attempt to allay some of the opposition and persecution which had been engendered by his son's bold claims, and which had taken the form of malicious rumor to the effect that the body of Alvin Smith, brother of the Prophet, had been disturbed from its resting place and dissected. Father Smith says of his purpose in printing a denial of the rumors in the Wayne Sentinel:
This method is taken for the purpose of satisfying the minds of those who have heard the report, and of informing those who have put it in circulation, that it is earnestly requested they would desist therefrom; and that it is believed by some that they have been stimulated more by a desire to injure the reputation of certain persons than a philanthropy for the peace and welfare of myself and friends. (Signed) Joseph Smith.
Unless some new sources later come to light to prove otherwise, we may consider it highly probable that Joseph Smith Sr. was the first of the future Latter-day Saints to grasp what the newspaper could mean in the redress of their wrongs. It is perhaps also significant that this initial use of the newspaper came not in the form of a letter or article to a friendly editor, but in the form of a paid advertisement. The above attempt to allay prejudice and persecution may also be considered to be the inauguration of a policy that the Latter-day Saints followed throughout the period from 1824 to 1850, namely, that of the use of the public press, whenever accessible, as an agency for public hearing and redress.
Throughout his history of the Church which the Prophet Joseph Smith dictated to his clerks, he repeatedly refers to the influence of the press in relations between the Latter-day Saints and the American public. In the spring of 1831, only one year after the organization of the Church, he says:
At this age of the Church many false reports, lies, and foolish stories, were published in the newspapers and circulated in every direction, to prevent people from investigating the work, or embracing the faith. A great earthquake in China, which destroyed from one to two thousand inhabitants was burlesqued in some papers as "Mormonism in China."
LESS than two years after the Church was organized, a Mormon periodical was established at Independence, Missouri, with W. W. Phelps as editor. The first issue of The Evening and the Morning Star reached Joseph Smith in Kirtland, Ohio, in July 1832. In commenting on this first issue of the first Latter-day Saint periodical, Joseph Smith said:
Delightful indeed, was it to contemplate that the little band of brethren had become so large, and grown so strong, in so short a time as to be able to issue a paper of their own, which contained not only some of the revelations, but other information also, which would gratify and enlighten the humble inquirer after truth.

So embittered was the public mind against the truth that the press universally had been arrayed against us; and although many newspapers published the prospectus of our paper, yet appeared to have done so more to calumniate the editor, than give publicity to the forthcoming periodical. Editor thought to do us harm, while the Saints rejoiced that they could do nothing against the truth but for it.

In January 1833, Joseph Smith wrote to W. W. Phelps expressing dissatisfaction with the manner in which The Evening and the Morning Star was being conducted. He said:

"We wish you to render the Star as interesting as possible, by setting forth the progress, and faith of the Church, as well as the doctrine; for if you do not render it more interesting than at present, it will fall, and the Church suffer a great loss thereby."

As controversies arose in Missouri between the Saints and their neighbors, reports of the difficulties began to appear in the newspapers, and both groups used the Missouri papers to present their case to the public.

In a letter written from Kirtland, Ohio, to Edward Partridge in Liberty, Clay County, Missouri, Joseph Smith referred to a communication of Orson Hyde on the Missouri difficulties as published in the Missouri Republican. He said it was at variance with the reports he had received through private letters. (D.H.C. 1:448). The interesting thing about this communication to Edward Partridge is the fact that Joseph Smith seems to have given at least some credence to the reports in the Missouri Republican, even though he was generally skeptical of most newspaper reports. He instructed Edward Partridge to gather the correct information and send it immediately to Kirtland, Ohio, so that he could in turn "give the public correct information on the subject."

That as early as 1833 Joseph Smith did not overlook the possibility of using a political as well as a religious newspaper to present the Church point of view is evidenced by another statement from this same letter to Edward Partridge. He said: "We expect shortly to publish a political paper, weekly, in favor of the present administration; the influential men of that party have offered a liberal patronage to us, and we hope to succeed, for thereby we can show the public the purity of our intention in supporting the government under which we live." The party referred to was the Democratic Party under the leadership of Andrew Jackson.

Enough has been given from the writings of Joseph Smith to indicate his attitude toward newspapers as an instrument in presenting the Church viewpoint and to indicate that he was conscious of the fact that the press exerted influence in shaping public opinion. The Latter-day Saint Church issue was only one of many controversial issues occupying the press during the thirties and forties of the past century, and the Saints were not the only group being criticized. But editors seemed to exercise unusual editorial prerogative in their handling of the news of the Church, especially in not printing articles which Joseph Smith and other leaders sought to have published.

Although it is quite certain that the Latter-day Saints were not the only group thus unjustly dealt with by the newspapers, it was undoubtedly this adverse treatment in the public press which called forth from Parley P. Pratt an answer, in book form, which has been one of the most widely printed and circulated pieces of Church literature.

In his preface to the first edition of A Voice of Warning and Instruction to All People, published in New York in 1837, Parley P. Pratt said:

"During the last seven years, the public mind has been constantly agitated, more or less, through all parts of the country, with the cry of Mormonism, Mormonism, Delusion, Imposture, Fanaticism, etc.; chiefly through the instrumentality of the press. Many of the newspapers of the day have been constantly teeming with misrepresentations and lying slanders, of the foulest kind, in order to destroy the influence and character of an innocent Society, in its very infancy; a Society of whose real principles many of them know nothing at all.

"Every species of wickedness has been resorted to, and all manner of evil has been spoken against them, without the possibility of being heard for a moment, saying we do not wish to hear you, we know enough of your principles already. The newspapers, or our good preachers, have told us about you.

"Under these circumstances, what could be done? How were we to correct the public mind? We were few in number, and our means of giving information very limited; the columns of most of the papers were closed against us, their prosperity being at stake the moment our principles were admitted. It is true we published a monthly paper, in which our principles were clearly set forth; but its circulation was limited to a few thousands.

"Having said so much to impress upon the human mind the necessity of hearing and then judging, I would only add that the object of this publication is to give the public correct information concerning a religious system which has penetrated every state from Maine to Missouri as well as the Canadas, in the short space of seven years; organizing churches and conferences in every region, and gathering in its progress from fifty to an hundred thousand disciples. Having at the same time to sustain the shock of an overwhelming religious influence opposed to it by the combined powers of every sect in America.

"What but the arm of Omnipotence could have moved it forward amid the rage of mobs? Having to contend with the prejudice of the ignorant and the pen of the learned; at war with every creed and craft in Christendom, while the combined powers of earth and hell were hurling a storm of persecution, unparalleled in the history of our country."

His quotation states the general attitude of the majority of Church leaders toward the press of the period. The following reaction of a Latter-day Saint, as recorded in his diary, is typical of a number of comments from diaries of Church members who were not General Authorities.

Jesse Wentworth Crosby, born November 25, 1820, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia of British parentage, emigrated to Chautauqua County, New York with his parents in 1822. In 1838 he was baptized into the Church in Chautauqua County. In an entry in his diary for April, 1839, he said:

"The time passed... It was now April, and all things being ready we set about for Missouri— one thousand miles distant (1000) traveling by land with horse teams and lodging in our wagons; but before leaving our neighbors called often and _remonstrated with us for taking, as they thought, such a random journey. One said, 'Have you read the news: Why the Missourians and the Mormons are at war, they are killing and destroying, and will you persist in going, and running into danger and death?' We replied, 'We have warned you by words, now we warm you by light.'"

If danger or death gets in our way, we intend by the help of God to face the same like men of God, and show all men by example that we have embraced no fiction but an eternal reality, and when the secrets of all hearts are revealed, then, if not till then, you shall know that we are not deceived." This excerpt shows that Crosby, learning through the press that the RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�MARCH 1948 Church he had joined one year previously was having serious difficulties in Missouri, still manifests a determination to "gather to Zion" and, if "necessary, give up his life in the cause. The statement also indicates that Crosby's neighbors accepted the newspaper accounts and sought to dissuade him from going into an area where he was certain to meet opposition and persecution. It is also evident from Crosby's reply that he or his family had attempted to proselyte their neighbors and had failed, but that they were still speaking to each other despite the rumors afloat in the press. Certainly, a neighbor who comes on the eve of departure to attempt to dissuade one from a course of action which he feels is "a random journey," and one fraught with "danger and death," is acting the part of a friend.

Why did Crosby and his neighbors seemingly remain on friendly terms despite the unfavorable newspaper comments? Why did they fail to follow the usual reaction to bitter criticism and rumor?

An explanation of the continued friendliness of Crosby's neighbors, despite the adverse criticism of the Church in the press, may lie in Crosby's seventeen years residence in the community. I have found numerous other examples which seem _ to indicate that the saints withstood criticism in the press better in those areas where they had been resident for a considerable length of time, and when the uprightness of their characters had been manifest over the years.

Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? (Matt. 7:6).

Sentiment and Sanitation

Grace A. Woodbury

MARCH conference, in the town where I was reared, was, by the ambitious and thorough housewives of the town, preceded by house cleaning. Room by room, from attic to cellar, sorting, sunning, and cleaning were carried on with a zeal almost catastrophic as far as the comfort of the family was concerned. Regardless of how uncomfortable and tiring it was for the older members of the family, it was a time of fun and excitement for the children. It meant bonfires made from the straw that came from under the carpets, dancing on the carpet spread out on the grass, and playing house in the tents made by quilts and blankets hung over the clothesline for sunning.

I recall that the smell of clean straw, freshly whitewashed walls, and bonfire smoke was as much a part of spring to me as were the fragrance of locust and plum blossoms, the croaking of the frogs in the swampy grass, and the meadow larks singing on the pole fence. Along with the happy memories, come those of the days when we cleaned the upstairs playrooms. I have a vivid picture of my mother coming up the stairs with an evaluating gleam in her eye, which meant that she was going to sort over our playthings. We, my two sisters and I, had some young aunts, who gave us many, so we thought, lovely things to play with, old fans, perfume bottles, candy boxes, outgrown dresses and hats; in fact, anything they did not want or need found its way into our playrooms.

Realizing, as we did, that these sorting days were an inevitable part of spring and fall house cleaning, it was always with justified fears of being plundered that we watched mother, from her low stool-throne render judgment as to what should be done with our possessions. "This," she would say of some limp lawn or dimity dress, "isn't fit for anything but dusting and cleaning cloths, and this," holding up a gingham dress or percale apron, "will make a pretty stripe in a carpet. These woolen skirts I will up and use the best part for quilt blocks; the rest I can use in a braided rug."

After our "dress-ups" had been sorted into various heaps on the floor, mother would turn her attention to our efforts at decorating our playhouse. After an appraising glance, she would say, "Hand me those crocheted woolen tidies from your doll bed and little chair—such rubbish—why anyone would want to waste time, eyesight, and yarn on them, is more than I can understand. They harbor moths and must be burned and so must these old hat feathers and artificial flowers. Sometimes we wept over the loss of our treasures, but mother cheered us up by saying, "Don't cry. A month from now you will have a new collection," and we always did.

Page 177

Years later when I had the responsibility of deciding what to save and utilize and what to burn or give to the junkman, I realized that my mother had a "price above rubies" because of her ability to keep from being moved under with bags and boxes of unused and unusable articles. If I have fallen short of living up to her training it is because, so she said, I didn't have a good old wood cook or heating stove handy where things could be burned as soon as they became useless.

With our grandmothers and mothers, who had to make their carpets, rugs, and quilts, the saving of every scrap of cloth and old clothing was a necessity. However, to use their own words, they liked to keep their carpet rags and quilt pieces worked up; then they did not become a burden.

That procedure is as good today as it was then, and even though we do not have to make rag carpets in order not to have bare floors, woven rag rugs still have a place in our homes. They can be made to fit in with any color scheme, they can be put in a washing machine and cleaned as readily as a cotton house dress or apron. Old petticoats, shirts, house coats and house dresses, aprons, and rayon articles make very satisfactory rugs. Better rugs are made of all kinds of material. Obviously, a rug made of wool and cotton will not wash as well or weave as evenly as an all-wool or all-cotton one. However, cotton goods and rayon underwear go well together.

IT is really surprising how many odds and ends, in addition to old clothing, the average housewife has collected in drawers and boxes, that far, but drawers and boxes

crocheted rugs. Those faded sofa pillow covers, old feather ticks, scarves, and table runners that you have used too long, faded cretonne drapes and old bedspreads, yes, those old car seat covers can be used, and bathrobes and even socks. I shall tell you more about them shortly.

Can't you just visualize a lot of those attractive rugs that cost so little, if, in your spare time, you do your own rug cutting and sewing? If, however, you do not have any spare time and do not care for rag rugs, give your material to the Relief Society or to Deseret Industries. Let us not get "snowed under" without a thaw in sight.
Now about the socks. During the war I found a large box full of worn-out ones that for some reason, long since forgotten, I had saved. Our four boys were all away from home, helping in various ways to win the war. Those dozens of old socks brought back many, shall we say poignant and lively memories. Since I couldn't bear to burn the socks, I decided to cut and sew them and make a rag rug. In one afternoon I started at the top of the sock and cut around and around it until it was one continuous length of a yard or more. It was gratifying to find how quickly enough socks to make a rug could be cut and sewed. Thanks to the yen that the two younger boys had for bright striped and patterned hosiery, the rug has some stripes that shine out like a good deed in a naughty world, and make a happy contrast with the more subdued browns, tans, grays, and blues of the older boys' more conservative preference in socks. Perhaps that is carrying sentiment too far, but I am proud and fond of this rug, and may as well admit that I am still saving socks, but only the ones made of wool, cotton, or a mixture of wool and cotton.
Perhaps mention should be made that silk and rayon stockings also make attractive rugs. I made one from my own and my two daughters' stockings in which the entire stocking except the heel and toe was used and the top hem was cut open. I braided the material in much the same method as is used in braiding a round basket. The rug, when finished, is to describe it dramatically, a symphony in tan.
There are moments in my life when I wonder, yes, even worry about that old proverb, "As a twig is bent, the tree is inclined." I know that as a "twig" I was bent in the right direction regarding the disposal of articles that should be remodeled into something useful, repaired, given away, or burned. Yet, as a "tree" I am inclined to keep things stored away that there's, if they did break in, would not care to steal, and in which moths find refuse.
Generally speaking, and I realize that I am rationalizing, most people do collect things—everything, in fact, from buttons to bric-a-brac. Then there are those who just let things collect. At house-cleaning time many of these last mentioned collections are given to the junkman, but often one does not have the moral fortitude to part with a collection of things, either because of sentimental value, or because one has hopes of doing something with them some day.
I know whereof I speak, for there is in my collection a case of empty, gallon, cracked, otherwise damaged cans that have been in the basement for five years in the expectation that some day I am going to cover them with some leftover drapery material and make them into a useful footstool. Since hope is supposed to spring eternal even in a collector's breast, I am justified in my future plans, because once there were three cases of cans in the basement and I did make three footstools from them, but this spring I am determined that the city dump shall no longer be deprived of their radiance. I have some newer ideas about covering and lining five-gallon roof paint cans to serve the dual purpose of a hassock and a place to keep one's shoes. My collection of things that collect also contains a sad flatiron, clamsy, heavy, and slow, but it brings back memories of many childhood-hours, where one of the children always gave this riddle about sad flatirons: "Three-cornered, square, black as a bear, tell me this riddle or I'll pull your hair."
Then, of course, I think of the dresses, aprons, and ruffled petticoats that were ironed with it. Not long ago someone told me that just such an old sad iron would make a dependable doorstop, and suggested some improvements designed to make it fit more artistically or usefully into its new role. I cannot remember just what it was that she mentioned. It might have been adorning it with a petunia or a hollyhock. But, with or without the decoration, I must make use of that iron.
Once I owned a collection of nicked, cracked, and otherwise damaged dishes, but that was before Bob L., a friend of our boys, came

"For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women OR ALL NATIONS"

FREEDOM OF SPEECH: How fiercely we pounce upon our best friends when their opinions are the opposites of our own! How little we tolerate liberty of thought in others, though claiming it so passionately for ourselves. T. Tilton

REQUIREMENTS FOR NURSES: The six qualifications for a good nurse are: Presence of mind, gentleness, accuracy, memory, observation, and forethought. The Children's Hospital, London

THE SABBATH DAY: The sabbath is to the rest of the week in spirituals what summer is to the rest of the year in temporals; it is the chief time for gathering knowledge to last you through the following week, just as summer is the chief season for gathering food to last you through the following twelve months. A. W. Hare

PASSING AWAY
Is it well to look back to the days that are gone,
Is it well to remember the sunshine and song?
Do they help us the better life's labors to bear,
Will they help us to win to that home over there?
I know not, but oft in the twilight's still hours,
There steals on my sense, like perfume of flowers,
Sweet dreams of the past, and they soothe me to rest
Like a message of love from the land of the blest.
Hope

MISS ALCOTT'S ADVICE: Girls, don't be in haste to wed. Build up healthy bodies by good food, plenty of exercise, and sleep. Learn all the useful household arts before you attempt to make a home. Cultivate your minds with the best books that you may be able to teach your children much that school training alone will never give them. Choose your amusements wisely, for youth must have pleasure, but need not waste itself in harmful frivolity. Above all, select your friends with care. Avoid girls who live only for fashion, flirtation, and enjoyment, and use the privilege all women may claim of declining the acquaintance of young men whose lives will not bear inspection by the innocent eyes of women. Let no delusion of wealth, rank, comeliness, or love tempt you to trust your happiness to such a one. Watch and wait till the true lover comes.

RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE IN BEAVER STAKE (UTAH): Sister Ruth Tyler said the sisters in her ward were trying to take care of the poor and perform all their duties. "The labor of caring for our families is great, but we must try to devote a portion of our time to the work of the Lord, and he will bless us with his Holy Spirit." Sister Hattie Fotheringham said: "We should try to overlook one another's faults and cherish a spirit of forgiveness toward all. We should try to improve our minds and bless those around us." Sister Mary Ashworth spoke of the responsibilities of mothers in raising their children and said it was our privilege to enjoy the spirit of the Lord in performing our duties. Sister Delia Cox said: "It is not the actions of others, but our own actions that will condemn or save and exalt us."

EMILY SMITH STEWART (Mrs. Robert Murray Stewart), daughter of President George Albert Smith, has recently been accorded much recognition. In December she represented Utah as State Director of Women's Activities for the National Infantile Paralysis Conference. Utah still has the best program in the nation for volunteer work in this disease, and in recognition of that fact, Mrs. Stewart traveled from Washington to Georgia with Lady Inverchapel, wife of the British Ambassador to the United States, and with Lady Balfour. Lady Inverchapel, a former poliomyelitis patient, has given a great amount of volunteer service to patients in America, and was particularly interested in Mrs. Stewart and the Utah program. Britain is trying to establish a program to combat the serious epidemic there. At Warm Springs, Mrs. Stewart conducted a panel discussion on volunteer service. She contributed to the American Hospital Magazine, by invitation, an article on volunteer polio service in Utah.

Mrs. Stewart has been invited to be a guest of honor and to attend a reception for such special guests at the conference of the National Association of Broadcasters and the National Association of Women Broadcasters, in January, in Washington, D.C.. Mrs. Stewart has also been invited to be the honored woman at the Mortar Board Woman's Day program at Iowa State College, March 4, where she will speak on the subject of college women's responsibilities to public welfare. She has been recognized with an appointment as National Chairman of the International Committee for the American Federation of Soroptimists Clubs.

THE oldest college in the United States to confer degrees on women is Wesleyan, at Macon, Georgia, which was chartered for that purpose in 1836. It was known at that time as Georgia Female College.

In its fifty years of existence, the Utah Education Association has had only three women presidents: Mrs. Emma McVicker, 1902-03; Miss Hazel Brockbank (now Mrs. Bowen of Spanish Fork), 1944-45; Miss Maud Hardman, present incumbent, supervisor of art in Salt Lake City schools. All have been very gracious as well as competent executives.

This year three of the eight trustees of the Association are women: Mrs. Clair L. Jackson, Salt Lake, president; Mrs. Marva Banks Lindsay, Murray; and Miss Mary McMillan, Cedar City.

SAYS I. A. R. WYLIE, an excellent woman author: "Women are more than half of the world's population. No war could be conducted more than two weeks without their co-operation."

EDITORIAL VOL 35 MARCH 1948
A Challenge to Our Generation

"If the time ever comes that women are organized for the sole purpose of human uplift, it will be a force for good such as this world has never known." Matthew Arnold

N March 17, 1842, the women of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were organized, by a prophet of God, for the sole purpose of human uplift, and for the past 105 years they have been a mighty force for good. During the year just past, the Centennial year of the Church in the West, we have had frequent occasion to look back over the accomplishments of our people during that one hundred years, and we have found their accomplishments great, and the women of the Church, no less than the men, have made great contributions of service for human uplift. The achievements of Relief Society women, both in public life and in the home, stand today as a monument to the power of their faith and service and as a challenge to our generation.

Today we stand with our faces both ways. We look backward with pride on the accomplishments of the past. We have walked the first mile. We also look forward with anticipation to the opportunity for accomplishment that is before us in the year 1948—the first step in the second mile. We are the generation that will travel the second mile and its accomplishments will be what we, as individuals, make them.

What Can We Relief Society Women Do Today to Wield That Great Force for Good? We Need Not Go Out and Look for New Fields of Conquest; We Need to Concern Ourselves in Giving of Our Talents to the Problems of Our Everyday Life. Never in the History of Our World Has There Been a Greater Need for Women to Strive for the Maintenance of the True Latter-day Saint Home. Let Us Get a Comprehensive Understanding of the Gospel and Make Sure It Is Being Taught and Practiced in Our Homes, Let Us Rediscover the Loyalty of Our Pioneer Mothers, Loyalty to the Gospel, to Authority, and to Our Families. Let Us Establish the Practice of Family Prayer. Let Us Keep the Sabbath Day Holy. Let Us Develop Faith, Love, Cheerfulness, and Peace in Our Homes and Within Ourselves. Then Will the Spirit of the Lord Dwell within Us and It Will Radiate from Us, thereby Magnifying Us and Making Us a Force for Good, in Our Homes and Communities.

Spring in Utah
Katherine Fernelius Larsen
Grate the raucous gulls swoop where the farmer tills,
And greening verdure stains dun Utah hills;
Red-budded, supple willows fringe the river
Where bluebirds flash bright plumage, and the quiver
Of sparkling sunlight prisms water's ripple;
The mountains rise to dazzling blue, with stipple
Of cloud wisps, white as snow still on their tips;
The meadow lark's clear carol rises, dips
Across the lowlands, and the uplands fling
Warm, pungent smell of sage to herald spring.

Pankapaw
Deone R. Sutherland
My husband, Harvey, after I graduating from _ college, signed a contract to teach school in Pankapaw.
"Where is Pankapaw?" I asked him, looking at the map.
I have never been able to find anything on a map.
"You can never find anything on a map," said Harvey, telling me that which I knew already.
"Pankapaw is a very important town in the southern part of this State. Pankapaw has fifteen hundred people and a very large high school. We shall be an asset to the community and I will learn a great deal about teaching school."
"Undoubtedly," I said, feeling convinced.
Harvey can sound very convincing.
My brother-in-law loaded his car.
"We cannot get anything more in the car or outside of the car," said my brother-in-law.

That is very true, I thought, looking at the bed strapped to the top of the car, the toaster on the fender, the quilts and canned tomato juice in the trunk, my hats squashed against the back window. I went back into my mother's house and conferred with Harvey. My sister said she and her husband would also drive a car down. "Two cars," I exclaimed brightly, "we shall go in style to Pankapaw, like a caravan, like gypsies!" Harvey does not like me to get ecstatic. He looked sourly at the flapping, crammed cars. "If the engine doesn't boil over into the things there some way. Toaster before we get there—or the bed slide off—or—" My mother handed us a lunch and said that, much as she hated to see us go, we had better go. "Do the cars look too disgraceful?" I whispered to my mother. "I do not want Pankapaw to get a bad impression of us, as if we were sheepherders or gypsies or something." I am a school teacher's wife now and must at all costs appear normal, I reminded myself. My mother frowned at the cars. "Well, no," she replied hesitantly. "After all, you have to get your things there some way. Toaster before we get there—or the bed slide off—or—" My mother reminisced fondly. "Your Uncle Alonza used to pack for touring the country. He was a crazy one." She is at times very consoling. "Your Uncle Alonza was crazy if a man ever was," my father used to say, pursing his lips at mother and shaking his head. "Your mother's family—' he would begin hopelessly to us, shrugging his shoulders and then, looking very doleful, he would read the paper again. "The things I could tell you about your father's family—' my mother would always retort. But my father would refuse to be roused from his paper so that we never heard the things my mother could have told us about papa's family if she had only cared to. "I shall trace our route on the map," I said happily. I get very excited when we go on a trip. Even while holding a box of bath towels PANKAPAW and a waffle iron I can be excited about traveling. "You are going the wrong way on the map," said Harvey to me. "We are going the opposite direction." The towns were too far in between, and I could not find the correct highway numbers, so I gave the map to Harvey. It discouraged me also to discover that I began getting thirsty in the exact center of the distance between two towns. I thought it could be psychological, so I quit looking at the map. There were other things to look at anyway. "Look at all the sagebrush," I said to Harvey. "It will be any time now," said Harvey. "Any time now we should be in Pankapaw." We had been traveling all afternoon, and the sun was sinking out beyond the gray sage and purple mountains. We began to look for Pankapaw. We found Pankapaw. We stopped the car. "Is this Pankapaw?" called my brother-in-law to a man walking along the street. He said it was. We were here, I guessed. "Now where?" We went to the home of the superintendent of schools. He was to take us to our apartment. "He is out seeing to his milch cows, but we expect him home any time now," said his wife. Our two cars with the bed on top pulled up and parked in front of the superintendent's house. Harvey walked up the street. We didn't look at the cars. The superintendent's wife stared at the cars, and then her three children came out and stared. We waited. They had an apartment for us. We carried in the things. It was a very small apartment. The bed, when put up, filled the bedroom. We stood out in the hall and talked after we had unloaded the cars. "Won't you stay to dinner?" I said to everyone. Harvey looked at me. The others answered too quickly. They had to get started back; it was very late; they were very tired; they had to get started on the long trip back. "Well, here we are," I said profoundly and cheerfully to Harvey. Harvey was asleep on the bed, surrounded by boxes. I looked out the window. It was dark already. We had been driving all afternoon and were tired. Pankapaw, I murmured, Pankapaw. The night was dark at the window. There was no answer from Pankapaw. T dawn, from a great distance, I heard Harvey's alarm clock. I turned over. Harvey was sitting up in bed looking at a sheet of paper. "What is it, Harvey?" I asked. It was just beginning to get light at the window. It was dawn in Pankapaw, cold dawn, and I was tired. "I am reading my instructions for today," answered Harvey. "We, all the teachers, are to go on a field trip. We are to look at various grazing areas." He folded his paper and crawled out of bed. "Right now?" I yelled. He turned around. "Unpack while I am gone." The bed was cold and lonely. I stepped over the boxes and went out into the kitchen. I could hear Harvey gargling in the bathroom. Well, anyway, he won't expect any breakfast with this mess about, I thought. I sat on Harvey's old college alligator bag, which was piled on top of the only kitchen chair that I could see. "Where's breakfast?" demanded 188 Harvey, poking his soapy head out of the bathroom. I decided that there would be no point in suggesting that we eat out. I got down off the alligator bag. Well, I have plenty of things I can do while he is gone today, I thought. The apartment was very quiet. Perhaps I should look first at the town a bit. I stepped over a box of dishes and the juicer toward the door. It would probably cheer me up to step outside where I could no longer see this—this—I gestured vaguely at the mounds filling our miniature living room. I came back in half an hour. The town is very pretty, I thought. I liked trees and country roads and there was a courthouse clock that struck the hour. There was now nothing left but to unpack. At five o'clock in the afternoon I went down and sat on the front porch to wait for Harvey. Everything was ready for Harvey. He did not come. The wind rustled the autumn leaves, and Pankapaw was a long way from home, and I had seen the whole town in half an hour. I began to feel uncomfortable. At half past five I went upstairs and thought about packing up again. After all, we really didn't know too much about Pankapaw. I turned the heat under the food off and then on again. Perhaps Harvey would not mind if I went home briefly, to visit my parents, I said to myself, while picking out the burned parts of the potatoes and throwing them in the garbage.

I sat down by the living room clock. I began not to like Harvey a great deal. At six o'clock I turned all the burners on the stove off and went down and sat on the front porch again. I could RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�MARCH 1948 see the Pankapaw High School across the field. It looked deserted and lonely. A lone leaf hurtled across the lawn, orange in the setting sun. "Harvey," I moaned. A truck stopped in front and let Harvey out. Somebody hollered, "We didn't keep him too long, Mrs. Thompson, did we?" And then, "Ha! Hal hal" floated out. From the inside of the truck. Ha, ha, I thought bitterly. "No, no," I called out. Harvey came up the walk. "Where have you been?" I said to Harvey. "Looking at sagebrush," Harvey said. We went up the stairs. "All day, just looking at sagebrush. Some of it's fenced in and some of it isn't�" I quit listening to him. Something was smoking in the kitchen. I must have missed a burner. Harvey washed and then he ate and then he lay down on the couch and closed his eyes. "Harvey," I said. "Harvey, I unpacked." "Yeah," said Harvey, and he turned over on his side facing the wall. "What good does it do to look at sagebrush, Harvey?" I asked. "Harvey!" "It's all very scientific," said Harvey, still with his back to me. He sounded very tired. "There's a very scientific purpose to the whole thing �I'll tell you about it tomorrow� glub, glub," said Harvey. I went into the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bathtub. I felt very bad. I rested my forehead on the cold water faucet and thought about streetcars and trolley cars and taxis and busses and the lovely dinners we had at home. �Glub,� I choked against the faucet. PANKAPAW Harvey came in and sat by me on the bathtub. He put his arm around me, which made me feel worse. "Glub glub," I moaned into the bathtub. "Do not feel bad," said Harvey. "I will tell you all about the grazing O's of outside of Pankapaw. I will tell you all this scientific stuff, Nitwit." Harvey can be very kind and affectionate when he wishes to be.

FOR four days at the crack of dawn Harvey's alarm would ring and I would wake up to find Harvey sitting up in bed reading his typewritten instructions for the day. It is very lonely being the wife of a schoolteacher, I thought. Especially since school has not yet even begun.

And then school did begin. I sat on the side of the bathtub watching Harvey tie his tie before the only mirror in our apartment. "Are you nervous?" I said to him. He did not answer. He jerked at his tie. "Do not worry," I said. "Anyway, more than likely none of the students will be larger than you." Harvey is quite tall, but still he did not look consoled. Sometimes it is very hard to be a helpmeet kind of wife. "And you do know a great deal about various things�"

Harvey patted me on the shoulder, reached for his books, and ran down the stairs. Harvey was a schoolteacher. I ate Harvey's cold toast that he had left and thought about being a school teacher's wife. At eleven o'clock Harvey came running home.

"The boys have locked some girls in a closet, and we can't get them out." He grabbed some keys. "Goodbye," he called, running down the stairs, his tie flying out behind.

I thought about being a schoolteacher.

Harvey was very busy. He had to sponsor the school paper, put on the school play, and help sponsor a class. He was also supposed to teach six classes. "So many�" I said. But Harvey was too busy studying to answer me. I went to the library for another armload of books for me to read. I admired the oleander plant in the library, selected my books, lingered, looking at the first stars coming out, and then went up to the tiny apartment, and found Harvey still studying. Sometimes, I thought, life can be very dull.

We began taking the newspaper from home so that we would not be so homesick. The News came down to Pankapaw on the bus and then had to be delivered after that. We would doze off while waiting for the paper to come. It seemed better to stay awake at night and read it then than to get it in the morning and read it a day late. Once in a while we would take turns staying awake for it. But it usually took both Harvey and me to find it. We had no flashlight, so we would go down where it was time and strike matches. We would search first the length of the porch. One night we found it easily�on the edge of the porch, but usually it was off somewhere among the leaves on the big dark stretch of lawn or in the weeds near the ditch. We would strike matches and hunt for it. We always felt very triumphant when we would finally find it.

It was while hunting for the paper one night that Harvey told me about the party. "We are going on a party," said Harvey. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE 1948 "With the senior class," said Harvey, "up the canyon." Then we found the paper.

The next night he came in. "We have to leave for Pankapaw Canyon in five minutes," he said. "Get ready." I looked at the dinner-none of which had turned out badly�and began to hunt for my sweaters and old riding breeches. I was pulling on my pants when the truckload of seniors began to honk and shout down below our window from the street.

"Come on," yelled Harvey.
I ran down the stairs and tried to look dignified while running for the truck. Harvey boosted me on and the students pulled. We were going in a cement truck that belonged to the father of one of the students. Fine cement floated in the air. I coughed and hung onto Harvey.

"The wind is certainly strong," I said to one of the girls and nearly fell out of the truck. The truck had turned a corner.

"Nearly lost you that time," said the girl.
"You certainly did," I said.
"Stay in the truck," said Harvey.
"I certainly will," I said and hung onto Harvey, seniors, and, now and then, the side of the truck.

Pankapaw Canyon had turned orange-brown for fall. It was nearly October. I had forgotten that we had been in Pankapaw a month.

"We've been here a month," I shouted to Harvey.
"What?" he yelled, squinting in the wind.
"Beautiful canyon," I said.
"What?" he yelled, turning so that his hair blew across his eyes.
"Look, pine trees," I shouted. And the truck stopped and we got out
and brushed the dust and cement from us. My knees hurt and I walked toward the hemlock under the pines and aspens to rest.

HARVEY shouted for me to come back, that we were going on a treasure hunt.

We chose up sides and that was the last I saw of my side. I found the history teacher caught in a thicket on the side of a mountain and helped her get loose. When we got back to the camp, everyone was eating and putting Harvey on the back. His side had won. I sat down by the fire and watched the red bumps rise on my legs from the stinging nettle. Harvey brought me some food.
"Not one clue," I said to Harvey, "not one clue did I get a chance to see. I never saw anybody after that first wild shout and scramble except Miss Horne here." I looked at Miss Horne. She looked very pale.
Miss Horne smiled at me. "We do this several times a year," she said.
Harvey pushed my hot dog at me, and after that I felt fine when the throng came pale yellow and round through the trees, when the sound of the creek bubbled from off in the dark somewhere, and then the students, sitting on logs around the fire, began to sing. They sang the Pankapaw High School song and Harvey held my hand.
"Everything is lovely," I said to Harvey. "Perfectly lovely," I said looking carefully, listening to the students' sing. And then they gave three cheers for Harvey, and I wanted to stand up and cheer for Harvey, too, but he said to wait until I got home and he pulled me down.
"Hurrah," I said, anyway, very softly. "Hurrah for Pankapaw." 
PANKAPAW knew I was being carried away and was being slightly sentimental, but I couldn't help it. I did not even mind the cold windy gale of the ride home back down the canyon. "Hurrah," I gasped, swaying on the truck, losing my breath in the wind. "Hurrah!" It was our anniversary, I decided the next day. One month in Pankapaw. I bought candles and kept stirring everything on burners turned down as low as they would go. Nothing can happen tonight, I said. I went out looking for something to fill our one vase. Harvey came in and sat down. He did not notice the candles. He did not come out into the kitchen to see what we were going to eat. He did not say anything about it being one month. He took out a check and gave it to me. "There were a lot of deductions," he said. T looked at the check and the deductions. "Surely are," I said. "They have deducted the money we were going to pay for the rent." I looked at my budget. "Of course, some of it you get back in the end," said Harvey. "Yes," I said, looking at my budget. It was not the rent money they could deduct. Maybe it would have to be the food money, or something. 194 "Mother can send us canned stuff," I said. "I'm best at opening cans." I patted the sage decorating our one vase. It was gray-green and looked rather nice in a yellow vase, I thought. From the kitchen window we watched the moon rise. "Pankapaw has nice moons, anyway," said Harvey. I agreed. He reached across the table and held my hand. "Real nice," said Harvey. Someone knocked on the door. It was a student. "Mr. Thompson, some of the kids are over to the school waiting to rehearse—thought we'd better—" "Oh, yes," said Harvey. "Tl be right over." He hurried into the bedroom and began putting on his coat. I went over to the typewriter and began to type. I wrote, "My husband, Harvey, after graduating from college—" Harvey leaned over my shoulder. "What are you writing?" "It's a story," I said, "about us." "Ts nothing sacred?" asked my husband, hurrying out the door. I could hear Harvey and the student running down the steps, banging out the hall. I laughed and wrote: "signed a contract to teach school in Pankapaw—" 
PARTING Adeline R. Ensign
There always comes a parting time When we must say goodbye, When sadness fills the lonely hearts And teardrops dim the eye.
For time is ever passing on, Nor would we change the plan, For when God gave us life he knew That tears were good for man.
And so, as sorrows come along, Oh, give us strength, we pray, And give us faith and courage, Lord, Sufficient for each day.

CHAPTER 2
Synopsis: Anne Raines, influenced by her sister Della, has persuaded her husband Joe to agree to sell their ranch home. Joe, planning to look for work in the city, leaves the ranch, and Anne, worried over the responsibility of looking after the place, feels a premonition of trouble ahead.
IT was noon of the next day and Anne stood in the doorway holding a telegram in her hand. The words seemed to melt and fuse together ". . . Joe seriously injured in automobile accident . . . in hospital . . . will write . . . Della."
A flood of tragic experiences crowded the next few days. Joe's condition continued doubtful.

Della rushed back in her car and took Anne and the children to the city, where Anne hovered over her unconscious husband for hours before he even knew her. Then, there were many more hours of anxiety before Joe's condition was considered fairly safe. Even then, he would have to spend months in the hospital.
All this Anne had to face, then choose her course. There was no time for regrets or self-sympathy, and there was no time to think about the future. The present required every waking moment.
Back on the homestead, she went to work, not only milking the cows, caring for the horses, and caring for her garden. With a fierce and sudden pride, she determined to show Joe she could really take care of things. She hardly noticed the passing of time, except to get the brief messages telling of his condition.
Page 194
Anne was trying to summarize these rapid events and reduce them to some sort of ordered control as she picked the first green peas from the garden. She was canning them—piles of them; and the corn was coming on promisingly, too. Food, for which she had never lacked in her life, suddenly became a matter of great importance. Millions in the world were starving; besides, with Joe unlikely to work for many months, she forgot about her dream home in town, and began planning where they could remain on the farm during the winter while his broken bones continued to mend, if they had plenty of food stored away, and the cows to give them milk.
Even Dick and Betsy were becoming useful under her careful guidance.
"Momie, I got this row of carrots weeded," cried Dick from the bottom of the garden.
"Thanks, Darling, now you can rest awhile."
"But I don't want to rest. I want to help raise food for the hungry people."
Though she recognized in these words an immediate fulfillment of her own teaching, she was struck with their childish sincerity. Mopping the perspiration from her face, she struggled with a choking feeling in her throat, and a swift vision of little Dickie going off to war some day tortured her.
"What did you say, Momie?" "Nothing, Darling, but you can weed a little more if you want to."
At that moment, Betsy came down from the house with jam from her breakfast still on her cheeks. "Momie, I will pick some weeds," she volunteered, her round face serious, and her blue eyes sparkling.
"Thanks, Honey. I'm afraid you'll pick the wrong weeds. How would you like to help mother gather peas?"
"Fine!" Betsy lost no time getting busy.
A little later, she heard Dick talking angrily, and throwing stones as hard as he could, whereupon she discovered he was after a squirrel he had caught invading the garden.
"Momie, come here," he finally called urgently. "The squirrels are eating our cabbages and cauliflowers. Oh, look, they've ruined them!"
ANNE hurried to the bottom of the garden. A sudden instinctive dread clutched at her heart. So the squirrels were beginning to get bad. She looked back at the wheat, now springing green on the sidehill, after which she inspected the havoc wrought among her cabbages, and began to experience a tragic fear such as she imagined people felt in the presence of an invading army. She met the fiery gaze in her son's eyes, and a shadow crept into her own.
"We'll have to fight them, that's all. Get some traps from the granary. I wonder if they've started to bother the wheat. We'll have to set out some poison." Anne took off her straw hat and fanned her warm face, then straightened her shoulders. She had a little war all of her own.
A car came up the road, holding her somewhat spellbound in an effort to see who was arriving. But she failed to recognize the driver until the car stopped in the yard a few feet from her. Then, a tall angular man, with a weatherbeaten face and a hooked nose, got out and came toward her. She recognized Sam Hadfield.
"Howdy, Mrs. Raines," he greeted stiffly. "Seems as if you're havin' a pretty tough time of it this summer."
"Oh, yes, but I can manage all right," she replied weakly. She had never liked Hadfield, and now, his sudden appearance seemed to be an ill omen. "I—I find the squirrels are bothering my garden a little."
"Well, Mrs. Raines, there's no use of a city woman like you monkeying with a garden, or anything else out in this wilderness. Nothin'll grow in these hills, anyway, except a little bunch grass and enough cattle and sheep to eat it up." He came uncomfortably close; his small, deep-set eyes searched hers.
Anne experienced a feeling of helplessness. "I can manage," she declared.
Hadfield lingered, wavering between embarrassment and an unspoken purpose. Finally he spoke—gruffly. "I think you'd better pack up and go to the city, where you can take care of Joe. I can take everything over now. I made Joe promise to stay till fall. But now, he's hurt. I want to help all I can."
"I—I couldn't leave now," Anne stammered, realizing for the first time the stark reality of letting someone else take possession. A scowl flitted across Hadfield's face. "Maybe, Joe didn't tell you everything. You see I've bought the place. I argued Joe into stayin' awhile." He grinned impressive and would have taken hold of her arm had she not moved. "Of course, I ain't puttin' you off—not yet," he assured in a tone suggesting irritation and a mild threat. "I thought you'd be anxious to go."
"We are staying," Anne replied artlessly. Her tone seemed to convey the impression she failed to get the full impact of his meaning, rather than that she was defying him, yet the effect was equally conclusive.
"Er, er, well, I'll be going," he said lamely. "But I'll see you later. How's Joe getting along the last you heard?" "Very well, thanks. But his legs are both broken, so it'll be a long while before he'll be able to do anything." Still, Hadfield was loath to go. He lingered, trying to flatter her with rude compliments and veiled hints concerning the uselessness of her efforts. When he did finally leave, the sun seemed scorching hot, though it was only half way to noon, and the moisture on her face evaporated, leaving her cheeks dry and hot, as she stared at his car until it reached the county road. Dick called her as he came down from the granary with some traps, and little Betsy sidled up to her.
"What's the matter, Momie?" she inquired seeing tears in her mother's eyes. Anne seemed to find no words to answer. A hawk sailed through the clear blue, casting its racing shadow along the edge of the yard, and suddenly reminding her of danger to her small chickens and hens.
"Dick! Betsy!" she suddenly urged. "Let's chase that hawk away. It might kill some of our chickens." She ran up the path, with the children following.

Then, with determined efficiency, she crowded the chicks, which their frightened mothers had already gathered to the best of her ability, in their pens, where she knew they would be safe. Then, suddenly giving way to her feelings, she took the children in her arms and opened the floodgate of her tears. Vaguely, she sensed an approaching crisis with Hadfield, who seemed to believe he had a title to the farm, and suddenly, she realized she had no desire to sell the homestead ever! Della wrote at the end of the week, demanding that Anne prepare to come home at once. "Get somebody—anybody—to look after the crop. That forsaken place is not for a woman to run single-handed," wrote her practical, sympathetic sister. In a way, Anne was hungry to accept the invitation. She wanted so much to be near Joe. She made several attempts to answer the letter, but she tore them up, in the end merely writing a brief note, signifying her determination to stay and take care of the farm. This course seemed right, and that was all that mattered.

Joe was still unable to write, but he sent word to let Hadfield take over. "I can't let you stay there any longer, Honey," he wrote.
But Anne wrote back: "Don't worry about me, Darling. Your job is to get better. I'm doing wonderfully well. You see I can say that since there's no one else here to say it for me. I'm actually learning to like it, and both Dickie and Betsy are becoming real farmers."

She smiled when she mailed the letter, and was still thinking about it that evening as she went up to the hilltop to let the breeze cool her cheeks, while she watched the sun set at the close of what seemed an endless day. It seemed as if Joe was beside her; she could hear his voice as if he had sounded the evening she had seen him give up his last effort to cling to the homestead.

Had she been right? Yes, she reflected. We simply can't spend our lives here, entirely. Yet, as she looked out into the fathomless gloaming, she knew now she loved every inch of the rough acres they had toiled to subdue, and the thought of turning them over to an unsympathetic stranger was equally heartbreaking. Why do decisions have to be so far-reaching? Why can't life offer more compromises? she cried in anguish.

A mourning dove cooed in a distant hollow; she turned and walked down the dusty trail toward the house.
Della finally drove out to the farm. She was amazed to find her sister milking the cows, and little Dick tugging at the pump handle to get some water for the horses. Even Betsy was doing her bit by carrying some of the water to the chickens in a small bucket. Della was even more amazed when she saw Anne turn the cream separator, feed the calves and the pigs, and the horses. She scolded her, and made some real attempts to help, but in neither case was she very successful. She concluded somewhat helplessly that the most surprising thing was Anne's sturdy independence. She seemed to mind the farm less with its backbreaking cares than she had previously done with Joe at home to carry the heaviest part of the work.

But Della was good at argument. "You can't stay here another day. I'm going to take you home with me," she insisted.
"I'm going to stay all summer, and as much longer as necessary to take care of the crops," retorted Anne.
"Listen here, Girlie, what do you think you are, a regiment of infantry? The hay will have to be cut. Can you cut it? No. The cattle will have to be kept out of the grain. Can you do it? Of course not. And please don't tell me you're going to do the heading and threshing." Della ended her recital of difficulties with a devastating truth.
"Well, anyway, let's go up to the house and get some supper," replied Anne mildly, as she completed her chores. "I think I can still cook."

She felt incapable of winning an argument with her strong-willed sister; but something inside her—something very stubborn and defiant—gave her a feeling of triumph she couldn't express. She had come to think of the farm as a trust left with her. She had grown, also, to feel proud of her gardening, and her shining. She had to admit some of the large responsibilities were still in the future, consequently she still had them to meet. "You'd be surprised what I can do," she finally said, teasingly, as they entered the house. "Surprised! Maybe you think I'm not already. But enough's enough. You're quitting."

"Aunt" Delia," cried Dick, rushing into the house after a mysterious excursion through the garden and up along the edge of the wheat, "I'm trapping. I'm cleaning the squirrels out."
"Ugh," Della gasped. "Surely, you're not letting him—"
"Oh, yes, Dickie's a man now."

In the end Della returned to the city, declaring that she was no longer equal to the task of looking after Anne and the children. Meanwhile, the summer days grew hotter, and the wheat struggled for growth on the hillside, while the lucerne came into bloom in the small field below the ditch. The squirrels began to nibble at the edges of the grain, which immediately responded by turning a sickening yellow; but Anne set out poison and destroyed them. And when the proper time came, she mowed and raked the hay; then hired it stacked. Promising to pay for it when the threshing was done.

"I'm learning to appreciate the beauty of living close to the good earth," she wrote to Della. "Yes, I'm learning to be a farmer." She was gloating over these achievements the morning Sam Hadfield again drove into the yard. "Well, Mrs. Raines, I see you're sticking it out better than I thought you could. But the worst part's coming. Cattle are driftin' in from the mountains now, and they'll be crowdin' the fences to get into your wheat. Why don't you let me look after it. I'll get it 'cut as soon as possible, then I can let my cattle come right in. I expect to use this place, you know, as a fall pasture."

It took a mighty effort on Anne's part to remain unruffled at this poorly disguised assumption of ownership, yet she steadied herself to meet the issue. "Have you actually bought this place from my husband, or did you merely make him an offer?" she inquired as casually as she was able.

Hadfield was taken back by this sally, but he was ready for it. "Why—er—I bought it. That is | paid him a payment on it to bind the bargain. He said he wanted some money to pay on a place in town."

Anne felt herself growing faint.

"Oh, I see." Joe hadn't said anything to her about a payment, and she had been under the impression they had merely come to some sort of verbal agreement which could not be considered binding. "May—may I ask the price agreed on?" Hadfield, still sitting in his can, tried to dodge the question, but she wouldn't let him. "I'm paying him ten dollars an acre," he blurted. "Why, that's robbery! It's worth three times that much. I won't agree. I'll fight it." Anne was trembling from head to foot, but never in her life before had she been so determined. "I'm going at once to see Joe about this. We're not going to sell—at all." "You've already sold," Hadfield half snarled, driving away. (To be concluded) 

Sentiment and Sanitation (Continued from page 179)

To dinner. These dishes were my particular trial because, no matter how far I put them back in the cupboard, they managed to escape occasionally and would show up on the table at the most inopportune times. Yet, regardless of my resolution to send chipped plates and cracked cups to the ash can, as soon as the damage occurred, I kept them around. Do not ask me why.

Then I was explaining to Bob L., as he wiped the dishes for me, about my inability to throw away damaged dishes. "I would much rather," I told him, "have had that cracked cup that you drank from at dinner (how you happened to get it is beyond me) smashed in a dozen pieces than to have it just slightly cracked." "Would you really like to have the cup broken?" he asked.

I assured him that I would. Without further ado, he picked it up and solemnly dropped it emphatically to the floor, and then asked, "Got any more?"

I had, and before I had time to waver, he had sent two nicked plates, a handleless cream pitcher, and a soup dish, minus an ear, crashing after the tea cup. It takes high resolve and strong nerve to do such a deed, but you have a grand and glorious sense of achievement once the wreckage is cleared away.

Need I tell you that Bob has a standing invitation to dinner!

Everyone knows that order is heaven's first law, and we struggling housewives can but hope that the law is enforced. In the meantime, we can put "a little bit of heaven" in our homes.

TWILIGHT

Beatrice E. Linford

Twilight, that most solemn hour
Wraps all the earth in gray,
And gives all nature time to pause
Before the close of day.
Twilight, when the weary world
Is straining every power
To keep tired eyes from drooping
Before the darkened hour,
Is soft and gray as a blanket,
Silent as a summer cloud,
Soothing as a mother's palm
Upon a child's head, bowed.

Twilight, strange and silent time,
Makes all the earth akin,
And one may hear the voice of God,
And feel the love therein.

The fashion show and a bazaar were conducted as features of the stake convention, which was attended by First Counselor Marianne C. Sharp, of the General Board of Relief Society, and Sister Leone G. Layton, a member of the Board. Well-made clothing, combining both beauty and utility, was modeled by the Relief Society women and their children. The bazaar was successful as entertainment and also as a means of adding to the stake treasury. One of the wards sold more than $100 worth of articles, and the others, also, made excellent financial returns for their efforts.

Alberta O. Doxey, President, Eastern States Mission Relief Society, submits the following enthusiastic report of the activities of the Chambersburg Branch: "Over one half of the membership is made up of young women, the youngest, eleven years of age. This little girl sews well and contributes her efforts at work meetings. The majority of the members are in the late teens and early twenties. Under the excellent leadership of Sister Hulda Fields, this society has grown and the true spirit of the Relief Society is evident in all of the meetings.

On October 3, 1947, this Society successfully launched itself into another year. This was in the form of an installation dinner and dance held in the home of Sister Hulda Fields. The program displayed the talent of the women and included a reading, a vocal duet, and a playlet which encouraged activity by depicting the women with the most responsibility at home as the most active in Relief Society, and so learning to live the most rich and full life.

The women all came dressed in formals, but the party was not too formal to enjoy some lively games following the program. Then came a fine dinner and dance. The general theme throughout was the organization of the first Relief Society according to the plan given by the Prophet Joseph Smith. A historical review of the Chambersburg Branch Relief Society was also presented.

"This branch has helped two families to help themselves and the members have canned 300 quarts of foodstuffs as their contribution to the Welfare work."

These sisters proudly take their places with the 105,000 members of this great internationally effective Relief Society, modern pioneer women carrying on the work so nobly begun by their pioneer ancestors."

Tightening the Knot
Alice Whitson Norton
66 ELL, Dot,' big Dean Alford exclaimed, after returning from their joyous honeymoon, "I guess it's time for us to settle down now and begin tightening the knot."

That's just an old saying in this community," Dean laughed, "but you might find it both amusing and helpful to glean the meaning of it for yourself." The young wife thought of the matter as she went about setting in order the cozy little house of which she was now mistress. But, reaching no sensible conclusion, she finally questioned Mrs. Carter, her next door neighbor, as to just what her husband had meant.

"tightening the knot," laughed Mrs. Carter, "is a familiar saying in this particular locality, one which I believe has been handed down from generation to generation among the families who have grown up here."

"But what does it mean?" Dot asked, with a bit of curiosity.

"It means just this," chuckled the older woman, "the things that men and women do that bind them closer together as their years of married life increase in number."

"Oh!" exclaimed Dot, in a tone that clearly revealed she knew very little more than she had a moment before. "It's like this," Mrs. Carter went on, "this small community prides itself on the few divorce cases registered against it, and one and all agree that it has been through the tightening of the marriage knot that such a condition exists."

"I guess I'm a little dull, Mrs. Carter," Dot answered, "but perhaps I will learn later on what weight tightening the marriage vows carries."

"IT had to learn," laughed Mrs. Carter, "when I first came here." But Mrs. West, the bride just before myself who came to live in the valley, advised me to visit with the neighbors and draw them out on the subject, and—well—" she finished softly, "doing just that opened my eyes considerably."

"But I'm a timid soul," Dot argued.

"Just the same," answered the woman, "visiting the folks living here and observing them closely will make you think seriously of the nice congenial neighborhood in which you have come to live."

IT is true Dot was timid, but she was also a keen observer, and through observation she soon discovered Esther Cooper, a very placid type of woman, living on perfectly congenial terms with her husband. She attributed the fact of her happy existence to keeping herself calm when her husband came home in a dark mood. When Dick arrived home like that, she explained, he wasn't the man she married, but only a tired, harassed business man who would recover his amiable disposition ever so much quicker by her leaving him alone.

"Oh, yes," she admitted, when Dot questioned her about it, "it took a little time to learn that. But once I did, I found that it tightened the knot considerably. You see, by one of the two of us remaining placid when the other is glum or nervous, no arguments can arise. And, after all, many a home begins its undoing by arguments. And by refraining from that one feminine attribute," laughed the soft-voiced woman, "I have a very happy home today, and my husband rarely comes to it now in a dark mood."

The tightening of the knot took on an entirely different aspect in the next case. Quite an elderly couple were Mr. and Mrs. Burk, whose comfortable home Dot and big Dean frequently enjoyed. Here Dot discussed the matter with the man.

"Oh," chuckled the husband good-naturedly, "I couldn't have accomplished even the half I have, if it hadn't been for my good wife. She's what one might call a seer—you know, good foresight, always looking ahead and planning, and because I discovered early in the game that her judgment was better than mine, we've worked wonderfully together."

Another man in the community attributed his success in married life to the rose-colored glasses his wife wore. No matter how dark and threatening the clouds might be above their heads, this good woman could always catch a glimpse of the silver lining.

"That," said the old man, as he went about serenely planting a row of bulbs along the old-fashioned walk leading from the house to the big front gate, "tightened our marriage knot."

Little Mrs. Tremble, the very busiest housewife in the whole neighborhood, and mother of seven children, gave credit for her happy life to the fact that she lived on what her husband provided, without complaining, and taught her children that mentality made them the equal of anybody, and that they had never been taught that money was considered wealth.

But it was from little Mrs. Joiner, who shared her home with both her mother and her sister-in-law, that Dot learned the greatest lesson. Such congeniality among three women Dot had never seen before. In her heart she pondered much on how it had come about, since her own relationship with her mother and her husband's sister was strained and unnatural.

Finally, the opportunity came and Dot sought an explanation.

"I really give myself credit for this priceless possession," confided Mrs. Joiner when Dot questioned her about it. You see," she added very softly, "I came from another state which, I am sorry to say, carries no such reputation as this, and when I arrived I was quick to sense I was unwanted in a family that, without me, was harmonious. My husband, realizing I wanted to be friendly with my in-laws, shared the truth with me. His mother and sister, he told me truthfully, resented the love he had to share among us, therefore they were jealous of me and my place."

"Well," said Dot, "you seem to have found a way around it, all right."

"Oh, yes," agreed the woman, "but it took both time and patience. My first move was to send John home frequently for a visit with his mother and sister alone. This hurt to the heart's core, but it gave them 212 a chance to discuss intimate things in which they felt at that time I had no share. Then I began inviting them to our home, and making them so thoroughly comfortable that they had no excuse for thinking I wanted to monopolize my husband's affections or to break him from his home ties. I made it a point to call his mother every morning, sometimes asking her to tell me John's favorite dish, and frequently requesting her, when she had told me, to come over and prepare it for the evening dinner.

"Then I began asking his mother to let me drive her when she wanted to run into town, or the sister to use my car, which was a wedding gift from my father. At first I was keenly aware they were puzzled over my attitude, but when they realized I was sincere in the matter, well—" she added softly, "I simply became one of them, and we've lived in perfect harmony ever since."

After that bit of information, Dot went home to do a little thinking on her own behalf. Three miles up the valley lived Dean's people. She had RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1948 been to see them twice, and his family had returned her visit both times, but there had been a chilly atmosphere between them.

Dean's mother was not her mother, nor was his sister her sister. 'They lived in their house,' and she and Dean lived in theirs; yet there were times when Dean had a faraway look in his eyes, and his firm lips drooped a bit at the corners. In a flash, Dot understood why, and resolved, as little Mrs. Joiner had done, she, too, would wipe out any sign of petty jealousy and become part of her husband's family. This took time, persistence, and patience, but today there is not a happier home in the valley than that of Dot and Dean Arnold, simply because Dot learned from her neighbors what it meant to tighten the marriage knot, and of her own accord she tightened the one binding her to the man of her choice.

What about your own marriage knot? Is it slipping? Look well into the matter, and if it is, make an effort to tighten the knot before the cord breaks.

BEAUTY Mabel Jones Gabbott

There were tall pines in the forest,
Weighted with needles, of green.
Great, massive oaks stood between them,
Dwarfing the cedars between.

And there was a slight, slender maple,
Gracefully tipped toward the sun,
Calmly aloof in a clearing,
Wearing her scarlet and dun.

Pine needles carpet the forest,
Oaks make a windbreak for all;
Why am I cheered most, remembering
The slight, slender maple last fall?

Soup - the Heart of the Meal Sara Mills

The tion in cooking can be reached only when the elementary flavors are lost imperceptibly in the new one; The man who wrote this had soup-making in mind, of that we are sure.

Soup is the heart, the very life beat,
Of the meal. Indeed, it can, and should be,
Often, in these days of zooming prices,
The meal itself. Too often soup is
Ignored, unless st comes in cans.
Not that canned soup should ever be spoken of lightly; It is one of the comforts and wonders of our age and should be well-stocked on the pantry shelf.

But now, we speak of soup as if we were first cousin to the French - soup that simmers gently and effortlessly on the kitchen stove. It is delicious to the taste, warming to the blood, and nourishing to the body and soul.
To know how to make it is to be a master of one of the finest arts of cooking.

For this kind of soup there is no definite recipe; The know-how is all important. Today, for those who are venturesome, we will try to con dense in a paragraph or so the knowledge we have gained from many pots of simmering soup stock.

Basic Soup Stock
2 lbs. Beef shank, cut in pieces
1 veal knuckle
1 cracked beef bone
Page 214
Water to cover generously
Herbs, thyme, rosemary, parsley, basil, marjoram, bay leaf, chives, etc.
5-6 peppercorns
2-3 leeks, sliced
1 large onion
2 carrots, sliced
3-4 stalks of celery, and celery leaves, dry or fresh
1-2 whole tomatoes, or tomato juice
Whole cloves
Salt and pepper

Variations
Vegetable soup
Tomato-rice soup
Tomato soup with pastes

Start the soup cooking either the day before, or early on the day it is to be used. For the very best results, you should have a big pottery vessel. A porcelain kettle is next best; after that, a heavy aluminum kettle.

Cover the soup meat and bones well with water.
You may add as much water as you wish, but remember, the more water, the weaker the stock.
Let the soup stand for one hour, then bring the kettle to a boil.
Let the stock boil rapidly for a few minutes until the scum is formed. Now gently and patiently remove all the scum.

After this, give the kettle a handful of salt and a few good shakes of pepper, and let it simmer gently for four or five hours.

About midway in the simmering process, add the onion, into which the 3 whole cloves have been firmly pressed.
Add also, the carrots, cut lengthwise into about four pieces, the leeks, split lengthwise, the celery, the peppercorns, and the herbs.

Seasoning, said a very great cook, should be done with grace, and grace applies particularly to herbs. If you are an herb enthusiast, you will need no advice.
If the art is new to you, use only a slight pinch until you become more expert.
You may use all the herbs listed above, and more, or only part of them, but use herbs.
Tie them in a little bag, if your soup is not to be strained.

Soup - the Heart of the Meal

Now, you have a basic stock with which you can do many things. First, however, remove the excess fat and the vegetables which were meant only for seasoning.
You may strain the soup and place it in the refrigerator for later use, or you may use it at once.

For vegetable soup, cut your vegetables finely - carrots, potatoes, string beans, celery, turnips, Italian squash, or fresh peas. Cook them in the stock just long enough to make them tender.
Near the end of the cooking, add enough tomatoes, solid pack or juice, to suit your taste. You may also use a small can of tomato hot sauce.
A package of frozen mixed vegetables may be used, or a can of mixed vegetables.

Sometimes you may care to add a cup of finely shredded cabbage about five minutes before the soup is removed from the stove.

Tomato-Rice Soup (Serves 6-8)
Soup stock - 2-3 quarts
1 pint of tomatoes (juice or solid), enough to suit taste
1-2 cans of condensed tomato soup
1 cup uncooked rice
1 cup finely diced carrots
1/4 cup shredded parsley

Cook these together until the rice is thoroughly tender.
Serve this soup, which is a hearty one, in colorful soup bowls, along with celery sticks and French bread.

Tomato Soup with Pastes
To the plain stock, add tomato juice with any number of the soup pastes: alphabet letters, tiny stars, melon-seed pastes, or the tiny shell-like pastes, vermicelli, or spaghetti.
Add to this, or any other soup, leftover vegetable juices.

If you are still willing to experiment, try making brown stock. This is done by rendering out the bone marrow and browning the lean meat in it.
Dried lentils, such as split peas, beans, lima beans, and garbanzos (chick-peas) are also good cooked in the stock.

When the soup stock does not seem rich enough, don't be afraid to add bouillon cubes. Give the kettle plenty of salt and a farewell shake of pepper.

Clouds
Jeanette P.

Pany I love a wispy, chiffon cloud Wind-serried, soft, and white. In cobalt blue of sunset's glow That melts into the night. A flame-edged cloud at early dawn, Marking the new day's beam; Even a thunderous black one That hides a rainbow's gleam.

PATTERN

John M. Freckhton

In perfect understanding.
Peace,
And perfect growth
Of love prevail,
For giving thoroughly
In faith.
Engenders trust
That cannot fail.

SOMETHING IS GLAD

Dorothy J. Roberts

Something in the eager child is sad
And wise, and too all-knowing and resigned.
And something in the older heart is glad
In dreams, despite his unbelieving mind;
Something incorruptible and good,
Something of creator that conceives.
Some power captive in the restless blood
That shapes his far perfection and believes.
