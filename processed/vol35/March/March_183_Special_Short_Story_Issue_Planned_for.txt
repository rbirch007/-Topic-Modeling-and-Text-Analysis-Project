Spring in Utah
Katherine Fernelius Larsen
Grate the raucous gulls swoop where the farmer tills,
And greening verdure stains dun Utah hills;
Red-budded, supple willows fringe the river
Where bluebirds flash bright plumage, and the quiver
Of sparkling sunlight prisms water's ripple;
The mountains rise to dazzling blue, with stipple
Of cloud wisps, white as snow still on their tips;
The meadow lark's clear carol rises, dips
Across the lowlands, and the uplands fling
Warm, pungent smell of sage to herald spring.

Pankapaw
Deone R. Sutherland
My husband, Harvey, after I graduating from _ college, signed a contract to teach school in Pankapaw.
"Where is Pankapaw?" I asked him, looking at the map.
I have never been able to find anything on a map.
"You can never find anything on a map," said Harvey, telling me that which I knew already.
"Pankapaw is a very important town in the southern part of this State. Pankapaw has fifteen hundred people and a very large high school. We shall be an asset to the community and I will learn a great deal about teaching school."
"Undoubtedly," I said, feeling convinced.
Harvey can sound very convincing.
My brother-in-law loaded his car.
"We cannot get anything more in the car or outside of the car," said my brother-in-law.

That is very true, I thought, looking at the bed strapped to the top of the car, the toaster on the fender, the quilts and canned tomato juice in the trunk, my hats squashed against the back window. I went back into my mother's house and conferred with Harvey. My sister said she and her husband would also drive a car down. "Two cars," I exclaimed brightly, "we shall go in style to Pankapaw, like a caravan, like gypsies!" Harvey does not like me to get ecstatic. He looked sourly at the flapping, crammed cars. "If the engine doesn't boil over into the things there some way. Toaster before we get there—or the bed slide off—or—" My mother handed us a lunch and said that, much as she hated to see us go, we had better go. "Do the cars look too disgraceful?" I whispered to my mother. "I do not want Pankapaw to get a bad impression of us, as if we were sheepherders or gypsies or something." I am a school teacher's wife now and must at all costs appear normal, I reminded myself. My mother frowned at the cars. "Well, no," she replied hesitantly. "After all, you have to get your things there some way. Toaster before we get there—or the bed slide off—or—" My mother reminisced fondly. "Your Uncle Alonza used to pack for touring the country. He was a crazy one." She is at times very consoling. "Your Uncle Alonza was crazy if a man ever was," my father used to say, pursing his lips at mother and shaking his head. "Your mother's family—' he would begin hopelessly to us, shrugging his shoulders and then, looking very doleful, he would read the paper again. "The things I could tell you about your father's family—' my mother would always retort. But my father would refuse to be roused from his paper so that we never heard the things my mother could have told us about papa's family if she had only cared to. "I shall trace our route on the map," I said happily. I get very excited when we go on a trip. Even while holding a box of bath towels PANKAPAW and a waffle iron I can be excited about traveling. "You are going the wrong way on the map," said Harvey to me. "We are going the opposite direction." The towns were too far in between, and I could not find the correct highway numbers, so I gave the map to Harvey. It discouraged me also to discover that I began getting thirsty in the exact center of the distance between two towns. I thought it could be psychological, so I quit looking at the map. There were other things to look at anyway. "Look at all the sagebrush," I said to Harvey. "It will be any time now," said Harvey. "Any time now we should be in Pankapaw." We had been traveling all afternoon, and the sun was sinking out beyond the gray sage and purple mountains. We began to look for Pankapaw. We found Pankapaw. We stopped the car. "Is this Pankapaw?" called my brother-in-law to a man walking along the street. He said it was. We were here, I guessed. "Now where?" We went to the home of the superintendent of schools. He was to take us to our apartment. "He is out seeing to his milch cows, but we expect him home any time now," said his wife. Our two cars with the bed on top pulled up and parked in front of the superintendent's house. Harvey walked up the street. We didn't look at the cars. The superintendent's wife stared at the cars, and then her three children came out and stared. We waited. They had an apartment for us. We carried in the things. It was a very small apartment. The bed, when put up, filled the bedroom. We stood out in the hall and talked after we had unloaded the cars. "Won't you stay to dinner?" I said to everyone. Harvey looked at me. The others answered too quickly. They had to get started back; it was very late; they were very tired; they had to get started on the long trip back. "Well, here we are," I said profoundly and cheerfully to Harvey. Harvey was asleep on the bed, surrounded by boxes. I looked out the window. It was dark already. We had been driving all afternoon and were tired. Pankapaw, I murmured, Pankapaw. The night was dark at the window. There was no answer from Pankapaw. T dawn, from a great distance, I heard Harvey's alarm clock. I turned over. Harvey was sitting up in bed looking at a sheet of paper. "What is it, Harvey?" I asked. It was just beginning to get light at the window. It was dawn in Pankapaw, cold dawn, and I was tired. "I am reading my instructions for today," answered Harvey. "We, all the teachers, are to go on a field trip. We are to look at various grazing areas." He folded his paper and crawled out of bed. "Right now?" I yelled. He turned around. "Unpack while I am gone." The bed was cold and lonely. I stepped over the boxes and went out into the kitchen. I could hear Harvey gargling in the bathroom. Well, anyway, he won't expect any breakfast with this mess about, I thought. I sat on Harvey's old college alligator bag, which was piled on top of the only kitchen chair that I could see. "Where's breakfast?" demanded 188 Harvey, poking his soapy head out of the bathroom. I decided that there would be no point in suggesting that we eat out. I got down off the alligator bag. Well, I have plenty of things I can do while he is gone today, I thought. The apartment was very quiet. Perhaps I should look first at the town a bit. I stepped over a box of dishes and the juicer toward the door. It would probably cheer me up to step outside where I could no longer see this—this—I gestured vaguely at the mounds filling our miniature living room. I came back in half an hour. The town is very pretty, I thought. I liked trees and country roads and there was a courthouse clock that struck the hour. There was now nothing left but to unpack. At five o'clock in the afternoon I went down and sat on the front porch to wait for Harvey. Everything was ready for Harvey. He did not come. The wind rustled the autumn leaves, and Pankapaw was a long way from home, and I had seen the whole town in half an hour. I began to feel uncomfortable. At half past five I went upstairs and thought about packing up again. After all, we really didn't know too much about Pankapaw. I turned the heat under the food off and then on again. Perhaps Harvey would not mind if I went home briefly, to visit my parents, I said to myself, while picking out the burned parts of the potatoes and throwing them in the garbage.

I sat down by the living room clock. I began not to like Harvey a great deal. At six o'clock I turned all the burners on the stove off and went down and sat on the front porch again. I could RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�MARCH 1948 see the Pankapaw High School across the field. It looked deserted and lonely. A lone leaf hurtled across the lawn, orange in the setting sun. "Harvey," I moaned. A truck stopped in front and let Harvey out. Somebody hollered, "We didn't keep him too long, Mrs. Thompson, did we?" And then, "Ha! Hal hal" floated out. From the inside of the truck. Ha, ha, I thought bitterly. "No, no," I called out. Harvey came up the walk. "Where have you been?" I said to Harvey. "Looking at sagebrush," Harvey said. We went up the stairs. "All day, just looking at sagebrush. Some of it's fenced in and some of it isn't�" I quit listening to him. Something was smoking in the kitchen. I must have missed a burner. Harvey washed and then he ate and then he lay down on the couch and closed his eyes. "Harvey," I said. "Harvey, I unpacked." "Yeah," said Harvey, and he turned over on his side facing the wall. "What good does it do to look at sagebrush, Harvey?" I asked. "Harvey!" "It's all very scientific," said Harvey, still with his back to me. He sounded very tired. "There's a very scientific purpose to the whole thing �I'll tell you about it tomorrow� glub, glub," said Harvey. I went into the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bathtub. I felt very bad. I rested my forehead on the cold water faucet and thought about streetcars and trolley cars and taxis and busses and the lovely dinners we had at home. �Glub,� I choked against the faucet. PANKAPAW Harvey came in and sat by me on the bathtub. He put his arm around me, which made me feel worse. "Glub glub," I moaned into the bathtub. "Do not feel bad," said Harvey. "I will tell you all about the grazing O's of outside of Pankapaw. I will tell you all this scientific stuff, Nitwit." Harvey can be very kind and affectionate when he wishes to be.

FOR four days at the crack of dawn Harvey's alarm would ring and I would wake up to find Harvey sitting up in bed reading his typewritten instructions for the day. It is very lonely being the wife of a schoolteacher, I thought. Especially since school has not yet even begun.

And then school did begin. I sat on the side of the bathtub watching Harvey tie his tie before the only mirror in our apartment. "Are you nervous?" I said to him. He did not answer. He jerked at his tie. "Do not worry," I said. "Anyway, more than likely none of the students will be larger than you." Harvey is quite tall, but still he did not look consoled. Sometimes it is very hard to be a helpmeet kind of wife. "And you do know a great deal about various things�"

Harvey patted me on the shoulder, reached for his books, and ran down the stairs. Harvey was a schoolteacher. I ate Harvey's cold toast that he had left and thought about being a school teacher's wife. At eleven o'clock Harvey came running home.

"The boys have locked some girls in a closet, and we can't get them out." He grabbed some keys. "Goodbye," he called, running down the stairs, his tie flying out behind.

I thought about being a schoolteacher.

Harvey was very busy. He had to sponsor the school paper, put on the school play, and help sponsor a class. He was also supposed to teach six classes. "So many�" I said. But Harvey was too busy studying to answer me. I went to the library for another armload of books for me to read. I admired the oleander plant in the library, selected my books, lingered, looking at the first stars coming out, and then went up to the tiny apartment, and found Harvey still studying. Sometimes, I thought, life can be very dull.

We began taking the newspaper from home so that we would not be so homesick. The News came down to Pankapaw on the bus and then had to be delivered after that. We would doze off while waiting for the paper to come. It seemed better to stay awake at night and read it then than to get it in the morning and read it a day late. Once in a while we would take turns staying awake for it. But it usually took both Harvey and me to find it. We had no flashlight, so we would go down where it was time and strike matches. We would search first the length of the porch. One night we found it easily�on the edge of the porch, but usually it was off somewhere among the leaves on the big dark stretch of lawn or in the weeds near the ditch. We would strike matches and hunt for it. We always felt very triumphant when we would finally find it.

It was while hunting for the paper one night that Harvey told me about the party. "We are going on a party," said Harvey. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE 1948 "With the senior class," said Harvey, "up the canyon." Then we found the paper.

The next night he came in. "We have to leave for Pankapaw Canyon in five minutes," he said. "Get ready." I looked at the dinner-none of which had turned out badly�and began to hunt for my sweaters and old riding breeches. I was pulling on my pants when the truckload of seniors began to honk and shout down below our window from the street.

"Come on," yelled Harvey.
I ran down the stairs and tried to look dignified while running for the truck. Harvey boosted me on and the students pulled. We were going in a cement truck that belonged to the father of one of the students. Fine cement floated in the air. I coughed and hung onto Harvey.

"The wind is certainly strong," I said to one of the girls and nearly fell out of the truck. The truck had turned a corner.

"Nearly lost you that time," said the girl.
"You certainly did," I said.
"Stay in the truck," said Harvey.
"I certainly will," I said and hung onto Harvey, seniors, and, now and then, the side of the truck.

Pankapaw Canyon had turned orange-brown for fall. It was nearly October. I had forgotten that we had been in Pankapaw a month.

"We've been here a month," I shouted to Harvey.
"What?" he yelled, squinting in the wind.
"Beautiful canyon," I said.
"What?" he yelled, turning so that his hair blew across his eyes.
"Look, pine trees," I shouted. And the truck stopped and we got out
and brushed the dust and cement from us. My knees hurt and I walked toward the hemlock under the pines and aspens to rest.

HARVEY shouted for me to come back, that we were going on a treasure hunt.

We chose up sides and that was the last I saw of my side. I found the history teacher caught in a thicket on the side of a mountain and helped her get loose. When we got back to the camp, everyone was eating and putting Harvey on the back. His side had won. I sat down by the fire and watched the red bumps rise on my legs from the stinging nettle. Harvey brought me some food.
"Not one clue," I said to Harvey, "not one clue did I get a chance to see. I never saw anybody after that first wild shout and scramble except Miss Horne here." I looked at Miss Horne. She looked very pale.
Miss Horne smiled at me. "We do this several times a year," she said.
Harvey pushed my hot dog at me, and after that I felt fine when the throng came pale yellow and round through the trees, when the sound of the creek bubbled from off in the dark somewhere, and then the students, sitting on logs around the fire, began to sing. They sang the Pankapaw High School song and Harvey held my hand.
"Everything is lovely," I said to Harvey. "Perfectly lovely," I said looking carefully, listening to the students' sing. And then they gave three cheers for Harvey, and I wanted to stand up and cheer for Harvey, too, but he said to wait until I got home and he pulled me down.
"Hurrah," I said, anyway, very softly. "Hurrah for Pankapaw." 
PANKAPAW knew I was being carried away and was being slightly sentimental, but I couldn't help it. I did not even mind the cold windy gale of the ride home back down the canyon. "Hurrah," I gasped, swaying on the truck, losing my breath in the wind. "Hurrah!" It was our anniversary, I decided the next day. One month in Pankapaw. I bought candles and kept stirring everything on burners turned down as low as they would go. Nothing can happen tonight, I said. I went out looking for something to fill our one vase. Harvey came in and sat down. He did not notice the candles. He did not come out into the kitchen to see what we were going to eat. He did not say anything about it being one month. He took out a check and gave it to me. "There were a lot of deductions," he said. T looked at the check and the deductions. "Surely are," I said. "They have deducted the money we were going to pay for the rent." I looked at my budget. "Of course, some of it you get back in the end," said Harvey. "Yes," I said, looking at my budget. It was not the rent money they could deduct. Maybe it would have to be the food money, or something. 194 "Mother can send us canned stuff," I said. "I'm best at opening cans." I patted the sage decorating our one vase. It was gray-green and looked rather nice in a yellow vase, I thought. From the kitchen window we watched the moon rise. "Pankapaw has nice moons, anyway," said Harvey. I agreed. He reached across the table and held my hand. "Real nice," said Harvey. Someone knocked on the door. It was a student. "Mr. Thompson, some of the kids are over to the school waiting to rehearse—thought we'd better—" "Oh, yes," said Harvey. "Tl be right over." He hurried into the bedroom and began putting on his coat. I went over to the typewriter and began to type. I wrote, "My husband, Harvey, after graduating from college—" Harvey leaned over my shoulder. "What are you writing?" "It's a story," I said, "about us." "Ts nothing sacred?" asked my husband, hurrying out the door. I could hear Harvey and the student running down the steps, banging out the hall. I laughed and wrote: "signed a contract to teach school in Pankapaw—" 
PARTING Adeline R. Ensign
There always comes a parting time When we must say goodbye, When sadness fills the lonely hearts And teardrops dim the eye.
For time is ever passing on, Nor would we change the plan, For when God gave us life he knew That tears were good for man.
And so, as sorrows come along, Oh, give us strength, we pray, And give us faith and courage, Lord, Sufficient for each day.

REMEMBER AND FORGET Della Adams Leitner
Have I—have I forgotten? Stay, my heart; Be not so quick to censure careless ways, Daydreams and laughter and neglected tasks, The disregard of time, the drifting days, All so a part of adolescent youth, Trying the patience of the older mind; Oh, thinking back, remember—then forget The intervening years.... You will be kind.

CHAPTER 2
Synopsis: Anne Raines, influenced by her sister Della, has persuaded her husband Joe to agree to sell their ranch home. Joe, planning to look for work in the city, leaves the ranch, and Anne, worried over the responsibility of looking after the place, feels a premonition of trouble ahead.
IT was noon of the next day and Anne stood in the doorway holding a telegram in her hand. The words seemed to melt and fuse together ". . . Joe seriously injured in automobile accident . . . in hospital . . . will write . . . Della."
A flood of tragic experiences crowded the next few days. Joe's condition continued doubtful.

Della rushed back in her car and took Anne and the children to the city, where Anne hovered over her unconscious husband for hours before he even knew her. Then, there were many more hours of anxiety before Joe's condition was considered fairly safe. Even then, he would have to spend months in the hospital.
All this Anne had to face, then choose her course. There was no time for regrets or self-sympathy, and there was no time to think about the future. The present required every waking moment.
Back on the homestead, she went to work, not only milking the cows, caring for the horses, and caring for her garden. With a fierce and sudden pride, she determined to show Joe she could really take care of things. She hardly noticed the passing of time, except to get the brief messages telling of his condition.
Page 194
Anne was trying to summarize these rapid events and reduce them to some sort of ordered control as she picked the first green peas from the garden. She was canning them—piles of them; and the corn was coming on promisingly, too. Food, for which she had never lacked in her life, suddenly became a matter of great importance. Millions in the world were starving; besides, with Joe unlikely to work for many months, she forgot about her dream home in town, and began planning where they could remain on the farm during the winter while his broken bones continued to mend, if they had plenty of food stored away, and the cows to give them milk.
Even Dick and Betsy were becoming useful under her careful guidance.
"Momie, I got this row of carrots weeded," cried Dick from the bottom of the garden.
"Thanks, Darling, now you can rest awhile."
"But I don't want to rest. I want to help raise food for the hungry people."
Though she recognized in these words an immediate fulfillment of her own teaching, she was struck with their childish sincerity. Mopping the perspiration from her face, she struggled with a choking feeling in her throat, and a swift vision of little Dickie going off to war some day tortured her.
"What did you say, Momie?" "Nothing, Darling, but you can weed a little more if you want to."
At that moment, Betsy came down from the house with jam from her breakfast still on her cheeks. "Momie, I will pick some weeds," she volunteered, her round face serious, and her blue eyes sparkling.
"Thanks, Honey. I'm afraid you'll pick the wrong weeds. How would you like to help mother gather peas?"
"Fine!" Betsy lost no time getting busy.
A little later, she heard Dick talking angrily, and throwing stones as hard as he could, whereupon she discovered he was after a squirrel he had caught invading the garden.
"Momie, come here," he finally called urgently. "The squirrels are eating our cabbages and cauliflowers. Oh, look, they've ruined them!"
ANNE hurried to the bottom of the garden. A sudden instinctive dread clutched at her heart. So the squirrels were beginning to get bad. She looked back at the wheat, now springing green on the sidehill, after which she inspected the havoc wrought among her cabbages, and began to experience a tragic fear such as she imagined people felt in the presence of an invading army. She met the fiery gaze in her son's eyes, and a shadow crept into her own.
"We'll have to fight them, that's all. Get some traps from the granary. I wonder if they've started to bother the wheat. We'll have to set out some poison." Anne took off her straw hat and fanned her warm face, then straightened her shoulders. She had a little war all of her own.
A car came up the road, holding her somewhat spellbound in an effort to see who was arriving. But she failed to recognize the driver until the car stopped in the yard a few feet from her. Then, a tall angular man, with a weatherbeaten face and a hooked nose, got out and came toward her. She recognized Sam Hadfield.
"Howdy, Mrs. Raines," he greeted stiffly. "Seems as if you're havin' a pretty tough time of it this summer."
"Oh, yes, but I can manage all right," she replied weakly. She had never liked Hadfield, and now, his sudden appearance seemed to be an ill omen. "I—I find the squirrels are bothering my garden a little."
"Well, Mrs. Raines, there's no use of a city woman like you monkeying with a garden, or anything else out in this wilderness. Nothin'll grow in these hills, anyway, except a little bunch grass and enough cattle and sheep to eat it up." He came uncomfortably close; his small, deep-set eyes searched hers.
Anne experienced a feeling of helplessness. "I can manage," she declared.
Hadfield lingered, wavering between embarrassment and an unspoken purpose. Finally he spoke—gruffly. "I think you'd better pack up and go to the city, where you can take care of Joe. I can take everything over now. I made Joe promise to stay till fall. But now, he's hurt. I want to help all I can."
"I—I couldn't leave now," Anne stammered, realizing for the first time the stark reality of letting someone else take possession. A scowl flitted across Hadfield's face. "Maybe, Joe didn't tell you everything. You see I've bought the place. I argued Joe into stayin' awhile." He grinned impressive and would have taken hold of her arm had she not moved. "Of course, I ain't puttin' you off—not yet," he assured in a tone suggesting irritation and a mild threat. "I thought you'd be anxious to go."
"We are staying," Anne replied artlessly. Her tone seemed to convey the impression she failed to get the full impact of his meaning, rather than that she was defying him, yet the effect was equally conclusive.
"Er, er, well, I'll be going," he said lamely. "But I'll see you later. How's Joe getting along the last you heard?" "Very well, thanks. But his legs are both broken, so it'll be a long while before he'll be able to do anything." Still, Hadfield was loath to go. He lingered, trying to flatter her with rude compliments and veiled hints concerning the uselessness of her efforts. When he did finally leave, the sun seemed scorching hot, though it was only half way to noon, and the moisture on her face evaporated, leaving her cheeks dry and hot, as she stared at his car until it reached the county road. Dick called her as he came down from the granary with some traps, and little Betsy sidled up to her.
"What's the matter, Momie?" she inquired seeing tears in her mother's eyes. Anne seemed to find no words to answer. A hawk sailed through the clear blue, casting its racing shadow along the edge of the yard, and suddenly reminding her of danger to her small chickens and hens.
"Dick! Betsy!" she suddenly urged. "Let's chase that hawk away. It might kill some of our chickens." She ran up the path, with the children following.

Then, with determined efficiency, she crowded the chicks, which their frightened mothers had already gathered to the best of her ability, in their pens, where she knew they would be safe. Then, suddenly giving way to her feelings, she took the children in her arms and opened the floodgate of her tears. Vaguely, she sensed an approaching crisis with Hadfield, who seemed to believe he had a title to the farm, and suddenly, she realized she had no desire to sell the homestead ever! Della wrote at the end of the week, demanding that Anne prepare to come home at once. "Get somebody—anybody—to look after the crop. That forsaken place is not for a woman to run single-handed," wrote her practical, sympathetic sister. In a way, Anne was hungry to accept the invitation. She wanted so much to be near Joe. She made several attempts to answer the letter, but she tore them up, in the end merely writing a brief note, signifying her determination to stay and take care of the farm. This course seemed right, and that was all that mattered.

Joe was still unable to write, but he sent word to let Hadfield take over. "I can't let you stay there any longer, Honey," he wrote.
But Anne wrote back: "Don't worry about me, Darling. Your job is to get better. I'm doing wonderfully well. You see I can say that since there's no one else here to say it for me. I'm actually learning to like it, and both Dickie and Betsy are becoming real farmers."

She smiled when she mailed the letter, and was still thinking about it that evening as she went up to the hilltop to let the breeze cool her cheeks, while she watched the sun set at the close of what seemed an endless day. It seemed as if Joe was beside her; she could hear his voice as if he had sounded the evening she had seen him give up his last effort to cling to the homestead.

Had she been right? Yes, she reflected. We simply can't spend our lives here, entirely. Yet, as she looked out into the fathomless gloaming, she knew now she loved every inch of the rough acres they had toiled to subdue, and the thought of turning them over to an unsympathetic stranger was equally heartbreaking. Why do decisions have to be so far-reaching? Why can't life offer more compromises? she cried in anguish.

A mourning dove cooed in a distant hollow; she turned and walked down the dusty trail toward the house.
Della finally drove out to the farm. She was amazed to find her sister milking the cows, and little Dick tugging at the pump handle to get some water for the horses. Even Betsy was doing her bit by carrying some of the water to the chickens in a small bucket. Della was even more amazed when she saw Anne turn the cream separator, feed the calves and the pigs, and the horses. She scolded her, and made some real attempts to help, but in neither case was she very successful. She concluded somewhat helplessly that the most surprising thing was Anne's sturdy independence. She seemed to mind the farm less with its backbreaking cares than she had previously done with Joe at home to carry the heaviest part of the work.

But Della was good at argument. "You can't stay here another day. I'm going to take you home with me," she insisted.
"I'm going to stay all summer, and as much longer as necessary to take care of the crops," retorted Anne.
"Listen here, Girlie, what do you think you are, a regiment of infantry? The hay will have to be cut. Can you cut it? No. The cattle will have to be kept out of the grain. Can you do it? Of course not. And please don't tell me you're going to do the heading and threshing." Della ended her recital of difficulties with a devastating truth.
"Well, anyway, let's go up to the house and get some supper," replied Anne mildly, as she completed her chores. "I think I can still cook."

She felt incapable of winning an argument with her strong-willed sister; but something inside her—something very stubborn and defiant—gave her a feeling of triumph she couldn't express. She had come to think of the farm as a trust left with her. She had grown, also, to feel proud of her gardening, and her shining. She had to admit some of the large responsibilities were still in the future, consequently she still had them to meet. "You'd be surprised what I can do," she finally said, teasingly, as they entered the house. "Surprised! Maybe you think I'm not already. But enough's enough. You're quitting."

"Aunt" Delia," cried Dick, rushing into the house after a mysterious excursion through the garden and up along the edge of the wheat, "I'm trapping. I'm cleaning the squirrels out."
"Ugh," Della gasped. "Surely, you're not letting him—"
"Oh, yes, Dickie's a man now."

In the end Della returned to the city, declaring that she was no longer equal to the task of looking after Anne and the children. Meanwhile, the summer days grew hotter, and the wheat struggled for growth on the hillside, while the lucerne came into bloom in the small field below the ditch. The squirrels began to nibble at the edges of the grain, which immediately responded by turning a sickening yellow; but Anne set out poison and destroyed them. And when the proper time came, she mowed and raked the hay; then hired it stacked. Promising to pay for it when the threshing was done.

"I'm learning to appreciate the beauty of living close to the good earth," she wrote to Della. "Yes, I'm learning to be a farmer." She was gloating over these achievements the morning Sam Hadfield again drove into the yard. "Well, Mrs. Raines, I see you're sticking it out better than I thought you could. But the worst part's coming. Cattle are driftin' in from the mountains now, and they'll be crowdin' the fences to get into your wheat. Why don't you let me look after it. I'll get it 'cut as soon as possible, then I can let my cattle come right in. I expect to use this place, you know, as a fall pasture."

It took a mighty effort on Anne's part to remain unruffled at this poorly disguised assumption of ownership, yet she steadied herself to meet the issue. "Have you actually bought this place from my husband, or did you merely make him an offer?" she inquired as casually as she was able.

Hadfield was taken back by this sally, but he was ready for it. "Why—er—I bought it. That is | paid him a payment on it to bind the bargain. He said he wanted some money to pay on a place in town."

Anne felt herself growing faint.

"Oh, I see." Joe hadn't said anything to her about a payment, and she had been under the impression they had merely come to some sort of verbal agreement which could not be considered binding. "May—may I ask the price agreed on?" Hadfield, still sitting in his can, tried to dodge the question, but she wouldn't let him. "I'm paying him ten dollars an acre," he blurted. "Why, that's robbery! It's worth three times that much. I won't agree. I'll fight it." Anne was trembling from head to foot, but never in her life before had she been so determined. "I'm going at once to see Joe about this. We're not going to sell—at all." "You've already sold," Hadfield half snarled, driving away. (To be concluded) 

Sentiment and Sanitation (Continued from page 179)

To dinner. These dishes were my particular trial because, no matter how far I put them back in the cupboard, they managed to escape occasionally and would show up on the table at the most inopportune times. Yet, regardless of my resolution to send chipped plates and cracked cups to the ash can, as soon as the damage occurred, I kept them around. Do not ask me why.

Then I was explaining to Bob L., as he wiped the dishes for me, about my inability to throw away damaged dishes. "I would much rather," I told him, "have had that cracked cup that you drank from at dinner (how you happened to get it is beyond me) smashed in a dozen pieces than to have it just slightly cracked." "Would you really like to have the cup broken?" he asked.

I assured him that I would. Without further ado, he picked it up and solemnly dropped it emphatically to the floor, and then asked, "Got any more?"

I had, and before I had time to waver, he had sent two nicked plates, a handleless cream pitcher, and a soup dish, minus an ear, crashing after the tea cup. It takes high resolve and strong nerve to do such a deed, but you have a grand and glorious sense of achievement once the wreckage is cleared away.

Need I tell you that Bob has a standing invitation to dinner!

Everyone knows that order is heaven's first law, and we struggling housewives can but hope that the law is enforced. In the meantime, we can put "a little bit of heaven" in our homes.

TWILIGHT

Beatrice E. Linford

Twilight, that most solemn hour
Wraps all the earth in gray,
And gives all nature time to pause
Before the close of day.
Twilight, when the weary world
Is straining every power
To keep tired eyes from drooping
Before the darkened hour,
Is soft and gray as a blanket,
Silent as a summer cloud,
Soothing as a mother's palm
Upon a child's head, bowed.

Twilight, strange and silent time,
Makes all the earth akin,
And one may hear the voice of God,
And feel the love therein.

Layton, a member of the Board. Well-made clothing, combining both beauty and utility, was modeled by the Relief Society women and their children. The bazaar was successful as entertainment and also as a means of adding to the stake treasury. One of the wards sold more than $100 worth of articles, and the others, also, made excellent financial returns for their efforts.

Alberta O.

This little girl sews well and contributes her efforts at work meetings. The majority of the members are in the late teens and early twenties. Under the excellent leadership of Sister Hulda Fields, this society has grown and the true spirit of the Relief Society is evident in all of the meetings.

On October 3, 1947, this Society successfully launched itself into another year. This was in the form of an installation dinner and dance held in the home of Sister Hulda Fields. The program displayed the talent of the women and included a reading, a vocal duet, and a playlet which encouraged activity by depicting the women with the most responsibility at home as the most active in Relief Society, and so learning to live the most rich and full life.

The women all came dressed in formals, but the party was not too formal to enjoy some lively games following the program. Then came a fine dinner and dance. The general theme throughout was the organization of the first Relief Society according to the plan given by the Prophet Joseph Smith. A historical review of the Chambersburg Branch Relief Society was also presented.

"This branch has helped two families to help themselves and the members have canned 300 quarts of foodstuffs as their contribution to the Welfare work."

These sisters proudly take their places with the 105,000 members of this great internationally effective Relief Society, modern pioneer women carrying on the work so nobly begun by their pioneer ancestors."

"Selfsame roots Have various tops."

Tightening the Knot
Alice Whitson Norton
66 ELL, Dot,' big Dean Alford exclaimed, after returning from their joyous honeymoon, "I guess it's time for us to settle down now and begin tightening the knot."

That's just an old saying in this community," Dean laughed, "but you might find it both amusing and helpful to glean the meaning of it for yourself." The young wife thought of the matter as she went about setting in order the cozy little house of which she was now mistress. But, reaching no sensible conclusion, she finally questioned Mrs. Carter, her next door neighbor, as to just what her husband had meant.

"tightening the knot," laughed Mrs. Carter, "is a familiar saying in this particular locality, one which I believe has been handed down from generation to generation among the families who have grown up here."

"But what does it mean?" Dot asked, with a bit of curiosity.

"It means just this," chuckled the older woman, "the things that men and women do that bind them closer together as their years of married life increase in number."

"Oh!" exclaimed Dot, in a tone that clearly revealed she knew very little more than she had a moment before. "It's like this," Mrs. Carter went on, "this small community prides itself on the few divorce cases registered against it, and one and all agree that it has been through the tightening of the marriage knot that such a condition exists."

"I guess I'm a little dull, Mrs. Carter," Dot answered, "but perhaps I will learn later on what weight tightening the marriage vows carries."

"IT had to learn," laughed Mrs. Carter, "when I first came here." But Mrs. West, the bride just before myself who came to live in the valley, advised me to visit with the neighbors and draw them out on the subject, and—well—" she finished softly, "doing just that opened my eyes considerably."

"But I'm a timid soul," Dot argued.

"Just the same," answered the woman, "visiting the folks living here and observing them closely will make you think seriously of the nice congenial neighborhood in which you have come to live."

IT is true Dot was timid, but she was also a keen observer, and through observation she soon discovered Esther Cooper, a very placid type of woman, living on perfectly congenial terms with her husband. She attributed the fact of her happy existence to keeping herself calm when her husband came home in a dark mood. When Dick arrived home like that, she explained, he wasn't the man she married, but only a tired, harassed business man who would recover his amiable disposition ever so much quicker by her leaving him alone.

"Oh, yes," she admitted, when Dot questioned her about it, "it took a little time to learn that. But once I did, I found that it tightened the knot considerably. You see, by one of the two of us remaining placid when the other is glum or nervous, no arguments can arise. And, after all, many a home begins its undoing by arguments. And by refraining from that one feminine attribute," laughed the soft-voiced woman, "I have a very happy home today, and my husband rarely comes to it now in a dark mood."

The tightening of the knot took on an entirely different aspect in the next case. Quite an elderly couple were Mr. and Mrs. Burk, whose comfortable home Dot and big Dean frequently enjoyed. Here Dot discussed the matter with the man.

"Oh," chuckled the husband good-naturedly, "I couldn't have accomplished even the half I have, if it hadn't been for my good wife. She's what one might call a seer—you know, good foresight, always looking ahead and planning, and because I discovered early in the game that her judgment was better than mine, we've worked wonderfully together."

Another man in the community attributed his success in married life to the rose-colored glasses his wife wore. No matter how dark and threatening the clouds might be above their heads, this good woman could always catch a glimpse of the silver lining.

"That," said the old man, as he went about serenely planting a row of bulbs along the old-fashioned walk leading from the house to the big front gate, "tightened our marriage knot."

Little Mrs. Tremble, the very busiest housewife in the whole neighborhood, and mother of seven children, gave credit for her happy life to the fact that she lived on what her husband provided, without complaining, and taught her children that mentality made them the equal of anybody, and that they had never been taught that money was considered wealth.

But it was from little Mrs. Joiner, who shared her home with both her mother and her sister-in-law, that Dot learned the greatest lesson. Such congeniality among three women Dot had never seen before. In her heart she pondered much on how it had come about, since her own relationship with her mother and her husband's sister was strained and unnatural.

Finally, the opportunity came and Dot sought an explanation.

"I really give myself credit for this priceless possession," confided Mrs. Joiner when Dot questioned her about it. You see," she added very softly, "I came from another state which, I am sorry to say, carries no such reputation as this, and when I arrived I was quick to sense I was unwanted in a family that, without me, was harmonious. My husband, realizing I wanted to be friendly with my in-laws, shared the truth with me. His mother and sister, he told me truthfully, resented the love he had to share among us, therefore they were jealous of me and my place."

"Well," said Dot, "you seem to have found a way around it, all right."

"Oh, yes," agreed the woman, "but it took both time and patience. My first move was to send John home frequently for a visit with his mother and sister alone. This hurt to the heart's core, but it gave them 212 a chance to discuss intimate things in which they felt at that time I had no share. Then I began inviting them to our home, and making them so thoroughly comfortable that they had no excuse for thinking I wanted to monopolize my husband's affections or to break him from his home ties. I made it a point to call his mother every morning, sometimes asking her to tell me John's favorite dish, and frequently requesting her, when she had told me, to come over and prepare it for the evening dinner.

"Then I began asking his mother to let me drive her when she wanted to run into town, or the sister to use my car, which was a wedding gift from my father. At first I was keenly aware they were puzzled over my attitude, but when they realized I was sincere in the matter, well—" she added softly, "I simply became one of them, and we've lived in perfect harmony ever since."

After that bit of information, Dot went home to do a little thinking on her own behalf. Three miles up the valley lived Dean's people. She had RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MARCH 1948 been to see them twice, and his family had returned her visit both times, but there had been a chilly atmosphere between them.

Dean's mother was not her mother, nor was his sister her sister. 'They lived in their house,' and she and Dean lived in theirs; yet there were times when Dean had a faraway look in his eyes, and his firm lips drooped a bit at the corners. In a flash, Dot understood why, and resolved, as little Mrs. Joiner had done, she, too, would wipe out any sign of petty jealousy and become part of her husband's family. This took time, persistence, and patience, but today there is not a happier home in the valley than that of Dot and Dean Arnold, simply because Dot learned from her neighbors what it meant to tighten the marriage knot, and of her own accord she tightened the one binding her to the man of her choice.

What about your own marriage knot? Is it slipping? Look well into the matter, and if it is, make an effort to tighten the knot before the cord breaks.

BEAUTY Mabel Jones Gabbott

There were tall pines in the forest,
Weighted with needles, of green.
Great, massive oaks stood between them,
Dwarfing the cedars between.

And there was a slight, slender maple,
Gracefully tipped toward the sun,
Calmly aloof in a clearing,
Wearing her scarlet and dun.

Pine needles carpet the forest,
Oaks make a windbreak for all;
Why am I cheered most, remembering
The slight, slender maple last fall?

Soup - the Heart of the Meal Sara Mills

The tion in cooking can be reached only when the elementary flavors are lost imperceptibly in the new one; The man who wrote this had soup-making in mind, of that we are sure.

Soup is the heart, the very life beat,
Of the meal. Indeed, it can, and should be,
Often, in these days of zooming prices,
The meal itself. Too often soup is
Ignored, unless st comes in cans.
Not that canned soup should ever be spoken of lightly; It is one of the comforts and wonders of our age and should be well-stocked on the pantry shelf.

But now, we speak of soup as if we were first cousin to the French - soup that simmers gently and effortlessly on the kitchen stove. It is delicious to the taste, warming to the blood, and nourishing to the body and soul.
To know how to make it is to be a master of one of the finest arts of cooking.

For this kind of soup there is no definite recipe; The know-how is all important. Today, for those who are venturesome, we will try to con dense in a paragraph or so the knowledge we have gained from many pots of simmering soup stock.

Basic Soup Stock
2 lbs. Beef shank, cut in pieces
1 veal knuckle
1 cracked beef bone
Page 214
Water to cover generously
Herbs, thyme, rosemary, parsley, basil, marjoram, bay leaf, chives, etc.
5-6 peppercorns
2-3 leeks, sliced
1 large onion
2 carrots, sliced
3-4 stalks of celery, and celery leaves, dry or fresh
1-2 whole tomatoes, or tomato juice
Whole cloves
Salt and pepper

Variations
Vegetable soup
Tomato-rice soup
Tomato soup with pastes

Start the soup cooking either the day before, or early on the day it is to be used. For the very best results, you should have a big pottery vessel. A porcelain kettle is next best; after that, a heavy aluminum kettle.

Cover the soup meat and bones well with water.
You may add as much water as you wish, but remember, the more water, the weaker the stock.
Let the soup stand for one hour, then bring the kettle to a boil.
Let the stock boil rapidly for a few minutes until the scum is formed. Now gently and patiently remove all the scum.

After this, give the kettle a handful of salt and a few good shakes of pepper, and let it simmer gently for four or five hours.

About midway in the simmering process, add the onion, into which the 3 whole cloves have been firmly pressed.
Add also, the carrots, cut lengthwise into about four pieces, the leeks, split lengthwise, the celery, the peppercorns, and the herbs.

Seasoning, said a very great cook, should be done with grace, and grace applies particularly to herbs. If you are an herb enthusiast, you will need no advice.
If the art is new to you, use only a slight pinch until you become more expert.
You may use all the herbs listed above, and more, or only part of them, but use herbs.
Tie them in a little bag, if your soup is not to be strained.

Soup - the Heart of the Meal

Now, you have a basic stock with which you can do many things. First, however, remove the excess fat and the vegetables which were meant only for seasoning.
You may strain the soup and place it in the refrigerator for later use, or you may use it at once.

For vegetable soup, cut your vegetables finely - carrots, potatoes, string beans, celery, turnips, Italian squash, or fresh peas. Cook them in the stock just long enough to make them tender.
Near the end of the cooking, add enough tomatoes, solid pack or juice, to suit your taste. You may also use a small can of tomato hot sauce.
A package of frozen mixed vegetables may be used, or a can of mixed vegetables.

Sometimes you may care to add a cup of finely shredded cabbage about five minutes before the soup is removed from the stove.

Tomato-Rice Soup (Serves 6-8)
Soup stock - 2-3 quarts
1 pint of tomatoes (juice or solid), enough to suit taste
1-2 cans of condensed tomato soup
1 cup uncooked rice
1 cup finely diced carrots
1/4 cup shredded parsley

Cook these together until the rice is thoroughly tender.
Serve this soup, which is a hearty one, in colorful soup bowls, along with celery sticks and French bread.

Tomato Soup with Pastes
To the plain stock, add tomato juice with any number of the soup pastes: alphabet letters, tiny stars, melon-seed pastes, or the tiny shell-like pastes, vermicelli, or spaghetti.
Add to this, or any other soup, leftover vegetable juices.

If you are still willing to experiment, try making brown stock. This is done by rendering out the bone marrow and browning the lean meat in it.
Dried lentils, such as split peas, beans, lima beans, and garbanzos (chick-peas) are also good cooked in the stock.

When the soup stock does not seem rich enough, don't be afraid to add bouillon cubes. Give the kettle plenty of salt and a farewell shake of pepper.

Clouds
Jeanette P.

Pany I love a wispy, chiffon cloud Wind-serried, soft, and white. In cobalt blue of sunset's glow That melts into the night. A flame-edged cloud at early dawn, Marking the new day's beam; Even a thunderous black one That hides a rainbow's gleam.

PATTERN

John M. Freckhton

In perfect understanding.
Peace,
And perfect growth
Of love prevail,
For giving thoroughly
In faith.
Engenders trust
That cannot fail.

SOMETHING IS GLAD

Dorothy J. Roberts

Something in the eager child is sad
And wise, and too all-knowing and resigned.
And something in the older heart is glad
In dreams, despite his unbelieving mind;
Something incorruptible and good,
Something of creator that conceives.
Some power captive in the restless blood
That shapes his far perfection and believes.
