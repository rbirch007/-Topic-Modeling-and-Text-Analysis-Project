John W. Young

George A. Smith

At the October conference of 1868, George A. Smith was sustained as first counselor to President Brigham Young, succeeding Heber C. Kimball. This selection brought to the First Presidency a man of unusual ability who had already proved his worth to the Church, and whose remaining seven years were to be given to supervisory functions in the Church.

George A. Smith was born in Potsdam, New York, on June 26, 1817. He was a son of John Smith and a first cousin of Joseph the Prophet. All of his family were Congregationalists but young George could not see that this form of Christianity agreed with the scriptures, so he remained aloof from all formally organized religious bodies.

About 1830 he heard of the Book of Mormon through his uncle, Joseph Smith, Sr., who visited his home. He was convinced that it was of divine origin and two years later, in September 1832, was baptized. Moving to Ohio, he was soon sent out as a missionary and until the exodus to the West, spent much of his time engaged in missionary work, traveling extensively in the eastern part of the United States.

He faithfully kept a diary and in it is recorded the vast amount of preaching he did. Before 1870 he had delivered 3800 gospel discourses.

After the migration into the Great Basin, Elder Smith became an outstanding pioneer leader. He was a robust man of unbounded energy and soon engaged in many activities that were necessary for the establishment of the new Zion. He led the colony that established Parowan in 1851 to establish the iron industry, and assisted in the general settlement of the southern part of the Territory.

He has appropriately been called the "Father of the Southern Settlements." So affectionately was he regarded in that area that the city of St. George was named in his honor.

Politically, he served as a territorial delegate to Congress at Washington, D.C., and assisted in forming the Provisional State of Deseret. He was a member of the territorial legislature in every session between 1850 and 1870, with the exception of one year spent in Congress.

LESSON DEPARTMENT John W. Young

When George A. Smith departed this life, the vacancy in the Presidency was filled by John W. Young, a son of Brigham Young.

This young man was born at Nauvoo in 1844 and was ordained an apostle by his father in 1864, but never became a member of the Council of the Twelve. He was interested in industrial pursuits, particularly in the construction and maintenance of railroads which in this era were beginning to enter the West.

In 1866 the plans for a railroad to the Pacific, with its possible arterial branches serving the intermountain territory, made it apparent that a new era was about to dawn upon the Church that would end the saints' economic, religious, and social isolation. The Church leaders planned branch roads to serve the various settlements, and were in need of competent advice.

Brigham Young chose his son John as a special counselor to him in this capacity in the late sixties, and in 1875 set him apart as his first counselor. He functioned in this capacity until his father's death in August 1877, after which for several years he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles.

He later moved to New York City where he engaged in railroad management.

Willard Richards

As Brigham Young was assisted by three first counselors during his administration, he similarly had the assistance of three second counselors. The first of these was Willard Richards, who was born in Massachusetts on June 24, 1804. His family were Congregationalists but Willard never formally joined any church.

He became a successful practicing physician and in the summer of 1835 saw a copy of the Book of Mormon which Brigham Young had left with his cousin near Boston. Willard read a portion of it and declared, "God or the devil has had a hand in that book, for man never wrote it."

He journeyed to Kirtland the next year and, in December 1836, was baptized. He accompanied Heber C. Kimball to open the British Mission in 1837 and remained there as one of its presidency until 1841, having the unique distinction of having been ordained an apostle in England in 1840.

At Nauvoo he was one of the outstanding men in its public life, holding the office of temple recorder, clerk of the Church, private secretary to Joseph Smith, clerk of the town council and clerk of the municipal court. He was with the Prophet in Carthage Jail when he was martyred.

Brigham Young chose him as his second counselor in December, 1847 and in that capacity he became the member of the Presidency who assumed much of the clerical and financial phases of Church administration. It was a great change from the calling of a New England physician to the duties he assumed in Salt Lake City. He was Secretary of State in the Provisional State of Deseret; a member of the territorial legislature; postmaster of Salt Lake City; manager of the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company; general Church Historian; and proprietor and editor of the Deseret News, the first newspaper in the intermountain area, which he established in 1850. His premature death in 1854 brought to a close a career that had.

Under the inspiration of God, given Brigham Young valuable help in organizing and administering the great migration of the saints to the West, and their organization into permanent groups to build the kingdom of Jedediah M. Grant.

The man whom Brigham Young selected to succeed Willard Richards was Jedediah M. Grant, a man very unlike his predecessor in office. Fi. Der Grant was born in Windsor, New York, February 21, 1816, and had joined the Church in 1833. During his early years in the Church he spent most of his time in missionary work and gained a reputation as a great gospel preacher and an unusually able scriptorian. He it was who opened the Southern States Mission of the Church.

In October 1847, he arrived in Salt Lake Valley. When the city was incorporated he was elected its first mayor, which position he continued to hold until his death. He was also a member of the territorial legislature. At the April conference in 1854, he was ordained an apostle and sustained as the second counselor to Brigham Young. For the next two and a half years his energies were spent in promoting what is commonly called "The Reformation." The saints had become so engrossed in their struggle to wrest their sustenance from the parched earth that some had seemed to forget that it was their religion that had been the cause of their going into the West. President Grant literally wore himself out physically, through his strenuous efforts to get the people to see the vital values in life. As a result of his efforts, there was a universal revival of spiritual life and energy, such as the saints had never before witnessed in the Church.

This calling of the people to repentance had a lasting effect upon the Church membership and resulted in a renewed interest in missionary work to the nations of the world. His early death—forty years of age—probably resulted from overwork in this cause. Coupled with his vigor and uncompromising battle against slothfulness and "backsliding" as he termed it, Jedediah M. Grant had a compassion for all who suffered. He died at Salt Lake City on December 1, 1856, nine days after the birth of his son, Heber J. Grant, who became the seventh President of the Church.

Daniel Hanmer Wells The third of Brigham Young's second counselors, was Daniel Hanmer Wells, who was born in Trenton, New York, October 27, 1814. In 1833 he had moved to Commerce (later Nauvoo), where he was a large landholder and prominent in civic affairs. He dealt kindly with the saints who had been driven from Missouri, and although not a member of the Church, was treated as one of their number and was elected to the office of town councilman and appointed a brigadier-general in the Nauvoo Legion. When the saints were forced to leave Nauvoo he decided to cast his lot with them, although had he remained he undoubtedly would have become wealthy from the spoils of their labors. His baptism took place in Nauvoo in 1846. He arrived in Utah in 1848.

There he became active in the territorial militia, taking part in the campaigns against the Indians with marked success, and carrying to a successful conclusion the "bloodless war" with Johnston's Army in 1857 and 1858. On being ordained an apostle and set apart as second counselor to Brigham Young, January 4, 1857, he took over the supervision of public works, an essential portion of the economy of the Church, which provided employment for the immigrants during the adjustment period between their arrival in the Valley and the beginning of their agricultural or manufacturing pursuits. He likewise visited the many settlements of the saints and in 1876 visited the newly founded colonies of saints in Arizona, giving them counsel and inspirational advice.

The death of Brigham Young released him from his office, but he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles. In this capacity he served as president of the European Missions and ended his days as president of the Manti temple. He died March 24, 1891.

Topics for Discussion 1.

What evidence can you present to show that God inspired Brigham Young to choose his counselors because the Church had need for the talents they possessed? 

2. What evidence can you find that these men grew, under the power of their calling, to meet the needs of the Church and its members?

3. What do you suppose caused Willard Richards to make the remark he did about the Book of Mormon when he first commenced to read it?

4. How do you account for the fact that so many of the early Church leaders were converted to the restored gospel by the Book of Mormon, even before they had seen Joseph Smith?

5. Read the two accounts of Jedediah M. Grant's preaching in the Southern States, as given on pages 59 and 60 of 791 Jenson's L.D.S. Biographical Encyclopedia.

She began writing while attending Brigham Young University. Her literary work is distinguished by clarity and beauty of language and a deep insight into character and personality. Many of our readers will recall with pleasure her delightful pioneer poem "To My Mother" which was awarded first honorable mention in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest in 1936.
Mrs. Clark and her husband have been active leaders in several wards and branches of the Church — including Mesa (Arizona), Albuquerque (New Mexico), and El Paso (Texas), where they have welcomed many missionaries and converts to the Church.

You may be interested to know that I visited several of the families that I have been sending the Magazine to. They are all non-members, and each one praised the Magazine very highly, saying they passed it on to friends and relatives when they had finished reading it. It was the means of a good many interesting gospel conversations.
Una McDonald, Las Vegas, Nevada.

"The Visitors" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) is a fascinating story. It reveals unusual ability to portray human behavior patterns truthfully and entertainingly. To my delight I find no flaws in her portrayals, no confusion of traits, not one tiny slip out of character, and I knew intimately the two dear women she describes so charmingly.
I predict for Mrs. Tarlock a brilliant career in the realm of homey stories.
Estelle Neff Caldwell, Los Angeles, California.

The sisters here in Glasgow (Scotland) appreciate the Relief Society Magazine and send their best wishes for its continued success.

The current feature in the Relief Society Magazine, "The Russells Did Not Go to Church," (August, September, and October) is unusually good.
