NOVEMBER NOON Christie Lund Coles

The cornstalks now lie frayed upon the ground;
The sunflower faces, gaunt upon their stems,
Are stripped of foliage; silenced is the sound
Of the stream that splashed its brightly gleaming gems
Upon the bending salt grass on the shore,
Accompanying birds through every summer tune
That now is silenced, too, muted before
The barn sparrow's forlorn peep this autumn noon.

The fields, heat-seared and fallow, lie untilled
And scarred of breast; the monotonous chirp
Of crickets in the grass foretells the chilled
And lonely winter days that will usurp
The autumn now beyond this desolation.... 
What strength earth manifests in resignation.

Joy in Full Measure

President Belle S. Spafford (Address delivered at the morning session of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, September 30, 1948)

THIS is indeed a glorious and history-making day in the life of Relief Society. It is a day that has been anxiously anticipated and one that will be long remembered—a day of rejoicing and thanksgiving.

Today we remember the thousands of our sisters throughout the world whom circumstances prevent being with us on this important occasion, but whose hearts and prayers are with us—sisters in faraway Finland, Lebanon, Syria, the isles of the sea, South Africa, Old Mexico, and elsewhere—women whose devotion to Relief Society and whose contributions to this fund-raising program have helped to make this occasion possible.

My heart reaches out in love and gratitude to Relief Society women the world over for their wonderful response to this great fund-raising program. Relief Society women today are heirs of a great heritage. They have proved themselves worthy of that heritage, demonstrating in their characters the same sterling qualities possessed by the women who have gone before them—faith, devotion to duty, willingness to unselfishly labor and sacrifice that this society might go forward. They have upheld a wonderful tradition and justified the confidence placed in them by the First Presidency, who, when authorizing us to launch the fund-raising program, said: "We have never known the sisters to fail in anything they have undertaken in the past and we feel sure they will not fail in this."

I am confident that those who have gone before us are today rejoicing with us, for this building program is not ours alone; it belongs to the past and it will belong to the future. In this magnificent achievement the women of this day have kept faith with the noble women of the past by opening the way whereby their dream may be brought to fruition. They have nobly and generously fulfilled the great special assignment given to the women of this day, making possible a lasting memorial to the women of this Church. They have set a worthy pattern of loyalty and obedience for Relief Society women of the future, and those who follow after them will remember their efforts and bless them for what they have done.

We stand humbled at the magnitude of what has been accomplished. One year ago when the fund-raising program was launched we recognized it to be an enormous undertaking. Its greatness has in no measure diminished as the year has passed. In fact, as we view it today it assumes even greater proportions than we judged it for a year ago.

The Lord has blessed our efforts, however, unto a full measure of success and we acknowledge his goodness unto us. His spirit has rested upon Relief Society women in all parts of the world, touching their hearts and causing them to want to do their part of this program. Relief Society officers have evidenced superb leadership, secretaries have faithfully and accurately kept record of contributions. Visiting teachers have loyally carried the program into the homes. Relief Society members with generous hearts have given to it their full support. Our appreciation for all that the sisters have done is unbounded. We acknowledge the support and co-operation of the Priesthood authorities: the First Presidency, members of the Council of the Twelve, the Presiding Bishopric—and other General Authorities, the brethren of the General Church Welfare Committee, as well as stake and ward, mission and branch Priesthood authorities. All have rallied to our cause and strengthened our hands.

Only those who have been closely identified with the work incident to the planning and conduct of the program as it has been carried forward in the general office can fully appreciate the great responsibility carried by Sister Marianne Sharp as chairman. The wisdom and judgment required, the ability to anticipate and satisfactorily deal with questions and problems related to the program, the capacity to keep track of numberless details, and the tireless efforts necessary in taking care of limitless and incessant correspondence are beyond description. Yet Sister Sharp has fulfilled all of these requirements with efficiency and with the true spirit of service, in no way being stampeded by the pressures. Sister Sharp has been assisted by a committee of general board members composed of the following sisters: Velma N. Simonsen, Edith S. Elliott, Evon W. Peterson, Mary J. Wilson, and Leone G. Layton. These sisters have been loyal, meeting every requirement made of them throughout the past year.

THE program has been conducted in a dignified manner in keeping with the high standards of the society. Ideals have determined its purposes, and ideals have directed our practices. Sentiment has entered into it, giving depth of feeling and warmth of heart to the program. This achievement represents great monetary value, but not monetary value alone. Herein are represented many intangible values—values of supreme worth—appreciation for the honored position accorded women in the gospel plan; testimony of the divinity of the work of the society; and gratitude for the opportunity given the sisters of the Church to serve through their own great Relief Society; loyalty to leadership; unselfish devotion to a great cause. It is a reflection of the greatness that is inherent within the society.

The achievement represents deep-seated and tender emotions—the love of a daughter for her mother or grandmother; the love of a mother for her daughter; respect and devotion for a friend; the desire to memorialize a loved one whose memory is revered; the wish to reach out and include as a part of this wonderful sisterhood a dear one who may not have availed herself of this blessing.

The dollars which make up the fund represent individual contributions of many types: the providently saved nickels and dimes of sisters to whom these savings meant much; the Christmas gift of one sister, long anticipated in order that some little personal need might be met; the golden wedding gift of another, cherished because a loved one had given it to her; the gift of an aged sister, who, in passing away a few days after making her contribution, rejoiced that she had lived long enough to see this program launched and to participate in it; the young sister not yet old enough to be a Relief Society member, but looking forward to the time when this privilege would be hers. These dollars represent money earned by individual sisters through the labor of their hands—the aprons made, cakes baked and sold; they represent evenings spent in caring for a baby, or days spent in domestic service.
These dollars represent group earnings—earnings which challenged the resourcefulness and ingenuity of the sisters and made heavy demands upon their time and energies—earnings which required hours of hard work. Irrespective of how they were acquired, however, all are an expression of love and appreciation for Relief Society and a willingness to do that which is required for the good of the society.
Just as all of our righteous efforts return to bless us and make us glad, so will the efforts of Relief Society women in meeting this great present-day assignment return to bless them and bring to them joy in full measure. They may experience the satisfaction that comes from a task well done. They may feel assured of the approbation of our Heavenly Father. They may enjoy that deep sense of happiness and contentment that comes from doing one's part in a great and worthy cause. They may be comforted in the knowledge that they have glorified the day in which they have lived and served our beloved society.
My earnest prayer is that the blessings of the Lord will continue with you. May He abundantly bless all those entrusted with responsibility in this program from this time forth. May vision, wisdom, and judgment accompany every step in the planning of the building. May intelligence, honesty, and skill be the constant guides of those who shall labor in its erection. May those who shall administer this sacred fund make sure that each dollar expended is spent wisely and well; may they never lose sight of the manner in which these dollars were accumulated nor the lofty motives that prompted their giving.
May all future efforts be accompanied by the same measure of success and the same degree of joy and satisfaction which we feel today. And, in the words of Sister Blomquist of the Swedish Mission, "when the building is finished may joy and happiness, knowledge and truth, love and charity flow from within its walls to the whole world."
BRAVE HEARTS
Evelyn Fjeldsted

The hopefulness and cheerfulness of brave hearts everywhere—resolved to carry on against great odds—result, at length, in problems solved.
And what of the Promise? Counselor Marianne C. Sharp (Address delivered at the morning session of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, September 30, 1948)

Sister Spafford has asked me, as chairman of the Relief Society Building Fund Committee, to give a report on the Building Fund. You sisters who are here today, representing the more than 111,000 Relief Society members throughout the world, have come rejoicing to commemorate the conclusion of the fund-raising program to erect a Relief Society Building. Just a year ago lacking two days, the Relief Society sisters assembled at the 1947 annual general Relief Society conference voted to raise a vast sum of money for the purpose of erecting a Relief Society building. You will recall that the plan provided that all Relief Society stake boards donate one half of their stake board funds on hand as of December 1946, and that every stake, in addition, be responsible for $5 for every enrolled member as of December 1946. Provision was also made to have Relief Society members and friends donate Special and Memorial Gifts, as they might desire, and the missions of the Church, except the European missions, were invited to take part in the financing program according to quotas to be set by their respective Relief Society mission presidents in consultation with the mission presidents. It was hoped that these amounts, when added together, would make up a grand total of $500,000 or half a million.
To raise such a vast sum of money in one year was an undertaking which to some seemed well-nigh impossible and to others not even advisable. But the program had the full approval of the First Presidency, and right after the October conference the funds began slowly to come in. To reach the true objective it was not only necessary that the money be raised, but it was essential that the giving be done in a spirit of love so that blessings might be poured out upon the sisters. From the expressions which have accompanied the remittances, it seems certain that the sisters throughout the world have earned the blessings of the Lord and that they have been bound together in closer bonds of sisterhood.
As one sister wrote who lived far away from any organized Relief Society: "In my heart the quota would never be complete if my share was missing."
There have been numberless Memorial Gifts made to honor dear, faithful Relief Society workers of both the past and present. Recently the Florida Stake Relief Society expressed the spirit of the Memorial Gifts when they wrote:
This money is to be applied as a Memorial offering to honor our beloved leaders, Brother and Sister Charles A. Callis. It is a pleasure for us to do this as we feel that our roll could never be complete without its being headed by the names of two of our leaders who have given of themselves so unselfishly to the building up of the Father's kingdom in Page 727 the South.
We know that the lives of these two people stand as a living memorial and will always be indelible on the minds of the people of the South. Truly the spirit of this undertaking has been pleasing to our Father in heaven.

We report to you now the expenses which have been incurred to date incident to raising the money. All figures used throughout will be in even dollars.
Postage $156
Stationery 27
Printing 758
Financial Clerk 75
Inscription on Certificates 234
Foreign Exchange 148
Total $2,058

Before the beginning of the fundraising, it was the earnest desire of the general board that it might provide some revenue to meet such necessary expenses. A few years ago one of the General Authorities wrote a series of articles for The Relief Society Magazine. Later the general board desired to issue the articles in book form as a reference. He consented but requested that the royalties go to Relief Society. The earnings were earmarked to meet any necessary expenses incidental to raising the Building Fund.

When the entire edition is sold, the royalties will be sufficient to meet all the expenses just reported. We know you likewise are happy that each dollar you contribute will go into the building. WE feel very humble and at the same time very proud to report now the amount of money which you and thousands of sisters whom you represent have raised to erect a Relief Society Building. 

We know that long hours and arduous toil have been necessary to accomplish the achievement you have made. The stake board quota of $35,483 has been paid in full, and it is with deep gratitude that we report that every stake in the Church has been recognized here today. Contribution quotas "of stakes amounting to $443,885 have been paid, and in addition Special and Memorial Gifts amounting to $10,028 making a grand total from the stakes of the Church of $449,396. 

Ere and Memorial Gifts made directly to the general board have ranged from gifts of $1 to one gift of $10,000, and from these gifts has come an additional sum of $12,482. Our hearts have been continually touched by the spirit of the sisters in the missions. From those who have no places of their own in which to meet, no chairs even on which to sit, no tables at which to work, has come an outpouring of offerings which made us who have plenty feel humble indeed.

We are proud to report that the money contributed by the sisters of $43,927 has been advised by the Presiding Bishopric that the amount of money �$8,000�which Relief Society sisters years ago donated to erect a woman's building, is being turned to Relief Society. For this we are indeed grateful, for now the money raised by those dear sisters of long ago will really become stone and mortar in the building for which they worked and dreamed.

728 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�NOVEMBER 1948

AND WHAT OF THE PROMISE?

Our hearts rejoice to give now the grand total of money given to the Relief Society Building Fund, an amount of $554,516. 

WITH deepest gratitude and thanksgiving we report that the First Presidency have informed us that they will give to us a site on which to erect the building, and that the choosing of the proper site is under consideration at the present time. They have assured us that they want us to have the right neighbors and ample space for our beautiful building. They have instructed Sister Spafford to go ahead at once to perfect our building plans, as they feel that the Relief Society Building is urgently needed. As soon as the First Presidency designate the site you may be sure the general board will at once inform you, and it is our earnest expectation that before too long you will be able to enter the building which you will have made possible.

The generosity of the General Authorities to the women of the Church I am sure brings joy to your hearts as it does to the hearts of the general board members. 

In contemplating the work of Relief Society we always praise and emulate the work of the sisters of the past. In viewing this stupendous accomplishment of Relief Society today, I feel certain that the sisters of the future have been given just cause to admire and emulate your example.

I feel that once again, as over the years, the sisters have demonstrated their love and their faithfulness and are worthy to have been given by divine revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith that greatest blessing the Relief Society�through which the sisters of the Church render service to the Church and make individual progress on the eternal path to the celestial kingdom.

One year ago President Spafford said to us, "We must not fail." With thanksgiving we say to her at this time, we have not failed, but have succeeded gloriously beyond our greatest expectations. You have been the instruments by which that great dream of the women of the past will become reality. Through your unselfish giving the dream of the past has become the sure promise of the morrow. For your vision and faithfulness I pray that the blessings of our Heavenly Father may continue to be poured out upon you and on all other Relief Society sisters found over the world this day.

THE BUILDING FUND

Nellie W. Neal
I can't think all the building will be in wood and stone,
When we erect the edifice we've come to call our own,
Because, as I've been giving to help attain our goal,
I've felt a growth within myself, expanding heart and soul.

Relief Society Building News

SUCH wonderful support has been given by Relief Societies of foreign missions of the Church to the fund-raising program to erect a Relief Society Building that the general board wishes to share with the readers of the Magazine a few of their expressions of joy and thankfulness at being permitted to have a part in this great Relief Society cause. The following excerpts are typical of the many expressions that have been received:

Every month, we read in The Relief Society Magazine of the wonderful response you are getting in your Building Fund.
Here in Australia, almost every branch wants to participate in that movement and is collecting funds for that purpose.
I hope that the Lord will bless those who have this project in charge.
May success crown your efforts.

Blanche K. Richmond, President, Australian Mission Relief Society

Please find enclosed the contribution of the Canadian Mission Relief Society toward the Relief Society Building.
We are so happy the Relief Society is going to have its own building.

LaPriel R. Eyre, President, Canadian Mission Relief Society

Until this year conditions have been such that we have hesitated to call on the sisters for anything extra.
But now things look brighter and the sisters are delighted with the opportunity given them to join with the women of the Church in this project.
We are giving each sister the opportunity to contribute what she can, and, in addition, the branches are all planning ways of increasing the fund.

Kate M. Barker, President, French Mission Relief Society

Enclosed you will find our check.
Please credit this amount to the Relief Society of the Mexican Mission as a donation to the Relief Society Building Fund.
Even though the amount is very small, yet the effort made by these sisters ls evidence of their faith and their desire to do something to help.

Mary D. Pierce, President, Mexican Mission Relief Society

Aloha to you and to the members of the general board from the Land of Flowers and liquid sunshine.
Enclosed you will find a check as a contribution from the Central Pacific Mission Relief Society for the Relief Society Building.
Although this amount is small in comparison to most of the checks you receive for this purpose, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I send this contribution from our Relief Society.

Although all of our members are very young, they are very desirous to do their part with the other Relief Society sisters of the Church.
I sincerely hope and pray that your aim will be fully realized in collecting the necessary amount for the Relief Society Building,
and also that our Father in heaven will continue to bless you in your untiring efforts for the education and betterment of the women of the Church.

Georgia H. Weenig, President, Central Pacific Mission Relief Society

The Relief Societies of the South African Mission are very pleased to join the Relief Societies of the Church in doing their part toward the Relief Society Building Fund.
It gives us great pleasure to be able to do this and we send our blessings for your success in this great undertaking.

Ida G. Sharp, President, South African Mission Relief Society

I have waited until now hoping to get our Relief Society organized.
Since the campaign on the Building Fund is drawing to a close, we want our Uruguayan Mission to have the opportunity of making a contribution.
With sincere appreciation for the Magazine and other fine help which we receive from the general board,
and with a prayer for your continued success and happiness in your work, I am,

Corraine S. Williams, President, Uruguayan Mission Relief Society

We, the undersigned, members of the Relief Society in the Swedish Mission, are grateful and happy to be able to do our little bit towards the construction of the new Relief Society Building,
a wonderful monument to the women of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
May our Father in Heaven bless the planning and erection of this building,
so that when it is finished, joy and happiness, knowledge and truth, love and charity may flow from within its walls to the whole world.

It has been a pleasure to see how the sisters here have rallied to the call,
and how happy they have been in so doing.
They were all delighted to think of having their names placed, with all the others, in the cornerstone of the new building. 

Ethel E.

Blomquist, President, Swedish Mission Relief Society

Seasoning Margery S. Stewart snowy plains of Wyoming. John Fenton leaned against the window, staring unseeingly at the endless wastes. How could a returning missionary not look like a returning missionary? He fished in his pocket for Susan's letter. He held it in his hands but did not read it. He knew it off by heart.

The train fled through the Darling, I've planned this Thanksgiving. It has to be. I've asked all my friends from school and some of yours, don't come home all stirred up about things. I just want to love you and some of them just don't understand. John grinned at Clara Wells, who sat opposite him. She was returning from her mission in the Eastern States.

"How do returning missionaries look, Sister Wells?" he demanded.

Clara Wells looked at the letter in his hand. "So that's what she said. Well... How do I look?"

"Nice," John said thoughtfully, "and sort of shining."

"Do I?" She nodded her smooth brown head. "Well, I've had enough experiences in the last two years to keep me shining for a lifetime." She looked at him critically. "You look very nice, too, tall and dark, and purposeful... And something else, indefinable. Don't let the world rob you of it."

The porter came through calling, "Rock Springs... Rock Springs, five minutes 'Home?' Clara's voice wavered.

On her coat. Have to look after Maury McClaughlin from now on." "Maury McClaughlin!" John demanded. "That wild Scot?" Clara laughed. "I know she's been a handful. But it's that impulsive Curiosity of hers. She couldn't help getting lost in Chicago. After all the things you were up against in the British Mission, you ought to be able to handle a seventeen-year-old youngster," "But she's not just any youngster," John stated flatly. "I can't do it."

"You have to do it," Clara pointed out reasonably. "You're the only missionary left. It's just a few hours to Salt Lake. Her aunt will be at the station." The door was flung open at the back of the car.

"Sister Wells," a clear voice shrieked. "Your station it is," John pulled his neck into his collar as the quick footsteps rushed down the aisle, Maury McClaughlin brushed past him and flung herself into Clara's arms. "Oh, it's lost I will be with you gone! Not to see your bonny face or hear your voice!" Maury's own voice rose despairingly.

John Fenton's mouth twitched as he watched the girl burrow her face into Clara's shoulder. Maury's bright red hair shimmered like silk. She was a tall girl and very slender. She lifted her face.

Her eyes were a deep, gemlike blue. She owned the freckled skin of the red-haired. Her gestures were dramatic and sincere and terribly young. "You've been an angel to me, that you have!" Maury possessed a radiance that made John feel he was in the path of a prairie fire.

Clara kissed Maury. "You have a big job ahead of you, dear, making a home and a place for your mother and father and your small sisters. But you can do it. You'll have them with you in no time at all. I only wish I could be close enough to help."

"But you've been so good to me!" Maury wailed. "And I've been a grief to you. That I have."

"Nonsense." Clara reached for her bags. "Now you stay close to Elder Fenton and don't leave his side at any station." "Aye, that I won't," vowed Maury passionately. She turned to John. "I promise with my hand on my heart not to give you a moment's worry."

John bit back the chuckle. He knotted his brows firmly. "You'll not be getting off at any station. Own sister to understand?" She asked reluctantly, "Not even if I see an Indian?"

"No," said John, "and please don't scream when you see another cowboy. It's...

It's embarrassing." They stood on the train platform and watched Clara step into the circle of joyous friends and relatives, who hugged her furiously one after another, their faces wet with tears. Clara waved her hand at John and Maury as the train pulled away. He put his arms around an elderly, gray-haired woman, who made him think of his own mother. The train gathered speed. John felt a wild tug of homesickness. He wanted to get off and push the cars. They seemed to move with such deliberate pace. Maury pulled at his sleeve. "We'd better go." "Of whom do you think when you look like that?" "Someone very nice?" "The nicest," John agreed. "I'm just hoping she won't have changed her mind about me. I was mighty lucky to get her." For an instant, the light seemed to vanish from Maury's face, but she slid into the seat beside him and folded her hands demurely on her lap. "Susan Meredith, isn't it? Sister Wells told me you are engaged to marry her," John Fenton stared ahead. He saw Susan's small, delicate face, her dark curling hair, her competent, assured manner. Susan knew exactly what she wanted from life. He still found it hard to believe that she had included him in her plans, that she was willing to marry him when she could have so many others. "There was a small rustling beside him. John turned. Maury was sitting quietly, her hands in her lap, her eyes on his face. "Is it so large then, the city?" she asked. "You recall MacBrogan town. I shall be quite lost in a large place," 740 John grinned ruefully, recalling the Chicago episode. "I think I should warn the city fathers that you're coming." He sobered. "But I do remember MacBrogan town, the good times we had there. I remember the first night we came, two missionaries cold, hungry, and tired, and how your father took us in and fed us and listened to us." Maury's eyes grew large and brilliant. "Always it was so. The best for the poor who had no roof or cover. That was my father all his life long." "He's a wonderful man," John patted her hand. "It won't be long. You'll get a fine job and work and save, and your family will be saving too, and then you'll be together, perhaps next Thanksgiving." She smoothed the darned place in her plaid skirt. "Tell me then about this Thanksgiving. I don't understand." John chuckled. "It's a wonderful day. Everybody gets a turkey or goose and calls in all the relatives and friends. Why, in St. George the women start getting ready two weeks ahead." He took a deep breath. "Gosh! I can almost smell the dinner now, mince and apple pies, turkey browning." Maury sighed in wonder and delight. She slid down in the seat. "So many days for just fun here in America. I love it. In the war we were so often hungry, never until on the Queen Mary was I full—here." She pressed thin hands over her stomach. John Fenton felt a quick pity, remembering the pinched faces of the people he had left behind, their austere tables, their uncomplaining relief society. But he gunned down on her, remembering. "I'll never forget the look on the waiter's face when he saw you stow away your third breakfast on that ship. I think you set a record." He laughed at her quick blush. "Never mind, your aunt will no doubt have a marvelous meal waiting, then you'll find out about Thanksgiving." But her white hands pressed in as though the pain persisted still. "Where will you be, Elder Fenton?" "With Susan. She promised me a fabulous dinner. Then my brother is driving up to take me down to St. George, and I'll have another celebration," "Will Susan go with you?" He shook his head. "She goes to the University. There are so many things going on at Thanksgiving parties... She may come later," "She must be very beautiful?" "She is!" She smoothed her cheek. "Would—would anyone find me... fair?" John regarded her critically, "There are a lot of men who really like red hair. Oh, you'll get married all right to a fine young man, no doubt." Her small face tightened. Her lower lip quivered. "That I'll not!" she said tartly and rose. She tossed her flaming hair, "I shall stay unmarried forever and ever, aye, that I will." Now what was wrong with her? John turned to watch her swinging, determined stride down the aisle. Suddenly, in spite of her height, she seemed very small and alone, an alien in a strange land. The porter came. "A telegram for Miss McClaughlin, Sir." SEASONING
741
'I'll take it," John went in search of her. He found her two cars down, the center of an admiring group who pleaded for more details of her beloved Scotland. "A telegram?" She rose to her feet and followed him back to their car. "Now who would be spending of their good money?" John coughed to hide his laughter. "Open it and see." She obeyed him. Her eyes flashed across the lines. "Ah, 'tis not as bad as I feared." John took the extended telegram. It was from her aunt. Sorry. Will not be at station. Neil sick in San Francisco. Key in mail box. Love, Aunt Nora. "I'm sorry," John handed the telegram back. Compassion shook him, remembering her parting from her loved ones, the lonely journey. She should be welcomed with banners and drums. Suddenly, he turned. Of course! She could come along to Susan's dinner. It would take the edge off the loneliness. He started to tell her. No. He would ask Susan to ask her. That would make the invitation warmer, more welcoming. The hours inched away. John's impatience mounted with every mile. Maury sat beside him, pale and still with excitement. The early dusk had settled and the lights had been turned on. In their glow her hair gleamed like bright gold. John thought of the moors she had left behind, the little cottage that housed her warm, friendly family. He found himself saying a prayer for her, silently, that she would find joy in the city for which she had sacrificed so much. At last, after incredible waiting, the porter came through, calling, "Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City . . ." John drank in the name. His heart seemed to crowd in his throat, making it difficult to breathe. Maury jumped to her feet. "Did you hear, Elder Fenton! Salt Lake City, the man said. It's here! It's really here!" She reached for her shabby green coat. "Oh, if only I had someone of my own. Someone to share this moment. It is the greatest of my life. I know it." John handed her hat to her. She surveyed it ruefully. "I'm afraid I don't look very grand." John looked down at her flushed, shining face, her brilliant eyes. His heart climbed back in his throat. He grinned. "With that hair you couldn't look any way but grand. Queen's color.

That's what my mother calls it. We're stopping! He went before her down the aisle, but so many people were ahead of him that he was stalled to one impatient step at a time. He looked through the windows. Suddenly he saw Susan, standing in the center of a group of friends. Her thin face was rosy with cold and excitement. She looked very smart in her beaver coat with the brown hat to match. Her dark hair had been cut short. It curled around her face. John recognized one or two of the group around her, girls he had known from the University. Gladness welled up in him until he could hardly bear the weight of it. Maury stumbled against him. "Just wait until you meet them," he told her. "You'll feel as much at home as if you sat on a moor." At last the crowd thinned. I stepped down. Susan ran to him, hands outstretched. "John, darling! How handsome you look." She flung back her head for his kiss. "Come and meet everyone. Mother put dinner at nine so you'll have plenty of time to make an impression." John laughed at her flow of words. "Susan, you haven't changed either. Bossing me around just like always." He kissed her again and put his arm around her while she made the introductions. He shook hands with them all. His eyes searched theirs. It was a habit he had acquired in the mission field. In all of them he found the blank, uncomprehending stare of the stranger. "What a lovely place!" Even the smoke-grimed platform and the black, ugly gates had the beauty of familiarity. Susan laughed. "Now you do sound just like a missionary. Oh, John, it's been hideous with you gone. I want to catch up on all the fun we've missed." She stopped short. "John? That girl? She keeps looking at you?" Contrition seized him. Maury. He had forgotten her. He turned. Maury was standing some distance away, a slim, waiting figure, something patient and forlorn about her. John took Susan's arm. "Come and meet her. She's a convert from Scotland. Darling, would you do me a favor and ask her to your dinner?" He stumbled over words in his haste to tell of the aunt who could not come, of Maury's family in Scotland. Susan drew back, impatience on her pretty face. "John! I couldn't possibly ask her! Mother has RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE NOVEMBER 1948 stretched the table to its last inch. It would ruin the decorations." "But Susan, we just have to ask her. This is her first night in this place. She hasn't a soul. It's Thanksgiving. Please, Susan, for me?" Susan shook her head. "John, you'll never learn. Things just aren't done that way. I'll ask her some other time. We'll put her in a cab. You'll see, she will be perfectly all right." Maury looked up and saw them coming toward her. John winced away from the blinding relief in her smile. He turned to Susan. "I can't just put her in a cab. That's what we did in Chicago. That's why we missed our train. Ten missionaries spent a day looking for her." "Where on earth was she?" "The cab driver's wife was having a baby, no one to help her take care of the children. Maury thought it would just take an hour or so to help out, and stayed eighteen hours." "Good heavens!" Susan's lip curled. "Where do you find your friends?" John said stubbornly, "I don't have time to argue now. You take your friends and go on back to the house. I'll see that Maury gets to her aunt's house in one piece." He introduced the two girls. He felt an instant's wonder. It must be Maury's bright hair, but something about her made Susan seem small and drab and meager. "I'm going to take you home," he explained to Maury. She looked from him to Susan. "Oh, but the dinner, Elder Fenton. I couldna' take you away." Susan smiled widely. "It's all tight, Miss McClaughlin. He can come later, Goodbye now, John." "Well... If you're verry sure..." Maury's Scotch burr was never more in evidence. John reached for her bags. Watched the others leave, now let's find a cab." A cab whisked away just as they reached the street. They hesitated. Maury looked about her. She took a deep breath, "Is the city then so near?" "Just a few minutes walk," John assured her, "Would you...," she swallowed, "would you spare the time? I could come for my bags tomorrow, have such a hunger, here." She pressed her hands over her breast, "I have a hunger to see it all... The Temple... The Eagle Gate." The passionate longing in her voice made a lump rise in John's throat. "Of course we will. Wait here a moment." The Temple grounds were closed. They peered through the gates. The floodlights made a shower of gold on the stay stones. Moroni stood in golden relief against the dark blue of the night sky. Maury's face, he whispered, "It's better than I dreamed," John said huskily, "It's better than I remembered." They walked to the Eagle Gate and back, to stop and stare like any pair of tourists at the Lion House 743 the statue of Brigham Young, the dazzling beauty of Main Street after dark. John found that he had been walking for a long time. "Gosh, girl! You're hungry!" "That I am!" The cafe was small, cheerful, and bright. John studied the menu. "Turkey, of course?" "Turkey?" she lifted inquiring brows, "Every true American has to have a slice of turkey inside him. On Thanksgiving day," She sighed and slipped out of her shabby green coat. "Oh, this wonderful America. I think this day was made for me. A Thanksgiving day and my own heart so full it can hardly lift her eyes to his. Just think what I have to be thankful for this day... The missionaries coming... My father urging us all to listen. Something new and strange and beautiful coming into our lives... and now, look at me here!" She sat up taller. "A Latter-day Saint in the Promised Land." John looked at her for a long moment and pieces of a puzzle fell into place. There was something in her sick and sure and unashamed that made his own heart home shine before him in all their hard work and struggle and triumph. Don't let the world Tob you, Sister Wells had said. (Continued on page 759) "For THE Rights OF THE Women OF Zion AND THF Rights OF THE WOMEN oF ALL Nations."

A few pictures, a little pains taken to make
the furniture look bright and new, and above everything else rooms kept neat and tidy.
Plenty of sunshine and fresh air makes a house wholesome and the inmates better
natured. Let the children enjoy the parlor as well as the grown people. Never shut
the children out from any place because it is too good for them; they will be more
refined and cultured if they are taught how to handle things that are valuable and
pretty, than if they are always denied the pleasure. Childhood's hours pass quickly
enough, and the cares and perplexities of life bring about many changes in one's feelings
and circumstances, therefore it seems wise and prudent to fortify our children by a
generous supply of good nature, and help them to cultivate all the higher and holier
attributes of the mind. � ^Aunt Em.

ONEIDA STAKE: The Relief Society of the Oneida Stake held their annual
conference at Franklin, Sept. 9, 1888, Pres. Elizabeth Fox presiding. Sister Richards
felt to exhort us to lay aside all pride, "and train the minds of our children; not spend
so much time in adorning their body, but adorn their minds with truth and virtue and
they will bless you in your old age; cherish charity, and learn forgiveness to all men and
the Lord will forgive whom he will. It is the duty of the Relief Society to administer
to the needs of the poor." � Annie Hatch, Sec.

MISCELLANEOUS: Thought engenders thought. Place one idea on paper, another
will follow it, and still another, until you have written a page. You cannot fathom
your mind. There is a well of thought there which has no bottom. The more you
draw from it, the more clear and fruitful will it be. If you neglect to think for yourself
and use other people's thoughts, giving them utterance only, you will never know
what you are capable of. At first your ideas may come out in lumps, homely and shapeless;
but no matter; time and perseverance will arrange and polish them. Learn to think
and you will learn to write; the more you think, the better you will express your ideas.

THANKSGIVING Day inevitably turns our thoughts backward to the sturdy character of our Pilgrim Fathers. They are literally the forefathers of many Latter-day Saint men and women, as was remarked by a noted genealogist visiting in Salt Lake City some years ago. The Rich family, who have contributed much to the strength of the Church, are descendants of the Captain Rich who owned and piloted the Mayflower on the voyage when it carried the first Pilgrims to American shores.

THE Olympic Games indicate that Fanny Blankers-Koen, thirty, a Dutch mother and housewife, is the world's greatest woman athlete. She easily won four first places in the games: the eighty-meter women's hurdles, in which she established a new world record of eleven and two-tenths seconds; the 100-meter and 200-meter women's sprints; and the anchor in the 400-meter women's relay. She already holds the world record for the women's broad jump, for which she could not compete this time as it was held at the same time as one of the events in which she was contending. Had she won this in the Games, she would have been the only known athlete since the dawn of the Olympic Games to win five first places.

Our American, Babe Didrikson, won enormous prestige for taking two first places and one second in the 1936 Olympics.

WILHELMINA, now self-titled dowager princess of the Netherlands, abdicated the throne of the Netherlands and the Dutch Empire September 4, in favor of her daughter Juliana. It was Wilhelmina's sixty-eighth birthday and the fiftieth anniversary of her coronation. Her reign has been marked by thrift, simplicity, a close relationship with her people, which was a distinct royal innovation, a shrewd insight into affairs of state, and the courage to follow the path she believed right, and in some cases humane, in the face of general opposition. She is the sole survivor of seventeen monarchs contemporary with her first days as queen. Five only wore their crowns until their deaths.

Wilhelmina's hobbies have been bicycling, skating, horseback riding, walking in the woods, and painting. Two days after her mother's abdication, Juliana became queen of the Netherlands at an investiture service at Niewe Kerk, the church being now connected with the royal palace. Juliana is the mother of four daughters.

THANKSGIVING for Riches of the Spirit
Thanksgiving Day, Latter-day Saints will gather with their
loved ones around tables loaded
with an abundance of food. Crisp
stalks of celery will gleam among
dark-skinned olives; savory dressing
will be spooned out of the golden
turkey; mounds of mashed potatoes
hidden under a yellow coating of
butter will vie with tender green
peas and bright red pickled beets to
make a kaleidoscope of colors against
the heavy linen damask highlighted
with crystal and silver. Each member
of the family will reverently bow
his head and with grateful heart return
thanks to his Father in heaven
for the multiplicity of material blessings
he enjoys. There may come
also into his mind's eye, in contrast,
a picture of a humble pioneer home
where food was scarce, table linen
and eating utensils of the rudest,
and luxuries nonexistent. And at
the contrast again there may arise
in the breast of the present-day
saint an upwelling of gratitude for
conveniences and luxuries enjoyed
by him.

Too often in considering the lot
of the saints in earlier days, emphasis
is placed upon the poverty
in which they lived to the exclusion
of the richness of spirit which they
possessed, so abundantly. This spiritual
wealth transmuted their everyday
living into graciousness and
splendor. There sang in their
hearts the knowledge that their daily
righteous acts were taking them
along the path to an eternal life
which would be beautiful and satisfying
beyond their most cherished
dreams and hopes. Also they had
entrenched in the fortresses of their
stout hearts the conviction of the
truth of the words of the Lord to
his Prophet: "My son, peace be unto
thy soul; thine adversity and thine
afflictions shall be but a small moment;
And then, if thou endure it
well, God shall exalt thee on high."

Those early-day saints felt an abiding
joy in their earthly lives and
their eyes were turned in to behold
the richness of their spirits which
caused their hearts to overflow with
thanksgiving.

No matter what the future may hold, these riches can never be snatched away by evil or designing men. By tending and nurturing them they will glow with a brighter hue and give light to the souls of the faithful by which, in spite of the cares and sorrows of the world, they will ultimately reach that flaming celestial world, there to dwell eternally in the presence of the Lord.
For these riches, true thanksgiving should be offered. M. C. S.

Chapter 8
Synopsis: Andrew Rumgay leaves his mother and his fiancée Jane Allison in Scotland and joins his friend Hugh Shand to emigrate to America. They meet Mother MacKinlay and her son Bob, whom they had known while doing missionary work, and become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship. While crossing the plains Andrew is lost in a blizzard and is rescued by Margaret. She later leaves the Macs and goes to live in Tooele.
Andrew and the Macs arrive in Zion and Kathleen and Hugh have a son—Mac Coleman Shand. Andrew farms and saves money to bring Jane from Scotland. When he finally sends it, he receives news that Jane has married someone else. Andrew is a grieved and lonely man and he sends for the two youngest children in his family. He is called on a mission, and Margaret comes to stay with the children while he is gone.

ANDREW became a hero overnight.
The news spread to every part of King's Kettle that Andrew Rumgay, the Mormon boy, who went to America a few years ago, had returned.
Friends and relatives from near and far began calling to see him, asking many questions. "What about the gold lying in the streets of America? What about all the free land? Does every man own his home? Are you rich, Andrew? Show us some of your wealth."
Andrew decided this was an opportunity to preach the gospel, so he answered every question carefully and truthfully.
The one thing in which they were all interested was the land. They would sit for hours and nod and listen to the young man discuss the soil—mother earth. It was the desire of every one of them to own a piece of ground.
He told them about the real wealth of America, the rich spiritual values—the purpose for which the land had been held for so many centuries for the restoration of the gospel.
He had seen Mormonism in action and it was wonderful.
"Yes, but we have a religion," they countered.
They had a church which most of them attended every Sunday. Father Douglas was a guid man. He baptized the children, preached a guid sermon, came whenever he was needed. Yes, they had a religion, but no land.
There were different places to which the restless sons of Scotland were emigrating—Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, but the choice of them all was America. For a few times on Sunday the branch church was filled to overflowing with people, in hopes the young elder from Utah would speak about America.

Andrew's mother's home of two rooms, which had furnished a roof over the heads of his loved ones since the happy day David Rumgay had carried Janet Black over its worn threshold, was still a model of efficiency. Everything was planned, budgeted, and carried out to the last detail. It had always taken careful organization to care for ten children without the father.

748 The thing that seemed uncanny to Andrew now was the suit problem his mother handled so skillfully. She had five boys to keep decently dressed at their work every day, and at church on Sunday. She kept a record of who got the suit last year, whose turn it was this year, material on hand, what relative had given them a worn suit, what she got out of it after washing and cutting it down. She had made every suit Andrew had worn, until the new suit he had bought for going away.
Life for the children was different in Scotland than in America. The bairns were all up at daylight, eating their porridge before their eyes were half open and, with their dinner pails in their hands, off to work before sunup. Often the Sabbath was the only day they saw the sun. The missionary thought of the children in Utah, well-fed and warmly clothed, with plenty of the necessities of life, if their parents were willing to work for them. They had time for rest and play, and the opportunity of attending school every day. How thankful he was that Bill and Janet were in Zion, and with such a wonderful person to take care of them!
E remembered that Margaret was very much like his mother around the house, quick and efficient in getting things done. He had worked, cooked, and cleaned for the bairns, and what a slow, hard job it had been. Then Margaret had come into his home, and he found there was magic in her touch. The place, so out of harmony at times, began to respond immediately to her woman's contact.
He smiled RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1948 when he remembered the curtains he had hung in such pitiful folds and plaits. The first night he had come home after Margaret had arrived the curtains fairly laughed and shouted, "Man, look at us now!" The dishes on the shelves kept their faces clean and shining in spite of the fact that they were still used three times a day. What a time he had had to keep them clean and he had been always breaking dishes.
Margaret was beautiful and so the cabin was beautiful, he recalled. Margaret smiled, and was cheerful, so the cabin was smiling and cheerful. He always thought of her in a long, full, billowy dress of blue, with flowers in her black, silken hair.
Andrew stayed close to his mother during his time out for visiting. All his friends and relatives had been to see him, and time was precious. Soon he would be leaving for his missionary work. So, while she cooked, darned, and mended, he read to his mother from the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. He wanted to study the gospel, so this was an opportunity for them to study together.
Janet Rumgay's joy was full and brimming over, as she sat and listened to her son. He was such a guid lad. Out of her tears, trials, heartaches, and prayers, he had somehow come through. He was growing to look like his father. David was about again now that Andrew had come back home. But David could not talk and read like Andrew. Mormonism had been like a college education for her son. She must keep all his brothers and sisters in the Church.
She often asked him about the young lady with the pretty name who was caring for the bairns.

He seemed to trust her; he never worried about the children. But then Mother Mac and Kathleen were near, if they should get sick. Andrew would become excited and very enthusiastic. "Why, Margaret is the best little nurse in America." His mother suggested that perhaps, only perhaps, if Margaret was willing to take care of the bairns, she might be willing to take care of him, too, when he returned. She watched his face light up and she studied him very intently, pleased with what she saw. Then Andrew would grow sad and disappointed again. "Why worry about Jane Allison when Margaret is in Utah? She must be wonderful, Andrew. She would make a guid Scotch wife for you, and you like her, I'm sure." Why worry? That was the question he was trying so hard to answer.

NE evening Andrew stood in his mother's doorway comparing Resplendence with King's Kettle. Resplendence was new and young, new land, new homes, new mountains, the great storehouses of water, homes, food, and wealth. King's Kettle was old; the soil needed constant replenishing; the homes were slowly wearing away. Just then the moon suddenly appeared from behind the clouds and spread its silvery light over his childhood home. It brought back pictures of the past. Jane was strangely in the floodlight, at home in the garden the night before he left for America; at the 749 monastery, promising to be faithful in life, faithful in death.

Suddenly a sweep of emotion came over Andrew. He crossed the street and went running up the trail, along the sidehill, toward the pits. Mary saw him and ran after him. "Andrew, Andrew, wait for me."

THEY climbed the hill together in silence, to the childhood trysting place. All the months of hard living on the plains, the days and nights of loneliness on the river bottoms, his precious dreams in the forest, overwhelmed him. There was no purpose in the life he had been living. Everything was gone with Jane. He sat down with his head in his hands, praying for self-control.

Mary began speaking softly. "I thought it better not to even mention her name. Maybe that wasn't the right way out. Now I will tell you everything I know. For nearly two years after you left, Jane was just the same. She came to Church and to see mother once and sometimes twice a week. Then she began to change. She didn't come to Church regularly, nor to see mother so often. You know how unreasonable Herbert Allison and his wife were against the Mormons. Well, your letters were far apart, and you wrote Jane all about the trek across the plains. Jane told me she was frightened. She could never live through such an experience, she said.

A few months later a man began calling at the Allison home. He was a business associate of Mr. Allison, and lived in Dumferline. He had a lot of money and property. You know what money meant to Jane. She was always the best-dressed girl at Church. Jane didn't go out with the stranger, but he continued to call. Later, they were married and made their home in Dumferline. She has riches, but not happiness. She still loves you. I met her in a store one day when I was shopping. She stopped and talked with me for a few minutes and asked about you. No, Andrew, Jane is far from being happy."

"Thanks, Mary. You've always been a true sister and such a comfort—pouring oil on turbulent waters." He smiled, took her hand, and they walked back home in the moonlight.

ANDREW'S peace of mind was won through the study and preaching of the gospel. He reported to his president, was assigned his companion, and they went to work. The Lord had been generous with him; he would be generous with the Lord. They studied and worked hard. They called at every home in King's Kettle and taught the gospel wherever the people would receive them. When the branch president was released, Andrew was appointed to take his place. They continued to work in King's Kettle and then went to nearby villages to tract. Finally, Andrew was made conference president and he and the elders continued to labor in the vineyard of the Lord.

ANDREW received many great blessings—health and peace of mind. He could see the hand of the Lord shaping his destiny, and he was a wise designer. The missionary was grateful for the hard things he had passed through; they were blessings in disguise.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1948

Then came the time his mission was completed. He was released to return home. Some months before Mary had told him of the death of Jane's husband. He received a letter from Jane, asking him to call, so he went for old time's sake. She lived in a castle, it seemed to the elder, on a street where only the rich could afford to live. He rang the doorbell. Jane answered it. She was charming, gracious, and had developed into a wonderful picture of womanliness, but Andrew was unmoved.

"I have this home, many acres of land, and a lot of money, left to me by father and my husband, and because, Andrew, I have never stopped loving you for one minute, I am asking you again not to go to Utah."

"My answer is the same," he said. "My home and all I shall ever want are in Zion. Now that I have completed my mission, I'm returning home."

"I'm sorry for what I did. I did not want to hurt you, but after I read of your long walk across the continent, I could not face it. Andrew, I am no pioneer. I hate poverty, misfits, everything that goes with it. I could not come. You have loved the riches of another world, while I love the wealth of this one. Our paths are so far apart. I am in the fog. You are beyond me."

"My treasures belong to this world, too, Jane. I draw my interest every moment of my life, and it is mine for the asking. I am no longer in the fog. My heart and head are clear and free."

"Someone else?" Jane inquired.

"Yes, Jane, I am sure there is someone else," Andrew said. He walked the flagged streets of Dumferline back to his childhood home. He wanted to think things through. Jane never would have been happy in the cabin or in Resplendence. How very thankful he was that she had not come.

His head was clear and free, but his heart was not free. At home in the cabin was the lass he loved. Margaret was a pioneer, and would make a wonderful wife for a pioneer. Jane would be happy in her beautiful home, with her acres of land and her money—while he would be happy in the cabin with the bairns, and with Margaret—if she cared enough for him to stay.

He prayed that he would not be too late in asking her.

November; Indian summer's warm red-gold Is now a graying ember. Dolls Do Not Grow Old Dorothy J]. Roberts OU lucky ladies who are mothers of little girls know that dolls do not grow old. Mari Etta has told you so, with proper six-year-old emphasis, and she will not surrender her dolls to the gaping mouth of the trash can. Many of these, to you, wan and bedraggled beauties of last year or years before, may be glamorized for next Christmas and reside, unashamed, beneath the lighted tree with the newest doll. Spirit the retrievable ones away in the weeks before the great day and in solitary moments try transforming them into pert and new someones. Begin by examining the dolls in shops and noting the dressed-up beauties in magazines, for ideas on hair arrangements and costuming. Also, keep in mind the beloved little heroines of fairyland and fable and those well-loved ladies who lived long ago or who are still with us, and don't forget the period and nationality dolls, Dutch, French, and Oriental. Now examine your doll's hair. If it is still present in any quantity, you can comb it carefully, separate it into locks, and put it up in bobbypin curls and leave it pinned up until the day. Or you can rebraid it and tie it with fresh ribbons. If the hair is scanty and the pate looks bare, switches of gleaming locks may be purchased at the dime stores to transform the plainest miss into a glamorous heroine. One hairpiece, cut in half, should be enough for two wigs. Some stores carry bright, short curls, at very little cost. With artificial hair, plus glue, and the help of a hat, you can arrange a new wig for the doll. The hat may have to be sewed on with the wig, but a young mistress will be pleased, nevertheless. To brighten up the pale doll, wash her carefully. With a damp cloth, then with a steady hand, repaint the lips with red nail polish. Paint the finger and toenails red also. Dutch Hat Fold of Material Seam DOLLS DO NOT GROW OLD Faded eyebrows may be touched with a bit of brown oil paint. Clothes may not make the man, but a doll is different. Since her small bisque body claims no soul (except to her little mother), habiliments become her chief charm. So let her have as many and as elegant costumes as your purse and inclination allow. Gather bright, clear-colored pieces of materials—cottons, satins, velvets, laces, braid—from scrap bags or remnants from dime stores. Basque waists and bouffant skirts are easily made and are loved by children, being a refreshing escape to elegance from their own simplified wardrobes. Ribbon bows placed here and there, a touch of gay embroidery, or a flower, will make of these clothes much prettier ones than can be purchased at average prices. If you have no time for sewing doll clothes yourself, perhaps a cousin or a young neighbor would like to take over the project for a fair sum. Hats can be made of scraps of felt or velvet or braid (sewed on a paper pattern in rounds for a beautiful, floppy hat). Dutch hats, made of one piece of felt, folded and stitched down one side, are pretty and suitable to sew on to the new hair. You will find that making a doll's trousseau is a fascinating little labor of love and one both you and the daughters will remember long after they are no longer little girls. THE SIMPLE THINGS OF LIFE Geneva I. Oldroyd I love the simple things of life That come to us each day, A baby's smile, a collie's bark, A group of boys at play; A garden growing in the sun And giving of its store, A rosebush in its second bloom Of beauty as before; My neighbor's nod across the fence, The postman's friendly smile, The sociability of friends— All these make life worth while. THE DEAREST SPOT Eunice J. Miles A place of peace, A rendezvous from harm, A roof against the gale To keep us warm; A cozy kitchen Where a kettle sings, And children prattle Over the artless things, Where love and friendliness Hold greatest worth— This is our home, The dearest spot on earth, Then—and Now! Sadie Ollerton Clark AST June my husband, David, our youngest son, and I took a brief vacation from the coastal plains of Texas. We had a happy reunion with friends in Utah, picked up Reid, another son who had just finished a school term at the State university, and turned the green Chevrolet south to Arizona, over the Grand Canyon bridge. We had planned on one more cool evening before we faced the heat of the Salt River Valley, and thought it would be a treat to the boys to stay overnight on the north rim of the canyon. But after an afternoon of climbing and sightseeing, both boys declared they would rather go on. It would be cooler to ride through the desert at night, they said, and we could sleep comfortably at Flagstaff. "Flagstaff is such a long way," I protested. "It will take us all night to get there." "It is just a four or five-hour drive," declared our eldest. "We can be there before midnight." Knowing from past experience he could outargue me, and also that he was generally right, I found my place in the back seat of the car. We drove through the beautiful meadows of the Kaibab just as the sun was shedding its last rays. On one side of the road we could see deer and cattle grazing together, and on the other, a stately stag posing on a cliff, as if for a picture. Then, as my husband took my hand, I knew that he, as well as I, was seeing this scene twice—now, and as it looked twenty-four years ago when he brought me, his bride, to this lovely spot for our honeymoon. The mountains and pastures looked just the same. The deer and cattle together could have been an identical picture. But on that turn of the road where one white-tailed doe bounded lightly into the forest we remembered a band of twenty-five bucks.

We had surprised dozens of the delicate little creatures who had given us startled glances and darted away. Either not so many deer, I thought, or they keep hidden better. And I looked in vain for the whitetailed, black squirrels which I remembered were formerly everywhere. The moon was coming up as we left the great forest and started down the historic hill to the desert. Twenty-four years ago we would not have dared cross it at such an hour. Then, we had looked down upon the same scenes—the interminable range of low, red mountains so symbolic of this country, with the only landmark in all those endless desert miles a low rock house at the foot of the hill. My thoughts traveled backward.... Leigh and I started down that rocky trail which (nearly a quarter of a century ago) served for a road. We saw a car near the rock house and two men, probably a quarter of a mile away, climbing toward us. As they came closer they hailed us, and we looked to our water supply, for we thought they would surely need a drink. But as THEN—AND NOW

We approached them they waved a small canteen at us and swore mildly.

"Wouldn't you know it—just a couple of kids! Where on earth are you heading for?"

"Flagstaff, and on to Phoenix."

"Flagstaff!" One of them sat weakly on the tuning board while the other cried, "Take a fool's advice and turn back. You will never make it." They told us their story. They had been stuck in the sand, time after time, and had dug themselves out with their bare and blistered hands. They had been four days crossing the desert, and when they reached the rock house they had had to abandon their car because their gasoline supply was exhausted. We talked to them a few minutes, but assured them we were going on. They refused our offer of water and continued their climb, shaking their heads, while we jolted down over the sharp rocks of the old wagon road.

This was not the first time we had been discouraged. The day before, a few miles out of Kanab, we had partially broken a spring. The owner of a combined livery stable and garage sold us a used one, but when we told him we intended to cross Lee's Ferry he was surprised.

"Why didn't you go by way of California?" he asked. "You'll never make it this way."

We explained that we had intended going another route. In fact, we had been in Yellowstone Park the previous week, and before we dared start for the Pacific Coast we had telegraphed for advice on getting into Arizona from California. Our answer had been to avoid California 755 as Arizona had a quarantine against California cars in June of 1924 because of a raging epidemic of hoof and mouth disease. Cars had been held up at the bridges for weeks, and there was no relief in sight, so we had decided to try Lee's Ferry.

Our adviser was still pessimistic. He said we would get stuck in the sand, that he had taken a party to the Ferry just a few days before, and that he charged fifty dollars for the trip, but after these people had seen the road they had given him one hundred dollars. But we couldn't afford even fifty dollars. It had taken practically every cent we had to spare to buy that spring for the car.

We weren't afraid, but we hated to appear too self-confident, so we left him, saying we would go on to the canyon and decide what to do then. There was no hotel at the north rim in 1924, so we camped out. The business of the canyon seemed to be centered in a big, log store and post office. Just after dark we walked toward it.

Coming through the windows we heard strange and unearthly sounds of music, accompanied by weird shrieks and wails. Curiously, and a little frightened, we pushed our way into the big room and watched a man engaged in one of the favorite pastimes of the day—working the dial of a home-built radio and trying to find every station he could reach. It was my first encounter with a radio!

Leigh talked to some of the men gathered there. When they learned we were planning to go across Lee's Ferry, they looked at us in amazement. I don't recall that they actually told us not to try to 756 go, but one after another started telling some pretty tall stories, or so they sounded to me.

I can picture one of the men now, long and lean, wearing high-heeled boots and Stetson hat and faded overalls. He waved his hand toward the great chasm and pointed out some dim and flickering lights from the blackness beyond.

"See those lights?" he said. "Well, last summer an old party came here late in the afternoon—him and his wife in a big Packard limousine with a Negro chauffeur. They turned up their noses at our accommodations here but decided to spend the night in one of the cabins. When it was dark enough to see the lights, the man asked where they were coming from, and I told him they were from El 'Tovar, the big hotel on the south rim."

"How far is it across?" he says.

"Thirteen miles," I say.

"He turned to his wife and said, 'Let's go over for dinner and stay there.'"

Well, we all thought he was joking, so we all chipped in and said, "Yes, why don't you? It's an easy drive, only thirteen miles," and so on. We couldn't understand how ignorant a feller could be about distances out here. But when we saw they were actually taking us serious and were putting their bags in the car we changed our tune.

We told him he couldn't drive to the other side that night. It was 135 miles of no roads at all, and he couldn't carry enough gas in that big Packard to get him over there.

Well, this old guy had taken us serious at first, and now for a while he thought we were joking. When he found out we meant it, he got RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1948 stubborn and accused us of trying to make them stay in this wild place. We finally persuaded him to fill his tank and take five gallons of gas extra.

But this old boy, he had an awful time. He made it to the Ferry all night, but the next day he ran out of gas. There wasn't a chance of anyone coming along that road who could help him, so he left his wife and the colored man and started to walk. He walked all day, lost in those hot, dry hills, but finally found an Indian camp, and bought some kerosene. It took him all the next day to get back to the car, and another day to get to the Little Colorado, to a filling station.

They had run out of water and were nearly dead when they finally reached El Tovar. He said all he wanted to do was to get out of this forsaken country and he would never come back. He had enough of western scenery to last him all the rest of his life!" All the men laughed and several recalled the circumstances. Others had more stories to tell, but Leigh and I said nothing. The next morning we took a last look at the magnificent gorge and started back through the Kaibab. At Jacob's Lake, Leigh stopped the car and asked, "Which way?" I answered, "Don't be silly. We've got to get home." "Hail, oh, hail to Arizona!" sang my husband as we drove through the wonderful Kaibab Forest to the top of the hill. "Jumping off place," I called it. It was there we had met the two men. We were soon on the desert, trying to follow a poor semblance of a road. It was never too clearly defined. Sometimes we just drove south, but sooner or later we found the trail. The year 1924 was unusually dry, and there wasn't a green plant anywhere. Off in the distance, not far from the rock house, we saw a herd of wild buffalo. They looked weak and disheartened from lack of food and water. We wondered if they would be alive by August.

We were stuck in the sand several times, but Leigh had had foresight enough to bring a shovel. We would put brush under the wheel, dig a little, and the famous pulling power of the old 1917 Dodge would get us out of that hole. Late in the afternoon we knew we were nearing the river, as we could see signs of green, which could be cottonwood trees. Just before we reached the Ferry we came onto a most interesting scene. In one sand area were hundreds of balanced rocks and peculiar formations. Delightedly, we took pictures. Then on a sandstone cliff we saw a carved date—1879.

"Grandfather Noble came over this road about that date, when he moved his family to Arizona," said Leigh.

The ruggedness of the country, the silence and absence of any life made me wonder if we were the first humans to travel this road since! But at the Ferry we were received casually enough. The man who collected our dollar said he ferried a car across every few days, and saw no hardships ahead. It was a thrill to put the car on the historic, old Ferry. I tried to ask questions about the history of the place, but our pilot didn't seem anxious to talk, although he did tell us that a few years before the cable broke and the boat got out of control. I wondered if the passengers had been asking too many questions at the time.

The green cottonwoods and willow trees gave a grateful shade to the hot country. We saw snatches of gardens and fruit trees, but the ferryman's business was to get us across the river, which he did, with dispatch. We climbed "Lee's Backbone," the rocky hill on the south side of the river, about sunset. Leigh recalled his mother's stories about crossing this road as a young girl. Her father had been sent by the Church as a bishop to a small Arizona town, and they had traveled these wearisome desert miles by team and wagon. It took them a month, and one of the nightmare spots of the trip had been the climb up "Lee's Backbone."

We blessed the Dodge for its comparative speed and endurance, and drove on about ten miles, congratulating ourselves on making the terrible journey with so little trouble. Then, as it was beginning to get dark, we made our camp.

In those days there were few road maps, and for some reason, probably because the people who had tried to frighten us had nearly always emphasized the danger of the north side of the Ferry, we thought we were practically to Flagstaff. Because the air was heavily loaded, Leigh threw away our big can of water, and we lay there in that wilderness, listening to the coyotes howling and promised ourselves we would sleep in a hotel the next night.

I suppose it was because we thought we would surely get somewhere soon that made the next day so long. It seemed almost endless. The rocks of the "jumping-off place" hill had cut into our tires and we had to stop and patch one every hour or so. The road wasn't so bad, but it didn't seem to lead any place. Once we came upon some fresh wagon tracks, and followed them twenty miles, only to find that they turned around and came back over the same ruts. Forty miles lost! We put a few rocks in the road to discourage the next traveler from making our mistake, and went on. But our water supply was running low and we bitterly regretted leaving the big can behind.

Late that afternoon we reached the "Little Colorado" trading post. The river was dry, but the store was open. A woman waited on us, and expressed no surprise at seeing us. She allowed us only one canteen of water for ourselves and the car. We decided to drive on, no matter how long it took us, when we heard the now tragically familiar sound of another blowout. In disgust, Leigh pulled off the road. "I can't fix another one tonight," he said wearily. "We will just camp here and go on in the morning."

We put up the cot. There was only a swallow or two of water left in the canteen, and we laughingly made a ceremony of drinking it. Then we lay down to the most fantastic dreams. They were all about water. We were swimming in it, sailing on it, but when we reached for a drink it was gone.

We were awakened from this uneasy slumber by the sound of a car passing us, and we thought we heard someone laugh. We sat up in bed and looked about us. It was barely light, but Leigh recognized the place. We had made our bed in a triangle of grass which marked a junction of three roads—one west to Flagstaff, one east to Albuquerque, and the northern one we had traveled!

I had fallen asleep as my tall son drove swiftly across the same old desert on well-paved roads, and I was awakened by a display of neon signs and flashing lights.

"This is the junction," Reid said. "It will be in Flagstaff in a few minutes."

"The junction!" I cried. "I remember this place. And I'm thirsty!"

Then I smiled, a little embarrassed, even after all these years.

"If there had been a few lights twenty-four years ago we wouldn't have been caught in such a predicament," I explained, mostly to myself. "But what time is it?"

It was just four hours since we had left Jacob's Lake.

"It's too short a time even to realize where we've been," I said.

"Would you rather have it the way it was before?" jibed my youngest.

Would I? Well, I'll have to admit I appreciate all the comfort I can get when I travel these days. But take twenty-four years from my age and give me the same boyish companion, and I would still be thrilled to face the unknown. For if you never get off the paved highway, and can make a month's journey in four hours, where is the excitement, or the fun, or the adventure?

"Now, what are you thinking?" Maury demanded.
"Of your father's house."
"Why?"
"PM remembering how small it was, and how there was always room for people—always room for the hungry, the cold, the cast out. - - everyone who needed food and friendship."
She laughed.
"Hard put we were at times to make it go, but that is where my father's thrift was right welcome."
"That's what I mean," he said. "Some people, who have little, have so much. And some, who have much, have nothing at all."
He looked about him.
"Gosh! I have a lot to learn, like how it's not the food that makes Thanksgiving, but the seasonings from the heart."
She nodded.
"Aye, I know."
She looked at the clock.
"You must hurry now. You must not be late for her dinner."
John pursued the last shred of turkey.
"Maury, did I ever tell you that red is my favorite shade of hair?"
She paused, fork in midair.
Tears sprang suddenly upon her glowing cheeks.
"Nay, you didna'.. You really find it fair?" 
"T find it fair," John repeated.

WILD GEESE
Beatrice K. Ekman

Above the marshes and reed-fringed lagoon,
I hear the wild geese honking in their flight;
Bathed in the luster of the hunter's moon,
They dip their wings down trackless lanes of night.
Over the coarse marsh grass pale vapors rise,
On the dark lake a bright moon-path is drawn,
As, faint and faraway, the honking dies
And wild geese merge with moonbeams and are gone.

I WAIT FOR SPRING
Grace Sayre

I shall pause long when autumn's golden flame
Burns in the maple's glory, to its last dim ash.
I cannot bear earth's poignant claim,
Graying to embers in a wintry blast.
The leaves that drift beyond the garden wall
Will rest in golden layers on the sod;
But I must not look back to see them fall.
I pause.... While empty boughs commune with God.
And who am I to gaze on nature's pall?
I wait for spring where autumn's gold is massed,
And by these symbols, know the year has passed.

A Party for You
Sara Mills

HERE'S party blood in your veins. Read one of the old pioneer diaries. It will tell of furniture pushed outside to make room for dancing feet. Any pretext was enough: a visitor, a person about to go visiting, or no pretext at all. Often as not the party lasted through the night to morning chore time. It was these parties that kept gaiety alive in the bleak days.

Now, in far-removed 1948, you have an essential need to keep gaiety nourished. Give at least one party this holiday season. The memory of it will leave a warm glow to help you up the steep, cold ascent of the January and February hills.

We're passing on to you a menu for a party dinner you can engineer single-handed, if need be. The dinner is an easy one, but so good it will set the tempo for a fine, blithe evening.

Roast turkey is the main dish (as cheap as any other in these days). It is abetted by potatoes au gratin in an elegant guise; a salad that can be made the day before, and a fruitcake. This may be the one you made in November, or the mincemeat fruitcake listed on the menu.

For bread, buy clover-leaf rolls and break them in threes for serving. Dress your turkey the night before, down to the last stitch. Also make your salad the day before, and prepare your potatoes. The dinner is self-serving, of course. Because your oven will be turkey occupied in the afternoon, set your potatoes to bake in the casserole the first thing in the morning. Then keep them covered on top of the oven, popping them in the last thing to be re-heated.

For a drink, use your favorite fruit-juice concoction, hot or cold.

MENU

Roast turkey with dressing warm
Potatoes au gratin
Pear jello
Celery with avocado cheese relish
Cranberry sauce
Mincemeat fruitcake
Clover-leaf rolls
Fruit drink

POTATOES AU GRATIN

Potatoes (boiled in skins, approximately one large one to two persons)
Thin cheese sauce (about 1/2 cup of grated American cheese to each pint of thin white sauce)
Bread crumbs (fine and dry)
1 large onion, sliced
Worcestershire sauce
Butter, salt, and pepper

Boil the potatoes in their jackets. When they are cool, slice them in smallish pieces and place them in a large dish. Season with salt and scatter slices of raw onion throughout the potatoes. Cover and leave in a cool place overnight.

Next morning, remove all onion slices. Make a thin white sauce of butter, flour, and milk. Add the seasonings and the grated American cheese. In a large casserole, place alternate layers of potatoes, bread crumbs, and cheese sauce, topping the dish with a thin layer of crumbs. Dust lightly with pepper and dot with butter. Place in a low oven, about 250°, and bake for two hours.

Taste well for seasoning, have plenty of the thin cheese sauce, and bake slowly. You will have a dish of rarely blended flavors.

RELIEF SOCIETY HOLDS SUCCESSFUL BAZAAR, December 5, 1947
A dancing party was held in connection with this bazaar, which was planned as a Christmas gift sale and social. It was a very successful occasion and netted over $250 which was contributed toward financing the new ward chapel now being planned. This little organization, having only thirty members, has completed its quota for the Relief Society Building Fund. The organization was assigned $150 and $159 was collected.

The sisters are happy to have an interest in this beautiful building, soon to be built for the women of the Church.

Sister Sharp comments regarding this interesting branch: "A number of years ago a family by the name of Futter heard this wonderful gospel. There were the father, mother, and eight children, five girls and three boys. In a short time they joined the Church and have been faithful members ever since. A few years ago the family moved to Springs and all of them live there now except one daughter who lives in East London. This daughter is interested in Relief Society and is a subscriber to the Magazine. The Springs Branch Relief Society is a family affair—except for Gertrude Stemmett, but she is, with the others, a member of the Relief Society family. The Springs Branch is very wide awake and very ambitious. When they have a bazaar they make a number of lovely things, knit and hand-embroidered, as well as many good things to eat. After doing all this work and making many donations... they buy back their own things."

Another project, primarily for the convenience of the members of this society, was the making up, by means of a hectograph, of booklets listing the names and addresses of all the branch members. At a dime apiece, these more than paid for the hectograph.

The group is now at work on menu booklets featuring recipes that can be prepared in advance, so mothers can get to Sunday School. These booklets should pay for the quilting frames ordered recently.

The Practice of Consonants for Better Singing
Florence Jepperson Madsen Member, Relief Society General Board

He who knows how to breathe and how to pronounce, knows well how to sing (Pacchiarotti).

THERE are various approaches to the improvement of word resonance and clarity in speech and song. One of these is to quickly leave the consonant and sustain the vowel. This should be practiced with the following syllables: may, may, may, etc.

Me, me, me; my, my, my; mah, mah, mah; mo, mo, mo, moo, moo, moo.

After practicing these alone combine them, as for example: me, may, mah; my, may, me; mah, mo, moo; me, may, mo; me, may, my, mah, mo, moo, etc.

When moderate facility has been gained in singing the above exercises replace the M with the consonants: B, P, N, L, D, T, W, etc. The L is particularly useful in effecting tongue flexibility.

After sufficient technique has been acquired in vowel and consonant articulation, definite words should be used to apply this skill. With this objective in view, the following list of words should be practiced both in speaking and in singing:

May, Bay, Pay
Maun, Dawn, Pawn
Mayme, Name, Lame
My, By, Lie
Mate, Bate, Date
Might, Bite, Night

Mah, Bah, Paw
Mile, Dial, Tile
Mall, Doll, Ball
Mow, Bow, Doe
Mote, Dote, Note
Mole, Toll, Dole

Me, Be, Lea
Meet, Beet, Neat
Meal, Deal, Peel
Moo, Boo, Too
Moon, Boon, Doon
Mood, Food, Wooed

These groups of three words should be increased to include others—words commencing and ending with different consonants, sustaining the vowels longer and longer. Practice all syllables and words first on one particular pitch, then on different pitches, scale and chordwise.

Sing the exercises in the easy range of the voice and according to definite rhythmical patterns. When three syllables are sung the triplet group may be employed to good advantage and practiced sequentially up and down the scale.

When syllables and words beginning with a single consonant have been learned, attention should be turned to the study of double consonants preceding a vowel, such as the following:

Blay, Blee, Blah, Blow, Bloo
Flay, Flee, Flaw, etc.
Play, Plee, Plah, etc.
Dray, Dree, Drah, etc. (The R is slightly trilled with the tip of the tongue.)

The articulation of consonants, single or double, should be short and distinct, the sustained vowel being the tone.

Clear, flexible speech is a prerequisite to beautiful singing.

Theology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior
Lesson 13—"The Apostolic Mission and Events Related Thereto"
Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 21, by Elder James E. Talmage)

For Tuesday, February 1, 1949

Objective: To show how those who put their trust in the Lord gain spiritual power and knowledge.

Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ.

FOLLOWING the events described in our last lesson, Jesus returned for a brief visit to Nazareth. The people there had rejected him once but he was willing to give them another chance. He is always merciful and willing to forgive. He went to the synagogue and they were astonished at the marvelous work he had done. However, the people were looking for a Messiah and rejected him a second time. They said he was the "... Son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and Juda and Simon." His relatives were plain folk. "And they were offended at him."

At Nazareth, Jesus did not accomplish any great work because of lack of faith among the people.

The Twelve Charged and Sent

The work of the ministry needed expanding. Jesus sent forth his apostles on separate missions to preach the gospel. They had been students under the Master for many months; now they were to leave him and commence the work that Page 770 ultimately took them into all parts of the known world.

At first they were to go only to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel." These were to be given the first chance. This was only a temporary restriction. Later they were to go among all nations.

Always they were to preach, "the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

They were given the Priesthood and told to "Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give" (Matt. 10:8). They were to rely upon divine aid for all their needs.

They were not to take money and were not even to take thought of their lives.?

Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? (Matt. 6:25).

All these things were to be provided if they would have faith.

They were told:

But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (Matt. 6:33).

LESSON DEPARTMENT

The apostles were not to give offense. They were sent as sheep among wolves. The Lord would guide them. Jesus said to them: "For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you" (Matt. 10:20).

The Lord well knew that families would be divided and much strife would result when children would be arrayed against parents and neighbor against neighbor. The apostles would be hated and would endure much suffering, but they ought not to expect a life of ease. Their Master had not escaped. If they were faithful, their Father would watch over them. The love of their work must supercede every other thing.

With these important instructions and the knowledge that the Holy Ghost would guide them, they left on their missions. Jesus continued his personal ministry.

The length of time the apostles were gone on their missions is not given. Their labors greatly increased the spread of the gospel of the kingdom. In the meantime, Jesus continued his marvelous work. It is easy to understand how his fame had spread far and wide and was causing much excitement. Herod Antipas had given the order for John the Baptist to be killed, and since his death, he was afraid of the people. He averred that Jesus was the Baptist returned from the tomb.

The Twelve Return

The report of the apostles, when they returned, was very encouraging. They had taken the message wherever they had gone. In each of the cities or towns they had visited, they had preached the gospel of repentance. They had anointed the sick with oil and, by the power of the Priesthood, the afflicted ones had been healed. In fact, they had done mighty works among the people.

After their return, Jesus took the Twelve to the desert for a brief rest, but eager crowds followed them. As the multitude gathered on the hillside whither they had gone, Jesus looked upon the vast throng with pity. He first taught them many things, healed their sick and comforted them.

Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light (Matt. 11:28-30).

Five Thousand Fed in the Desert

The crowd was so interested that evening came on before they realized the passing of time. It was springtime and the people could stay all night, but they had no food.

The disciples urged Jesus to send the people away:
But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. He said, Bring them hither to me. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children (Matt. 14:16-21).

Human knowledge is powerless to explain the miracle. It was done by the power of God. The Creator, however, taught a great lesson against waste. Barley bread and fish contributed the chief diet of the people in that region. The Master had them gather the broken meat and bread and there was much more left than the whole of the original supply. The people soon began to discuss the miracle. This was the Messiah for whom they were looking. He had power to feed them. They started a movement to proclaim him king to reign instead of the unpopular Herod. However, Jesus dismissed the now excited multitude and directed his apostles to leave by boat. Ascending the hill alone he spent most of the night in prayer.

Jesus Walks Upon the Water

The return trip by boat proved to be a memorable journey for the disciples. A storm arose and the small ship toiled heavily in a rough sea. The men could not use the sails and could survive only by holding the vessel by sheer strength. Jesus knew of their plight and came to their rescue by walking on the storm-tossed waters. When the disciples saw him coming, they thought he was a ghost and were frightened.

But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I, be not afraid. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God (Matt. 14:27-33).

This event was a demonstration that faith is a principle of power. It only we could have faith, the Lord would say to our troubled souls, "It is I, be not afraid."

In the Land of Gennesaret

They landed near a place called Gennesaret—one of the beauty spots of that region. From there, they journeyed north to Capernaum. In the towns through which they passed, "the sick were laid in the streets, that the blessing of his passing might fall upon them." In fact, they "besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole" (Matt. 14:36).

In Search of Loaves and Fishes

Jesus soon discovered that the people who had been fed in the desert were seeking him again that they might partake of his bounty. The Lord rebuked them, saying:
. . . Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled (John 6:26).

They wanted to follow one who would feed them.

The Lord then gave some vital instructions:
Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed (John 6:27).

It was hard for them to understand. He urged them to believe in him and obey his gospel. They knew that while Moses led their fathers, the Lord had provided manna. They had seen the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Why could they not believe now in Jehovah? Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus the Christ of the New Testament.

Christ, the Bread of Life
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world (John 6:32-33).
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead . . . if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever . . . (John 6:49, 51).
Once before the Lord had given similar ideas when he spake to the woman of Samaria (John 4:13-15):
Though within the reach of all who diligently strive to gain it, faith is nevertheless a divine gift, and can be obtained only from Christ.
Jesus said, "I am the bread of life." That bread, he stated, was his flesh. "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day" (John 6:54). The symbolism of bread and water is, perhaps, more difficult for us to understand on first reading than it was for the Jews. "The idea of eating, as a metaphor for receiving spiritual benefit, was familiar to Christ's hearers, and was as readily understood as our expressions 'devouring a book,' or 'drinking in instructions.' " 'The ribbis,' . . . laid it down as a rule, that wherever, in Ecclesiastes, allusion was made to food or drink, it meant study of the law, and the practice of good works" (Geikie. Life and Words of Christ, 1, page 184; page 43 textbook). By the symbolism, Jesus taught that we were to believe in him as the literal Son of God and keep his commandments.
However, it must not be overlooked that his doctrine was difficult for the Jews to accept.
Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? (John 6:60).
". . . Doth this offend you? What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?" (John 6:61-62). Surely it was implied that after his death and resurrection he would ascend to his Father. Only through the Holy Ghost can these great truths be known. "It is the spirit that quickeneth.. I From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him" (John 6:63, 66). This evoked the inquiry from Jesus unto the Twelve: "Will ye also go away?" Peter answered with deep conviction: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1948 and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God (John 6:67-69).
Though they did not fully understand all the doctrine, "they knew Jesus to be the Christ."
Questions and Suggestions for Discussion,
1. Enumerate the powers that were given to the apostles of Jesus when they were sent forth on their first great missions. Tell also of the duties required of them.
2. Read Matt. 11:28-30 and tell of your own happiness found in the service of the Lord.
3. Give an account of the feeding of the multitude by the Savior.
4. Did the Savior mean it literally when he said, "Ye are the salt of the earth..— Ye are the light of the world," etc.
Visiting Teachers Messages—Ou" Savior Speaks
Lesson 5—Judge Not That Ye Be Not Judged"
Elder H. Wayne Driggs
For Tuesday, February 1, 1949
Objective: To point out that it is not our place to pass judgment on another.
WHEN the Savior gave us the injunction "Judge not, that ye be not judged," he set for his followers a standard which is hard to live up to. This is because it seems natural for all of us, in our finite state, to see the imperfections of our own. Not once, but many times did the Savior teach those who gathered round him that they gave them Later, to the scribes and the Pharisees he made it clear that even they whose office it was to interpret the law, must not condemn the woman taken in sin, for they themselves "Let him who is without sin, cast the first stone," he said. He tells us to substitute mercy for harsh judgment.
Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven (Luke 6:36-37).
Because of our human frailties there will always be flaws in our natures. It is easy to sit in judgment upon another, but it is unjust to do so since we cannot know all the circumstances that may have contributed towards an act. The Savior knew that only God can render a just judgment, for he alone knows the intents of one's heart. Outward appearances and actions may be misunderstood and misconstrued. There is no living man who is all-wise and who can judge the justice of an act from its inception in the mind to its final result.
Albeit the Lord has given to some of his servants, including the bishop of the ward, to be common judges, and to such persons so authorized, gives them wisdom and discernment and inspiration sufficient to qualify them to act in this high place. "Judge not, that ye be not judged" (Matthew 7:1).
Work Meeting—Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)
Lesson 5—Outmoded Formals
Jean Ridges Jennings
For Tuesday, 'February 15, 1949
PERHAPS the one article in a woman's wardrobe which gives the least value for the money expended is the formal. Often there is no room in the family budget for a mother's formal, and if there is she hesitates to buy one because she feels she won't get enough wear from it.
Formals need not be considered wasteful or extravagant if we extend their usefulness by making them over into attractive articles of clothing after we have grown tired of them as formals or when they have become outmoded. One might even be farsighted enough to plan the new formal with a view to using it later for some other purpose.
For first consideration is the possibility of shortening a formal and either dyeing it or combining it with other material for use as an afternoon or street dress. This, of course is done only if it can be made appropriate to the occasion. Or why not have a dressy negligee or house coat for a feeling of luxury in those few odd moments of leisure lounging? Often, when a fancy housecoat or robe is an extravagance, an old evening gown can be converted into something of this sort that may give much pleasure.
As has been stated many times before, one must always be careful to make sure that the color and type of material in garments that are made over is becoming to the individual who is to wear the garment. In some cases little girl's dresses can be fashioned from old formals.

If the material is dainty in color and launderable, it is especially usable for this purpose. With the current trend for fuller, longer skirts there is a strong fad for ruffled petticoats. Where is a more logical place to turn for the material from which to make one than to old formals? Taffetas, satins, and other slick materials are usually good to use, and any color in the rainbow, or combination of colors is in vogue. From dresses of washable materials and pastel colors, other undergarments can be made both for children and grownups. Use such dresses for slips, panties, and camisoles. Here, again, is a source of material for blouses. The possibilities are almost unlimited. There is no end to the kinds and colors of material from which one could make a blouse. Whether eyelet pique, silk crepe, taffeta, sheer chiffon, or even heavy brocade, most everyone could fit the blouse into her wardrobe for varieties of occasions. And, as a last suggestion, consider the possibility of redecorating a bedroom with ruffles fashioned from the skirt of an old formal. Make a new skirt for the dressing table, a ruffle around the edge of a mirror, fluffy bows for curtain tie-backs. Or you could even disguise a shabby table or makeshift for a table with a full circular flounce falling to the floor that you made from your old dress.

Literature of the Gospel Restoration Lesson 5—Earlier Evangelistic Literature Elder Howard R. Driggs

For Tuesday, February 15, 1949

FERVOR to share the enriched truths of the restored gospel—to radiate its glorious new light—naturally brought some stirring evangelistic literature. Missionaries, as soon as the Church had been organized, were sent forth. Not only did they voice the glad tidings whenever they found folk to listen, but gradually they used pen and press to spread the newly revealed word of God farther and wider. It was all impelled by a desire to share—to keep the good things that had come by giving them to others. Indeed one can keep the gospel bright and beautiful only by sharing it. Zeal to do this vibrates through the writings of those earlier missionaries. It still does in the work of today.

Two things, however, seem to add to the intensity of the early-day earnestness: first, the nearness to the Prophet and to the divine drama of the restoration; second, the testing hardships and bitter persecution that had to be met and overcome. We are brought closer to all this in the Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, one of the outstanding missionaries who lived through those soul-searching, early-day experiences.

With Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, and Ziba Peterson, Parley was on the first official mission—this to the Lamanites on the Missouri frontier. A few paragraphs from his Autobiography, a volume of high literary merit, will help make the story live again.

The four elders, after traveling afoot for hundreds of miles, and meeting with outstanding success in converting folk in and around Kirtland, Ohio, finally found themselves in Illinois, where they were halted, "by a dreadful storm of rain and snow, which lasted for a week or more. Although in the midst of strangers," writes Elder Pratt, "we were kindly entertained, found many friends, and preached to large congregations in several neighborhoods."

His story continues:

In the beginning of 1831 we renewed our journey; and passing through St. Louis and St. Charles, we travelled on foot for three hundred miles through vast prairies and through trackless wilds of snow—no beaten road; houses few and far between; and the bleak northwest wind always blowing in our faces with a keenness which would almost take the skin off the face. We travelled for whole days, from morning till night, without a house or fire, wading in snow to the knees at every step. . . . We carried on our backs our changes of clothing, several books, and corn bread and raw pork. We often ate our frozen bread and pork by the way, when the bread would be so frozen that we could not bite or penetrate any part of it but the outside crust (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, chapter VII).

On reaching Independence—gateway town to the untamed West—two of the elders found employment as tailors to help, while Oliver Cowdery and Parley P. Pratt crossed the frontier line and commenced a mission among the Indians. The first night was passed with the Shawnees, then the elders went over the Kansas River to work among the Delawares. There they found the principal chief—"a venerable looking man" held in reverence as "the great-grandfather, or Sachem of ten nations or tribes." The two missionaries were made welcome by this Indian leader; and after he learned, through an interpreter, of their errand, particularly something of the Bible they brought, he called a council. Oliver Cowdery then addressed the red men. His words, as recorded by Elder Pratt, in part, follow:

Thousands of moons ago, when the red men's forefathers dwelt in peace and possessed this whole land, the Great Spirit talked with them, and revealed His law and His will, and much knowledge to their wise men and prophets. This they wrote in a Book; together with their history, and the things which should befall their children in the latter days.

This Book was written on plates of gold, and handed down from father to son for many ages and generations.

It was then that the people prospered, and were strong and mighty; they cultivated the earth; built buildings and cities, and abounded in all good things, as the pale faces now do.

But they became wicked; they killed one another and shed much blood; they killed their prophets . . . and sought to destroy the Book. The Great Spirit became angry, and would speak to them no more ....
This Book, which contained these things, was hid in the earth by Moroni, in a hill called by him, Cumorah ....
In that neighborhood there lived a young man named Joseph Smith, who prayed to the Great Spirit much, in order that he might know the truth; and the Great Spirit sent an angel to him, and told him where this Book was hid by Moroni; and commanded him to go and get it. He accordingly went to the place, and dug in the earth, and found the Book written on gold plates.
But it was written in the language of the forefathers of the red man; therefore this young man, being a pale face, could not understand it; but the angel told him and showed him, and gave him a knowledge of the language and how to interpret the Book. So he interpreted it into the language of the pale faces, and wrote it on paper, and caused it to be printed ....

So we have now come from him, and here is a copy of the Book, which we now present to our red friend, the chief of the Delawares, and which we hope he will cause to be read and known among his tribe; it will do them good.
Observe here, how Oliver Cowdery, with teaching skill, meets the minds of his listeners simply, concretely, and in terms the Indians could understand. This is real literary art. It was in a dramatic setting—worthy of portrayal by a gifted painter.
The response of the Indian chief is likewise picturesque and touching:
We feel truly thankful to our white friends who have come so far, and been at such pains to tell us good news, and especially this new news concerning the Book of our forefathers; it makes us glad in here (placing his hand on his heart).
It is now winter, we are new settlers in this place; the snow is deep, our cattle and horses are dying; our wigwams are poor; we have much to do in the spring—to build houses, and fence and make farms; but we will build a council house, and meet together, and you shall read to us and teach us more concerning the Book of our fathers and the will of the Great Spirit (Ibid., chapter VIII).
These good intentions unfortunately could not be carried out. Rising interest on the part of the Indians in Mormonism brought immediate opposition to missionary work among them. Indian agents, stirred doubtless by sectarian enmity, ordered our elders, with threat of using military force, off the reservation.
The elders left to continue their work for a time around Independence. It is interesting to note that the very same year our Latter-day Saint missionaries were trying to carry the restored gospel to the Indians, 1831, four chieftains from the farther Northwest came down the Missouri River to St. Louis seeking what they called "The White Man's Book of Heaven." Two of these red men died that winter in the frontier city; the other two returned to their people in the wilds, disappointed; they had been given gifts enough, as one of them said, "to make our moccasins heavy," but the light of the gospel they sought had not been given to them. Their people must still "sit in darkness." Had the Latter-day Saint missionaries been permitted to carry forward their work, the desire of the red men for light and truth might at the time have been splendidly gratified.
Although this first mission of our four young elders, so far as the Indians were concerned, was thwarted, there was rich fruitage from it elsewhere. Not alone in Kirtland, where a religious leader, Sidney Rigdon, and practically his whole congregation, joined the Latter-day Saints, but elsewhere along their route, the elders gathered hundreds into the fold. It was the beginning of a great missionary work, leading to the calling of many others into the service of spreading the gospel far and wide.
All of this zeal was inspired by the Prophet, who gave himself untiringly to the labor of love for mankind. His devoted brother Samuel had pioneered the carrying of the gospel into the wider field when he went forth alone to try to sell the Book of Mormon. Though generally rebuffed and unwelcomed on his humble mission, Samuel did place one copy of the Book where it reached Brigham Young, and through him, Heber C. Kimball. A first convert made by Parley P. Pratt was his own brother Orson. Later, in Canada, he also brought John Taylor into the fold. George A. Smith, a cousin to the Prophet and grandfather of our President George Albert Smith, and another leader Wilford Woodruff, were also among the early ones to cast their lot with the Latter-day Saints. These stalwarts in the faith performed, with others, valiant service in carrying the restored gospel to our Nation and the world.
One thing vitally needed to reinforce the missionaries was convincing literature akin to the Epistles of Paul and others of the long ago. The Book of Mormon provided basic scripture of an impelling interest; the growing Doctrine and Covenants gave living revelation for guidance and inspiration mainly of the membership. Other writings to help expound truth and light to an indifferent or scoffing world, were also essential. Experiences in the field brought Parley P. Pratt to a keen realization of this need; and he set to work with zeal to meet it. As a result, in 1837, he produced his stirring little book, Voice of Warning.
This first volume of evangelistic literature by one of the members of our Church not only braced every elder in his work but became a great missionary itself. It was a forceful reply, to begin with, for the scoffers; it met enemies of the Church on their own ground with courage; it portrayed with understanding and eloquence the meaning and message of the restored gospel. In a word, it was and is religious literature of classic quality; it lives and lasts.
Space and time do not permit any extended study here of the Voice of Warning. To get something of a mastery of this outstanding work requires reading and rereading, and in the spirit of the time and setting of its creation; but the reward in spiritual uplift and better understanding of our gospel is richly worth the study. From the viewpoint of this course—the appreciation of our literature—there are also inspirational outcomes to be gained from even a hurried perusal of this remarkable book.
One is impressed first of all with the author's mastery of the Bible. His keen analysis of the Scriptures marks him as a theologian of high attainment. His portrayal of their truths in relation to the restored gospel is of compelling and convincing character. Added to all this, the author's skill to tell a story, to write clear, straight-to-the-mark composition, to create rhythmic sentences, and to lift his message into the concrete with apt words, give literary quality of high order to his work. His prose is poetic; it lends itself to expressive oral reading.
Just a few sentences and paragraphs will serve here for illustration:
One of the greatest obstacles in the way of the spread of truth is the tide of pub-opinion (The Voice of Warning, "American Preface," XII).
Opinion and guess-work in the things of God are worse than useless; facts, well demonstrated, can alone be of service to mankind (Ibid., XVI).
During this thousand years Satan will be bound, and have no power to tempt the children of men. And the earth itself will be delivered from the curse which came by reason of the Fall.

The rough places will become smooth, the barren desert fruitful; the mountains levelled; the valleys exalted; the thorn and thistle shall no more be found, but all the earth shall yield her increase and abundance to constitute any kingdom in heaven or on earth; namely, first, a king; secondly, commissioned officers duly qualified to execute his ordinances and laws; thirdly, a code of laws by which the subjects are governed, and fourthly, subjects who are governed.... In this respect the kingdom of God is like all other kingdoms, whenever we find officers duly commissioned and qualified by the Lord Jesus, together with his ordinances and laws existing in purity, unmixed with any precepts or commandments of men, there the kingdom of God exists, and there His power is manifest, and his blessings are enjoyed as in days of old (Ibid., "The Kingdom of God," pp. 74:75). The Book of Mormon has perhaps been less understood, and more misrepresented, by the world at large than any other publication which has ever appeared (Ibid., "Origin of the American Indians," page 104). Be ye hard-hearted, ye ungodly children of men; your eyes will very soon behold him who was crucified for your sins; then shall ye see that the resurrection of the dead is a reality, something tangible, and that eternity is not a land of shades, nor a world of phantoms, as some suppose (Ibid., "The Resurrection and Restoration," page 166). From this beginning, for which the author gives to God the honor for whatever is praiseworthy in it, and pays tribute also to Joseph Smith for his inspiration and invaluable contributions, our evangelistic literature has continually been enriched through like service from others. Through pen and press we are still getting many worthy contributions to forward the spread of the restored gospel to the ends of the earth. Studies and Activities 1. What is implied by the term evangelistic literature? Cite examples of such literature used to help missionaries today. 2. Compare the various means available today in spreading the gospel with those at the time of Peter and Paul; and also with those when our Church was in its beginnings. 3. What accounts for the striking success of the earlier missionaries, despite limitations, in carrying the restored gospel to our nation and the world? 4. For the teacher: Assign to two members of the class the reading aloud expressively of the following excerpts from The Voice of Warning: a. Prophecy concerning the Savior: "Prophecy Already Fulfilled," chapter 1, beginning page 24 with words "We will now proceed to show" and ending page 25 with words "from the earth." b. As to the Book of Mormon: "Origin of the American Indian," beginning page 65 with words, "The Book of Mormon has" and ending page 66 with "Book of Mormon really is." Note not only the thought of these selections but the literary qualities of the language—clarity, movement, rhythm, word choice. 5. Be prepared, if time permits, to give other brief excerpts from writings of other early-day missionaries of special merit in proclaiming the gospel, or brief stories of the heroic carrying of the message to the world. See the biographies suggested or other like books for such words or incidents. References Autobiography and Voice of Warning by Parley P. Pratt. These for amplifying story of first missionary work, and beginnings of evangelistic literature for the promotion of this great service. A good history of the Church such as Essentials of Church History, by Joseph Fielding Smith; or Comprehensive History of the Church, by B. H. Roberts, will be of help not only in connection with this lesson, but of others in the course. Biographies such as Brigham Young, the Man and His Work, by Preston Nibley, Wilford Woodruff, by Matthias F. Cowley, and like works on our early leaders will also be helpful for human background in these studies. 780 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1948 LESSON DEPARTMENT 781 Social Science—Latter-day Saint Political Thought Lesson 4—The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General" Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, February 22, 1949 Note: A lesson is outlined for Tuesday, February 22, 1949 since some Relief Societies hold their meetings on days other than Tuesday. It is suggested that Relief Societies which meet on Tuesdays present the February 22 social science lesson on March 22 and the March 22 lesson on the fifth Tuesday, March 29, or combine the February and March social science lessons and present them together on March 22. EVAN JENSEN ECTION 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants, "A Declaration of Belief regarding Governments and Laws in General," is the work of Oliver Cowdery, "the Second Elder" of the Church in the new dispensation (Progress of Man, page 367). Objective: To study section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants as the belief of Latter-day Saints in regard to earthly governments and laws in general. The Latter-day Saint doctrine of divine authority to build a real kingdom of God on earth occasioned persecution and conflict. 'The memories of the American revolution of 1776 were still fresh in the American mind, and the American revolution had been a revolt in which the idea of divine authority in secular affairs had been repudiated. The views of the English philosopher, John Locke (1632-1704) had become very popular in the United States. In 1690 Locke had published Two Treatises on Civil Government. The first treatise was an attack on and an utter repudiation of a work written earlier by Robert Filmer, entitled Patriarcha, which contended that God ordained true government with Adam, and that priestly power to rule, or divine authority, had descended from Adam on down to the British monarchy. Devastating this argument in the first treatise, Locke's second treatise contended for popular representative government and the natural rights of man to "life, liberty, and property." Now came along Joseph Smith with a doctrine misunderstood as being similar to the odious one (in the American mind) of Filmer, with the Prophet and the Latter-day Saint Priesthood substituted (in the American mind) for the British monarch of "divine right." Joseph Smith's reconciliation of divine authority to build "the kingdom" was subsequently developed in terms of the doctrine of the divinely inspired Constitution. At a special general conference on August 17, 1835, following the approval by those assembled of the revelations to be included in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, Oliver Cowdery read an article written by himself on "Governments and Laws in General"... "which was accepted and adopted and ordered to be printed in said book" (D. H. C. II, page 247) now known as section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Why? As the printed book still states, in order "that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood..." Significance of the Declaration The Declaration regarding governments and laws is most significant. In the first place, it occupies an official position in the covenants of the Church, moved, seconded, and adopted in open meeting by the people of the Church themselves, upon the initiative of one of its members.

Not designated as a direct revelation from God, the Declaration recommended itself to the friends and enemies of the Church as a democratic statement of belief which could not be derided as emanating from outside, extramundane sources. But more RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE NOVEMBER 1948 important, in order "that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood," the Declaration may be considered the direct ancestor of the very important 12th Article of Faith, which has made it possible for missionaries to preach "the kingdom" in foreign countries without being subject to the charge that they were subversive in undermining support by their people of foreign governments: We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. Can a man divide his allegiance between kingdom-building and divine authority in a gospel embracing "all truth," with citizenship in the American, British, or any other nation? 'This was the problem. And, from the beginning, it was charged that a Latter-day Saint could not remain a good Latter-day Saint and be a loyal citizen at the same time. The "Declaration of Belief," adopted by the voice of the people August 17, 1835, is one of the first and best answers to this question and, as such, presents some of the interesting contributions Latter-day Saint experience has made to political thought. Implicit in the Declaration is the theory that both Church and State were "instituted of God for the benefit of man." When to this is added the doctrine of the inspired Constitution, a unique theory of Church-State relations (suggested in lesson three) is furnished. In general there are two theories of the proper relation of Church and State, typified by two of the great reformers who had to meet the question head-on, Luther and Calvin. In Luther's theory, the Church is subordinate to the State. In Calvin's view, the State should subordinate itself to the Church. American experience, commencing with Roger Williams, has urged the doctrine of separation of Church and State. But when separated, what is their relationship? The Latter-day Saint attitude and experience suggests the answer: their relationship is co-ordinate. Both are responsible, or should be, to God; and both are responsible to the people in building a great world society in which liberty and toleration can prevail. By this means God's kingdom can be built and, although Latter-day Saint doctrine suggests that eventually everyone will acknowledge Christ, yet everyone will have his liberty— even, said Brigham Young, "to worshipping a red dog." In case of conflict between Church and State as they pursue their twin, co-ordinate missions, the 8th section of the Doctrine and Covenants indicates (as does the Declaration) that conflicts should be reconciled by reference to that law "which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges..." This implication of co-ordinate roles and responsibilities for Church and State may be also stated as a broad social, as well as political, theory, deriving from the fundamental "facts" of (a) God's existence and (b) man's existence. Thus, all social institutions bear the same responsibility, in Latter-day Saint doctrine, as Church and State—to make a better world and assist in bringing to pass "the eternal life of man." The Declaration, of course, 783 suggests answers to the two fundamental questions of political theory (1) the nature of the State, and (2) the nature of man. The State is limited by the rights of men: We do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public and private devotion...(D. & C. 98:4). In return for the liberty granted men, and which the good State must respect, men on their part, it is explained: Are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments;... And that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience (D. & C. 98:5). This is one of the great documents of human, political experience. Full analysis of the entire Declaration will be made, step by step, point by point, in a series of lessons to follow the present survey. It is a great and significant landmark in the literature of Latter-day Saint political thought and should be read again and again. Its concluding verse (12) has significance for the "mission of America," shared by Church and State, and for world affairs: We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world... As starved, cold Europeans in destroyed cities survey their task; as civil strife rages in humanity-filled Asia; as all people survey the chasm between Communist totalitarianism and the chance afforded men to earn temporal salvation by means of God-granted liberty, we may fortify our minds with the political doctrines "adopted by unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835" (D. & C., 1921 edition, page 250). Questions for Discussion 1. In the early days of the Church it was often claimed that Latter-day Saints believed that civil government was unimportant. Church history on every page disproves this misunderstanding. In this connection, what is the especial significance of the Declaration: of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in general? The Twelfth Article of Faith? Joseph Smith's teachings concerning the United States Constitution? What experiences can the class suggest as to whether or not Latter-day Saints make good citizens? What are the two general theories of Church-State relations that have had wide acceptance in the western world? If Church and State are in conflict, is a Latter-day Saint required to choose which he should support, or does modern revelation suggest a happier solution? What is that solution? How does Latter-day Saint political theory point an important method whereby any such conflicts may be avoided? Read verses 1 and 12 of the Declaration, separately, to the class. Discuss each in the light of the foregoing lessons.

The Three are One:
Geo. A. Smith
Willard Richards
Jedediah M. Grant
John W. Young
Daniel Hanmer Wells
George A. Smith

At the October conference of 1868, George A. Smith was sustained as first counselor to President Brigham Young, succeeding Heber C. Kimball. This selection brought to the First Presidency a man of unusual ability who had already proved his worth to the Church, and whose remaining seven years were to be given to supervisory functions in the Church.

George A. Smith was born in Potsdam, New York, on June 26, 1817. He was a son of John Smith and a first cousin of Joseph the Prophet. All of his family were Congregationalists but young George could not see that this form of Christianity agreed with the scriptures, so he remained aloof from all formally organized religious bodies.

About 1830 he heard of the Book of Mormon through his uncle, Joseph Smith, Sr., who visited his home. He was convinced that it was of divine origin and two years later, in September 1832, was baptized. Moving to Ohio, he was soon sent out as a missionary and until the exodus to the West, spent much of his time engaged in missionary work, traveling extensively in the eastern part of the United States.

He faithfully kept a diary and in it is recorded the vast amount of preaching he did. Before 1870 he had delivered 3800 gospel discourses.

After the migration into the Great Basin, Elder Smith became an outstanding pioneer leader. He was a robust man of unbounded energy and soon engaged in many activities that were necessary for the establishment of the new Zion. He led the colony that established Parowan in 1851 to establish the iron industry, and assisted in the general settlement of the southern part of the Territory.

He has appropriately been called the "Father of the Southern Settlements." So affectionately was he regarded in that area that the city of St. George was named in his honor.

Politically, he served as a territorial delegate to Congress at Washington, D.C., and assisted in forming the Provisional State of Deseret. He was a member of the territorial legislature in every session between 1850 and 1870, with the exception of one year spent in Congress.

LESSON DEPARTMENT John W. Young

When George A. Smith departed this life, the vacancy in the Presidency was filled by John W. Young, a son of Brigham Young.

This young man was born at Nauvoo in 1844 and was ordained an apostle by his father in 1864, but never became a member of the Council of the Twelve. He was interested in industrial pursuits, particularly in the construction and maintenance of railroads which in this era were beginning to enter the West.

In 1866 the plans for a railroad to the Pacific, with its possible arterial branches serving the intermountain territory, made it apparent that a new era was about to dawn upon the Church that would end the saints' economic, religious, and social isolation. The Church leaders planned branch roads to serve the various settlements, and were in need of competent advice.

Brigham Young chose his son John as a special counselor to him in this capacity in the late sixties, and in 1875 set him apart as his first counselor. He functioned in this capacity until his father's death in August 1877, after which for several years he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles.

He later moved to New York City where he engaged in railroad management.

Willard Richards

As Brigham Young was assisted by three first counselors during his administration, he similarly had the assistance of three second counselors. The first of these was Willard Richards, who was born in Massachusetts on June 24, 1804. His family were Congregationalists but Willard never formally joined any church.

He became a successful practicing physician and in the summer of 1835 saw a copy of the Book of Mormon which Brigham Young had left with his cousin near Boston. Willard read a portion of it and declared, "God or the devil has had a hand in that book, for man never wrote it."

He journeyed to Kirtland the next year and, in December 1836, was baptized. He accompanied Heber C. Kimball to open the British Mission in 1837 and remained there as one of its presidency until 1841, having the unique distinction of having been ordained an apostle in England in 1840.

At Nauvoo he was one of the outstanding men in its public life, holding the office of temple recorder, clerk of the Church, private secretary to Joseph Smith, clerk of the town council and clerk of the municipal court. He was with the Prophet in Carthage Jail when he was martyred.

Brigham Young chose him as his second counselor in December, 1847 and in that capacity he became the member of the Presidency who assumed much of the clerical and financial phases of Church administration. It was a great change from the calling of a New England physician to the duties he assumed in Salt Lake City. He was Secretary of State in the Provisional State of Deseret; a member of the territorial legislature; postmaster of Salt Lake City; manager of the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company; general Church Historian; and proprietor and editor of the Deseret News, the first newspaper in the intermountain area, which he established in 1850. His premature death in 1854 brought to a close a career that had.

Under the inspiration of God, given Brigham Young valuable help in organizing and administering the great migration of the saints to the West, and their organization into permanent groups to build the kingdom of Jedediah M. Grant.

The man whom Brigham Young selected to succeed Willard Richards was Jedediah M. Grant, a man very unlike his predecessor in office. Fi. Der Grant was born in Windsor, New York, February 21, 1816, and had joined the Church in 1833. During his early years in the Church he spent most of his time in missionary work and gained a reputation as a great gospel preacher and an unusually able scriptorian. He it was who opened the Southern States Mission of the Church.

In October 1847, he arrived in Salt Lake Valley. When the city was incorporated he was elected its first mayor, which position he continued to hold until his death. He was also a member of the territorial legislature. At the April conference in 1854, he was ordained an apostle and sustained as the second counselor to Brigham Young. For the next two and a half years his energies were spent in promoting what is commonly called "The Reformation." The saints had become so engrossed in their struggle to wrest their sustenance from the parched earth that some had seemed to forget that it was their religion that had been the cause of their going into the West. President Grant literally wore himself out physically, through his strenuous efforts to get the people to see the vital values in life. As a result of his efforts, there was a universal revival of spiritual life and energy, such as the saints had never before witnessed in the Church.

This calling of the people to repentance had a lasting effect upon the Church membership and resulted in a renewed interest in missionary work to the nations of the world. His early death—forty years of age—probably resulted from overwork in this cause. Coupled with his vigor and uncompromising battle against slothfulness and "backsliding" as he termed it, Jedediah M. Grant had a compassion for all who suffered. He died at Salt Lake City on December 1, 1856, nine days after the birth of his son, Heber J. Grant, who became the seventh President of the Church.

Daniel Hanmer Wells The third of Brigham Young's second counselors, was Daniel Hanmer Wells, who was born in Trenton, New York, October 27, 1814. In 1833 he had moved to Commerce (later Nauvoo), where he was a large landholder and prominent in civic affairs. He dealt kindly with the saints who had been driven from Missouri, and although not a member of the Church, was treated as one of their number and was elected to the office of town councilman and appointed a brigadier-general in the Nauvoo Legion. When the saints were forced to leave Nauvoo he decided to cast his lot with them, although had he remained he undoubtedly would have become wealthy from the spoils of their labors. His baptism took place in Nauvoo in 1846. He arrived in Utah in 1848.

There he became active in the territorial militia, taking part in the campaigns against the Indians with marked success, and carrying to a successful conclusion the "bloodless war" with Johnston's Army in 1857 and 1858. On being ordained an apostle and set apart as second counselor to Brigham Young, January 4, 1857, he took over the supervision of public works, an essential portion of the economy of the Church, which provided employment for the immigrants during the adjustment period between their arrival in the Valley and the beginning of their agricultural or manufacturing pursuits. He likewise visited the many settlements of the saints and in 1876 visited the newly founded colonies of saints in Arizona, giving them counsel and inspirational advice.

The death of Brigham Young released him from his office, but he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles. In this capacity he served as president of the European Missions and ended his days as president of the Manti temple. He died March 24, 1891.

Topics for Discussion 1.

What evidence can you present to show that God inspired Brigham Young to choose his counselors because the Church had need for the talents they possessed? 

2. What evidence can you find that these men grew, under the power of their calling, to meet the needs of the Church and its members?

3. What do you suppose caused Willard Richards to make the remark he did about the Book of Mormon when he first commenced to read it?

4. How do you account for the fact that so many of the early Church leaders were converted to the restored gospel by the Book of Mormon, even before they had seen Joseph Smith?

5. Read the two accounts of Jedediah M. Grant's preaching in the Southern States, as given on pages 59 and 60 of 791 Jenson's L.D.S. Biographical Encyclopedia.

From Near and Far
Sadie Ollerton Clark, author of "Then � � and Now," is the wife of Leigh W. Clark, Houston, Texas. She is the mother of three sons and president of the Houston Branch Relief Society. She began writing while attending Brigham Young University. Her literary work is distinguished by clarity and beauty of language and a deep insight into character and personality. Many of our readers will recall with pleasure her delightful pioneer poem "To My Mother" which was awarded first honorable mention in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest in 1936.
Mrs. Clark and her husband have been active leaders in several wards and branches of the Church — including Mesa (Arizona), Albuquerque (New Mexico), and El Paso (Texas), where they have welcomed many missionaries and converts to the Church.

I appreciate having The Relief Society Magazine for a year so that I might know more about the Mormon faith and its many fine works.
Mildred Chatfield Smith, Watertown, Mass.

I enjoy my work in contacting the women (as Magazine representative) and find that the Magazine sells itself. Also I enjoy it for it fills all my needs.
Emma J. Lines, Duncan, Arizona.

Enclosed find check for the coming year's subscription to the Magazine. We can't do without it in our home.
I want to express my sincere thanks to Carol Read Flake for her excellent story "Sudden Storm" in the September issue. May she write more stories of this high caliber.
Success to you and all your helpers on this our own ladies' Magazine.
Frances Yost, Bancroft, Idaho.

I find The Relief Society Magazine a great help and inspiration in my missionary work and I want it for myself even though I am a man. I heartily recommend it to all missionaries.
Elder Frank Harold Wing, Louisville, Kentucky.

You may be interested to know that I visited several of the families that I have been sending the Magazine to. They are all non-members, and each one praised the Magazine very highly, saying they passed it on to friends and relatives when they had finished reading it. It was the means of a good many interesting gospel conversations.
Una McDonald, Las Vegas, Nevada.

"The Visitors" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) is a fascinating story. It reveals unusual ability to portray human behavior patterns truthfully and entertainingly. To my delight I find no flaws in her portrayals, no confusion of traits, not one tiny slip out of character, and I knew intimately the two dear women she describes so charmingly.
I predict for Mrs. Tarlock a brilliant career in the realm of homey stories.
Estelle Neff Caldwell, Los Angeles, California.

The sisters here in Glasgow (Scotland) appreciate the Relief Society Magazine and send their best wishes for its continued success.
Ellen Martin.

The current feature in the Relief Society Magazine, "The Russells Did Not Go to Church," (August, September, and October) is unusually good.
Fay Tarlock, Danville, California.

I love our Magazine and would not think of being without it. You are doing a grand work.
Irene K. Read, Boise, Idaho.

I am eighty years old and I have always enjoyed The Relief Society Magazine. Success for the Magazine.
Marietta S. Porter, Myton, Utah.

We did so much enjoy the fine story in the September issue of The Relief Society Magazine, "Learn of Love" by Rosa Lee Lloyd.
