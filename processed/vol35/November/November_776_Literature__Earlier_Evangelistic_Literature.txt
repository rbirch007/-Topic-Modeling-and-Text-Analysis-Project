Earlier Evangelistic Literature Elder Howard R. Driggs

For Tuesday, February 15, 1949

FERVOR to share the enriched truths of the restored gospel—to radiate its glorious new light—naturally brought some stirring evangelistic literature. Missionaries, as soon as the Church had been organized, were sent forth. Not only did they voice the glad tidings whenever they found folk to listen, but gradually they used pen and press to spread the newly revealed word of God farther and wider. It was all impelled by a desire to share—to keep the good things that had come by giving them to others. Indeed one can keep the gospel bright and beautiful only by sharing it. Zeal to do this vibrates through the writings of those earlier missionaries. It still does in the work of today.

Two things, however, seem to add to the intensity of the early-day earnestness: first, the nearness to the Prophet and to the divine drama of the restoration; second, the testing hardships and bitter persecution that had to be met and overcome. We are brought closer to all this in the Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, one of the outstanding missionaries who lived through those soul-searching, early-day experiences.

With Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, and Ziba Peterson, Parley was on the first official mission—this to the Lamanites on the Missouri frontier. A few paragraphs from his Autobiography, a volume of high literary merit, will help make the story live again.

The four elders, after traveling afoot for hundreds of miles, and meeting with outstanding success in converting folk in and around Kirtland, Ohio, finally found themselves in Illinois, where they were halted, "by a dreadful storm of rain and snow, which lasted for a week or more. Although in the midst of strangers," writes Elder Pratt, "we were kindly entertained, found many friends, and preached to large congregations in several neighborhoods."

His story continues:

In the beginning of 1831 we renewed our journey; and passing through St. Louis and St. Charles, we travelled on foot for three hundred miles through vast prairies and through trackless wilds of snow—no beaten road; houses few and far between; and the bleak northwest wind always blowing in our faces with a keenness which would almost take the skin off the face. We travelled for whole days, from morning till night, without a house or fire, wading in snow to the knees at every step. . . . We carried on our backs our changes of clothing, several books, and corn bread and raw pork. We often ate our frozen bread and pork by the way, when the bread would be so frozen that we could not bite or penetrate any part of it but the outside crust (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, chapter VII).

On reaching Independence—gateway town to the untamed West—two of the elders found employment as tailors to help, while Oliver Cowdery and Parley P. Pratt crossed the frontier line and commenced a mission among the Indians. The first night was passed with the Shawnees, then the elders went over the Kansas River to work among the Delawares. There they found the principal chief—"a venerable looking man" held in reverence as "the great-grandfather, or Sachem of ten nations or tribes." The two missionaries were made welcome by this Indian leader; and after he learned, through an interpreter, of their errand, particularly something of the Bible they brought, he called a council. Oliver Cowdery then addressed the red men. His words, as recorded by Elder Pratt, in part, follow:

Thousands of moons ago, when the red men's forefathers dwelt in peace and possessed this whole land, the Great Spirit talked with them, and revealed His law and His will, and much knowledge to their wise men and prophets. This they wrote in a Book; together with their history, and the things which should befall their children in the latter days.

This Book was written on plates of gold, and handed down from father to son for many ages and generations.

It was then that the people prospered, and were strong and mighty; they cultivated the earth; built buildings and cities, and abounded in all good things, as the pale faces now do.

But they became wicked; they killed one another and shed much blood; they killed their prophets . . . and sought to destroy the Book. The Great Spirit became angry, and would speak to them no more ....
This Book, which contained these things, was hid in the earth by Moroni, in a hill called by him, Cumorah ....
In that neighborhood there lived a young man named Joseph Smith, who prayed to the Great Spirit much, in order that he might know the truth; and the Great Spirit sent an angel to him, and told him where this Book was hid by Moroni; and commanded him to go and get it. He accordingly went to the place, and dug in the earth, and found the Book written on gold plates.
But it was written in the language of the forefathers of the red man; therefore this young man, being a pale face, could not understand it; but the angel told him and showed him, and gave him a knowledge of the language and how to interpret the Book. So he interpreted it into the language of the pale faces, and wrote it on paper, and caused it to be printed ....

So we have now come from him, and here is a copy of the Book, which we now present to our red friend, the chief of the Delawares, and which we hope he will cause to be read and known among his tribe; it will do them good.
Observe here, how Oliver Cowdery, with teaching skill, meets the minds of his listeners simply, concretely, and in terms the Indians could understand. This is real literary art. It was in a dramatic setting—worthy of portrayal by a gifted painter.
The response of the Indian chief is likewise picturesque and touching:
We feel truly thankful to our white friends who have come so far, and been at such pains to tell us good news, and especially this new news concerning the Book of our forefathers; it makes us glad in here (placing his hand on his heart).
It is now winter, we are new settlers in this place; the snow is deep, our cattle and horses are dying; our wigwams are poor; we have much to do in the spring—to build houses, and fence and make farms; but we will build a council house, and meet together, and you shall read to us and teach us more concerning the Book of our fathers and the will of the Great Spirit (Ibid., chapter VIII).
These good intentions unfortunately could not be carried out. Rising interest on the part of the Indians in Mormonism brought immediate opposition to missionary work among them. Indian agents, stirred doubtless by sectarian enmity, ordered our elders, with threat of using military force, off the reservation.
The elders left to continue their work for a time around Independence. It is interesting to note that the very same year our Latter-day Saint missionaries were trying to carry the restored gospel to the Indians, 1831, four chieftains from the farther Northwest came down the Missouri River to St. Louis seeking what they called "The White Man's Book of Heaven." Two of these red men died that winter in the frontier city; the other two returned to their people in the wilds, disappointed; they had been given gifts enough, as one of them said, "to make our moccasins heavy," but the light of the gospel they sought had not been given to them. Their people must still "sit in darkness." Had the Latter-day Saint missionaries been permitted to carry forward their work, the desire of the red men for light and truth might at the time have been splendidly gratified.
Although this first mission of our four young elders, so far as the Indians were concerned, was thwarted, there was rich fruitage from it elsewhere. Not alone in Kirtland, where a religious leader, Sidney Rigdon, and practically his whole congregation, joined the Latter-day Saints, but elsewhere along their route, the elders gathered hundreds into the fold. It was the beginning of a great missionary work, leading to the calling of many others into the service of spreading the gospel far and wide.
All of this zeal was inspired by the Prophet, who gave himself untiringly to the labor of love for mankind. His devoted brother Samuel had pioneered the carrying of the gospel into the wider field when he went forth alone to try to sell the Book of Mormon. Though generally rebuffed and unwelcomed on his humble mission, Samuel did place one copy of the Book where it reached Brigham Young, and through him, Heber C. Kimball. A first convert made by Parley P. Pratt was his own brother Orson. Later, in Canada, he also brought John Taylor into the fold. George A. Smith, a cousin to the Prophet and grandfather of our President George Albert Smith, and another leader Wilford Woodruff, were also among the early ones to cast their lot with the Latter-day Saints. These stalwarts in the faith performed, with others, valiant service in carrying the restored gospel to our Nation and the world.
One thing vitally needed to reinforce the missionaries was convincing literature akin to the Epistles of Paul and others of the long ago. The Book of Mormon provided basic scripture of an impelling interest; the growing Doctrine and Covenants gave living revelation for guidance and inspiration mainly of the membership. Other writings to help expound truth and light to an indifferent or scoffing world, were also essential. Experiences in the field brought Parley P. Pratt to a keen realization of this need; and he set to work with zeal to meet it. As a result, in 1837, he produced his stirring little book, Voice of Warning.
This first volume of evangelistic literature by one of the members of our Church not only braced every elder in his work but became a great missionary itself. It was a forceful reply, to begin with, for the scoffers; it met enemies of the Church on their own ground with courage; it portrayed with understanding and eloquence the meaning and message of the restored gospel. In a word, it was and is religious literature of classic quality; it lives and lasts.
Space and time do not permit any extended study here of the Voice of Warning. To get something of a mastery of this outstanding work requires reading and rereading, and in the spirit of the time and setting of its creation; but the reward in spiritual uplift and better understanding of our gospel is richly worth the study. From the viewpoint of this course—the appreciation of our literature—there are also inspirational outcomes to be gained from even a hurried perusal of this remarkable book.
One is impressed first of all with the author's mastery of the Bible. His keen analysis of the Scriptures marks him as a theologian of high attainment. His portrayal of their truths in relation to the restored gospel is of compelling and convincing character. Added to all this, the author's skill to tell a story, to write clear, straight-to-the-mark composition, to create rhythmic sentences, and to lift his message into the concrete with apt words, give literary quality of high order to his work. His prose is poetic; it lends itself to expressive oral reading.
Just a few sentences and paragraphs will serve here for illustration:
One of the greatest obstacles in the way of the spread of truth is the tide of pub-opinion (The Voice of Warning, "American Preface," XII).
Opinion and guess-work in the things of God are worse than useless; facts, well demonstrated, can alone be of service to mankind (Ibid., XVI).
During this thousand years Satan will be bound, and have no power to tempt the children of men. And the earth itself will be delivered from the curse which came by reason of the Fall.

The rough places will become smooth, the barren desert fruitful; the mountains levelled; the valleys exalted; the thorn and thistle shall no more be found, but all the earth shall yield her increase and abundance to constitute any kingdom in heaven or on earth; namely, first, a king; secondly, commissioned officers duly qualified to execute his ordinances and laws; thirdly, a code of laws by which the subjects are governed, and fourthly, subjects who are governed.... In this respect the kingdom of God is like all other kingdoms, whenever we find officers duly commissioned and qualified by the Lord Jesus, together with his ordinances and laws existing in purity, unmixed with any precepts or commandments of men, there the kingdom of God exists, and there His power is manifest, and his blessings are enjoyed as in days of old (Ibid., "The Kingdom of God," pp. 74:75). The Book of Mormon has perhaps been less understood, and more misrepresented, by the world at large than any other publication which has ever appeared (Ibid., "Origin of the American Indians," page 104). Be ye hard-hearted, ye ungodly children of men; your eyes will very soon behold him who was crucified for your sins; then shall ye see that the resurrection of the dead is a reality, something tangible, and that eternity is not a land of shades, nor a world of phantoms, as some suppose (Ibid., "The Resurrection and Restoration," page 166). From this beginning, for which the author gives to God the honor for whatever is praiseworthy in it, and pays tribute also to Joseph Smith for his inspiration and invaluable contributions, our evangelistic literature has continually been enriched through like service from others. Through pen and press we are still getting many worthy contributions to forward the spread of the restored gospel to the ends of the earth. Studies and Activities 1. What is implied by the term evangelistic literature? Cite examples of such literature used to help missionaries today. 2. Compare the various means available today in spreading the gospel with those at the time of Peter and Paul; and also with those when our Church was in its beginnings. 3. What accounts for the striking success of the earlier missionaries, despite limitations, in carrying the restored gospel to our nation and the world? 4. For the teacher: Assign to two members of the class the reading aloud expressively of the following excerpts from The Voice of Warning: a. Prophecy concerning the Savior: "Prophecy Already Fulfilled," chapter 1, beginning page 24 with words "We will now proceed to show" and ending page 25 with words "from the earth." b. As to the Book of Mormon: "Origin of the American Indian," beginning page 65 with words, "The Book of Mormon has" and ending page 66 with "Book of Mormon really is." Note not only the thought of these selections but the literary qualities of the language—clarity, movement, rhythm, word choice. 5. Be prepared, if time permits, to give other brief excerpts from writings of other early-day missionaries of special merit in proclaiming the gospel, or brief stories of the heroic carrying of the message to the world. See the biographies suggested or other like books for such words or incidents. References Autobiography and Voice of Warning by Parley P. Pratt. These for amplifying story of first missionary work, and beginnings of evangelistic literature for the promotion of this great service. A good history of the Church such as Essentials of Church History, by Joseph Fielding Smith; or Comprehensive History of the Church, by B. H. Roberts, will be of help not only in connection with this lesson, but of others in the course. Biographies such as Brigham Young, the Man and His Work, by Preston Nibley, Wilford Woodruff, by Matthias F. Cowley, and like works on our early leaders will also be helpful for human background in these studies. 780 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—NOVEMBER 1948 LESSON DEPARTMENT 781 Social Science—Latter-day Saint Political Thought Lesson 4—The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General" Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, February 22, 1949 Note: A lesson is outlined for Tuesday, February 22, 1949 since some Relief Societies hold their meetings on days other than Tuesday. It is suggested that Relief Societies which meet on Tuesdays present the February 22 social science lesson on March 22 and the March 22 lesson on the fifth Tuesday, March 29, or combine the February and March social science lessons and present them together on March 22. EVAN JENSEN ECTION 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants, "A Declaration of Belief regarding Governments and Laws in General," is the work of Oliver Cowdery, "the Second Elder" of the Church in the new dispensation (Progress of Man, page 367). Objective: To study section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants as the belief of Latter-day Saints in regard to earthly governments and laws in general. The Latter-day Saint doctrine of divine authority to build a real kingdom of God on earth occasioned persecution and conflict. 'The memories of the American revolution of 1776 were still fresh in the American mind, and the American revolution had been a revolt in which the idea of divine authority in secular affairs had been repudiated. The views of the English philosopher, John Locke (1632-1704) had become very popular in the United States. In 1690 Locke had published Two Treatises on Civil Government. The first treatise was an attack on and an utter repudiation of a work written earlier by Robert Filmer, entitled Patriarcha, which contended that God ordained true government with Adam, and that priestly power to rule, or divine authority, had descended from Adam on down to the British monarchy. Devastating this argument in the first treatise, Locke's second treatise contended for popular representative government and the natural rights of man to "life, liberty, and property." Now came along Joseph Smith with a doctrine misunderstood as being similar to the odious one (in the American mind) of Filmer, with the Prophet and the Latter-day Saint Priesthood substituted (in the American mind) for the British monarch of "divine right." Joseph Smith's reconciliation of divine authority to build "the kingdom" was subsequently developed in terms of the doctrine of the divinely inspired Constitution. At a special general conference on August 17, 1835, following the approval by those assembled of the revelations to be included in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, Oliver Cowdery read an article written by himself on "Governments and Laws in General"... "which was accepted and adopted and ordered to be printed in said book" (D. H. C. II, page 247) now known as section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Why? As the printed book still states, in order "that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood..." Significance of the Declaration The Declaration regarding governments and laws is most significant. In the first place, it occupies an official position in the covenants of the Church, moved, seconded, and adopted in open meeting by the people of the Church themselves, upon the initiative of one of its members.

Not designated as a direct revelation from God, the Declaration recommended itself to the friends and enemies of the Church as a democratic statement of belief which could not be derided as emanating from outside, extramundane sources. But more RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE NOVEMBER 1948 important, in order "that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood," the Declaration may be considered the direct ancestor of the very important 12th Article of Faith, which has made it possible for missionaries to preach "the kingdom" in foreign countries without being subject to the charge that they were subversive in undermining support by their people of foreign governments: We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. Can a man divide his allegiance between kingdom-building and divine authority in a gospel embracing "all truth," with citizenship in the American, British, or any other nation? 'This was the problem. And, from the beginning, it was charged that a Latter-day Saint could not remain a good Latter-day Saint and be a loyal citizen at the same time. The "Declaration of Belief," adopted by the voice of the people August 17, 1835, is one of the first and best answers to this question and, as such, presents some of the interesting contributions Latter-day Saint experience has made to political thought. Implicit in the Declaration is the theory that both Church and State were "instituted of God for the benefit of man." When to this is added the doctrine of the inspired Constitution, a unique theory of Church-State relations (suggested in lesson three) is furnished. In general there are two theories of the proper relation of Church and State, typified by two of the great reformers who had to meet the question head-on, Luther and Calvin. In Luther's theory, the Church is subordinate to the State. In Calvin's view, the State should subordinate itself to the Church. American experience, commencing with Roger Williams, has urged the doctrine of separation of Church and State. But when separated, what is their relationship? The Latter-day Saint attitude and experience suggests the answer: their relationship is co-ordinate. Both are responsible, or should be, to God; and both are responsible to the people in building a great world society in which liberty and toleration can prevail. By this means God's kingdom can be built and, although Latter-day Saint doctrine suggests that eventually everyone will acknowledge Christ, yet everyone will have his liberty— even, said Brigham Young, "to worshipping a red dog." In case of conflict between Church and State as they pursue their twin, co-ordinate missions, the 8th section of the Doctrine and Covenants indicates (as does the Declaration) that conflicts should be reconciled by reference to that law "which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges..." This implication of co-ordinate roles and responsibilities for Church and State may be also stated as a broad social, as well as political, theory, deriving from the fundamental "facts" of (a) God's existence and (b) man's existence. Thus, all social institutions bear the same responsibility, in Latter-day Saint doctrine, as Church and State—to make a better world and assist in bringing to pass "the eternal life of man." The Declaration, of course, 783 suggests answers to the two fundamental questions of political theory (1) the nature of the State, and (2) the nature of man. The State is limited by the rights of men: We do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public and private devotion...(D. & C. 98:4). In return for the liberty granted men, and which the good State must respect, men on their part, it is explained: Are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments;... And that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience (D. & C. 98:5). This is one of the great documents of human, political experience. Full analysis of the entire Declaration will be made, step by step, point by point, in a series of lessons to follow the present survey. It is a great and significant landmark in the literature of Latter-day Saint political thought and should be read again and again. Its concluding verse (12) has significance for the "mission of America," shared by Church and State, and for world affairs: We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world... As starved, cold Europeans in destroyed cities survey their task; as civil strife rages in humanity-filled Asia; as all people survey the chasm between Communist totalitarianism and the chance afforded men to earn temporal salvation by means of God-granted liberty, we may fortify our minds with the political doctrines "adopted by unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835" (D. & C., 1921 edition, page 250). Questions for Discussion 1. In the early days of the Church it was often claimed that Latter-day Saints believed that civil government was unimportant. Church history on every page disproves this misunderstanding. In this connection, what is the especial significance of the Declaration: of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in general? The Twelfth Article of Faith? Joseph Smith's teachings concerning the United States Constitution? What experiences can the class suggest as to whether or not Latter-day Saints make good citizens? What are the two general theories of Church-State relations that have had wide acceptance in the western world? If Church and State are in conflict, is a Latter-day Saint required to choose which he should support, or does modern revelation suggest a happier solution? What is that solution? How does Latter-day Saint political theory point an important method whereby any such conflicts may be avoided? Read verses 1 and 12 of the Declaration, separately, to the class. Discuss each in the light of the foregoing lessons. DESERT DUSK Grace Zenor Pratt A desert glorified by shades of blue and violet, Of lavender and mauve, meeting the evening sky All rose and saffron...

The Three are One:
Geo. A. Smith
Willard Richards
Jedediah M. Grant
John W. Young
Daniel Hanmer Wells
George A. Smith

At the October conference of 1868, George A. Smith was sustained as first counselor to President Brigham Young, succeeding Heber C. Kimball. This selection brought to the First Presidency a man of unusual ability who had already proved his worth to the Church, and whose remaining seven years were to be given to supervisory functions in the Church.

George A. Smith was born in Potsdam, New York, on June 26, 1817. He was a son of John Smith and a first cousin of Joseph the Prophet. All of his family were Congregationalists but young George could not see that this form of Christianity agreed with the scriptures, so he remained aloof from all formally organized religious bodies.

About 1830 he heard of the Book of Mormon through his uncle, Joseph Smith, Sr., who visited his home. He was convinced that it was of divine origin and two years later, in September 1832, was baptized. Moving to Ohio, he was soon sent out as a missionary and until the exodus to the West, spent much of his time engaged in missionary work, traveling extensively in the eastern part of the United States.

He faithfully kept a diary and in it is recorded the vast amount of preaching he did. Before 1870 he had delivered 3800 gospel discourses.

After the migration into the Great Basin, Elder Smith became an outstanding pioneer leader. He was a robust man of unbounded energy and soon engaged in many activities that were necessary for the establishment of the new Zion. He led the colony that established Parowan in 1851 to establish the iron industry, and assisted in the general settlement of the southern part of the Territory.

He has appropriately been called the "Father of the Southern Settlements." So affectionately was he regarded in that area that the city of St. George was named in his honor.

Politically, he served as a territorial delegate to Congress at Washington, D.C., and assisted in forming the Provisional State of Deseret. He was a member of the territorial legislature in every session between 1850 and 1870, with the exception of one year spent in Congress.

LESSON DEPARTMENT John W. Young

When George A. Smith departed this life, the vacancy in the Presidency was filled by John W. Young, a son of Brigham Young.

This young man was born at Nauvoo in 1844 and was ordained an apostle by his father in 1864, but never became a member of the Council of the Twelve. He was interested in industrial pursuits, particularly in the construction and maintenance of railroads which in this era were beginning to enter the West.

In 1866 the plans for a railroad to the Pacific, with its possible arterial branches serving the intermountain territory, made it apparent that a new era was about to dawn upon the Church that would end the saints' economic, religious, and social isolation. The Church leaders planned branch roads to serve the various settlements, and were in need of competent advice.

Brigham Young chose his son John as a special counselor to him in this capacity in the late sixties, and in 1875 set him apart as his first counselor. He functioned in this capacity until his father's death in August 1877, after which for several years he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles.

He later moved to New York City where he engaged in railroad management.

Willard Richards

As Brigham Young was assisted by three first counselors during his administration, he similarly had the assistance of three second counselors. The first of these was Willard Richards, who was born in Massachusetts on June 24, 1804. His family were Congregationalists but Willard never formally joined any church.

He became a successful practicing physician and in the summer of 1835 saw a copy of the Book of Mormon which Brigham Young had left with his cousin near Boston. Willard read a portion of it and declared, "God or the devil has had a hand in that book, for man never wrote it."

He journeyed to Kirtland the next year and, in December 1836, was baptized. He accompanied Heber C. Kimball to open the British Mission in 1837 and remained there as one of its presidency until 1841, having the unique distinction of having been ordained an apostle in England in 1840.

At Nauvoo he was one of the outstanding men in its public life, holding the office of temple recorder, clerk of the Church, private secretary to Joseph Smith, clerk of the town council and clerk of the municipal court. He was with the Prophet in Carthage Jail when he was martyred.

Brigham Young chose him as his second counselor in December, 1847 and in that capacity he became the member of the Presidency who assumed much of the clerical and financial phases of Church administration. It was a great change from the calling of a New England physician to the duties he assumed in Salt Lake City. He was Secretary of State in the Provisional State of Deseret; a member of the territorial legislature; postmaster of Salt Lake City; manager of the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company; general Church Historian; and proprietor and editor of the Deseret News, the first newspaper in the intermountain area, which he established in 1850. His premature death in 1854 brought to a close a career that had.

Under the inspiration of God, given Brigham Young valuable help in organizing and administering the great migration of the saints to the West, and their organization into permanent groups to build the kingdom of Jedediah M. Grant.

The man whom Brigham Young selected to succeed Willard Richards was Jedediah M. Grant, a man very unlike his predecessor in office. Fi. Der Grant was born in Windsor, New York, February 21, 1816, and had joined the Church in 1833. During his early years in the Church he spent most of his time in missionary work and gained a reputation as a great gospel preacher and an unusually able scriptorian. He it was who opened the Southern States Mission of the Church.

In October 1847, he arrived in Salt Lake Valley. When the city was incorporated he was elected its first mayor, which position he continued to hold until his death. He was also a member of the territorial legislature. At the April conference in 1854, he was ordained an apostle and sustained as the second counselor to Brigham Young. For the next two and a half years his energies were spent in promoting what is commonly called "The Reformation." The saints had become so engrossed in their struggle to wrest their sustenance from the parched earth that some had seemed to forget that it was their religion that had been the cause of their going into the West. President Grant literally wore himself out physically, through his strenuous efforts to get the people to see the vital values in life. As a result of his efforts, there was a universal revival of spiritual life and energy, such as the saints had never before witnessed in the Church.

This calling of the people to repentance had a lasting effect upon the Church membership and resulted in a renewed interest in missionary work to the nations of the world. His early death—forty years of age—probably resulted from overwork in this cause. Coupled with his vigor and uncompromising battle against slothfulness and "backsliding" as he termed it, Jedediah M. Grant had a compassion for all who suffered. He died at Salt Lake City on December 1, 1856, nine days after the birth of his son, Heber J. Grant, who became the seventh President of the Church.

Daniel Hanmer Wells The third of Brigham Young's second counselors, was Daniel Hanmer Wells, who was born in Trenton, New York, October 27, 1814. In 1833 he had moved to Commerce (later Nauvoo), where he was a large landholder and prominent in civic affairs. He dealt kindly with the saints who had been driven from Missouri, and although not a member of the Church, was treated as one of their number and was elected to the office of town councilman and appointed a brigadier-general in the Nauvoo Legion. When the saints were forced to leave Nauvoo he decided to cast his lot with them, although had he remained he undoubtedly would have become wealthy from the spoils of their labors. His baptism took place in Nauvoo in 1846. He arrived in Utah in 1848.

There he became active in the territorial militia, taking part in the campaigns against the Indians with marked success, and carrying to a successful conclusion the "bloodless war" with Johnston's Army in 1857 and 1858. On being ordained an apostle and set apart as second counselor to Brigham Young, January 4, 1857, he took over the supervision of public works, an essential portion of the economy of the Church, which provided employment for the immigrants during the adjustment period between their arrival in the Valley and the beginning of their agricultural or manufacturing pursuits. He likewise visited the many settlements of the saints and in 1876 visited the newly founded colonies of saints in Arizona, giving them counsel and inspirational advice.

The death of Brigham Young released him from his office, but he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles. In this capacity he served as president of the European Missions and ended his days as president of the Manti temple. He died March 24, 1891.

Topics for Discussion 1.

What evidence can you present to show that God inspired Brigham Young to choose his counselors because the Church had need for the talents they possessed? 

2. What evidence can you find that these men grew, under the power of their calling, to meet the needs of the Church and its members?

3. What do you suppose caused Willard Richards to make the remark he did about the Book of Mormon when he first commenced to read it?

4. How do you account for the fact that so many of the early Church leaders were converted to the restored gospel by the Book of Mormon, even before they had seen Joseph Smith?

5. Read the two accounts of Jedediah M. Grant's preaching in the Southern States, as given on pages 59 and 60 of 791 Jenson's L.D.S. Biographical Encyclopedia.

From Near and Far
Sadie Ollerton Clark, author of "Then � � and Now," is the wife of Leigh W. Clark, Houston, Texas. She is the mother of three sons and president of the Houston Branch Relief Society. She began writing while attending Brigham Young University. Her literary work is distinguished by clarity and beauty of language and a deep insight into character and personality. Many of our readers will recall with pleasure her delightful pioneer poem "To My Mother" which was awarded first honorable mention in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest in 1936.
Mrs. Clark and her husband have been active leaders in several wards and branches of the Church — including Mesa (Arizona), Albuquerque (New Mexico), and El Paso (Texas), where they have welcomed many missionaries and converts to the Church.

You may be interested to know that I visited several of the families that I have been sending the Magazine to. They are all non-members, and each one praised the Magazine very highly, saying they passed it on to friends and relatives when they had finished reading it. It was the means of a good many interesting gospel conversations.
Una McDonald, Las Vegas, Nevada.

"The Visitors" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) is a fascinating story. It reveals unusual ability to portray human behavior patterns truthfully and entertainingly. To my delight I find no flaws in her portrayals, no confusion of traits, not one tiny slip out of character, and I knew intimately the two dear women she describes so charmingly.
I predict for Mrs. Tarlock a brilliant career in the realm of homey stories.
Estelle Neff Caldwell, Los Angeles, California.

The sisters here in Glasgow (Scotland) appreciate the Relief Society Magazine and send their best wishes for its continued success.

The current feature in the Relief Society Magazine, "The Russells Did Not Go to Church," (August, September, and October) is unusually good.
