Jess H. Rolph [Prepared for the Utah Division, American Cancer Society]

Many people know what cancer is, yet one person out of every eight in the United States dies from it, or as a result of its deadly action.
True, there are many unanswered questions about cancer, many false notions concerning it, but, thanks to the work of the American Cancer Society, there is much we do know. It is not a disease that is infectious, nor does it enter the body from the outside, but, like the stealthy sneak it is, it comes from within!

Cancer has been defined as a group of normal body cells that start abnormal growth, pushing aside the other cells in their ruthless conquest of the body. Though the causes of cancer are varied, it is known that it never develops in healthy body tissue.

For example, irregularity of eating does not cause cancer, but it may result in unhealthy conditions within the digestive system, which sooner or later give rise to it.
One half of all cases of cancer are found in the digestive tract; approximately one-third are in the stomach. One factor in the development of this disease is continual or chronic irritation. It is as though the cells of some body tissue lose patience, break into open revolution, and begin building up their rebel army through cell division.

There are three types of irritants: chemical, thermal, and mechanical.
Over-exposure to hot sun and high temperatures may be the cause of skin cancer. Constant rubbing of a mole, wart, or old scar may be sufficient mechanical irritation to cause rebellion and growth of malignant tissue.

Certain people are more susceptible to cancer. Whether this is due to the faulty functioning of certain chemical substances in the body, or to some other condition, is, as yet, unknown.
One job of the American Cancer Society is to have research done on this puzzling phenomenon.

Cancer victims are to be found among young and old, men and women, married and unmarried. No age group is free from it. Babies are sometimes born with it and over two thousand people under twenty-one die of cancer every year.
Among men the danger zones for cancer are the lips, lungs, stomach, prostate gland, intestines, rectum, throat, and mouth. Among women the hazardous spots are the womb, breasts, intestines, rectum, stomach and genitourinary organs.

An unmarried woman is more likely to have cancer of the breast than a married woman who nurses her children, while cancer of the cervix occurs more often among married women who have borne children.
Cancer can be cured but only
WHAT ABOUT CANCER?
When diagnosed early and treated adequately!

There are many things you can do to guard against cancer. Many cancers can be cured if caught in time!
There are danger signals. Memorize these seven signs.

1. Any sore that does not heal, particularly about the tongue, mouth, or lips.
2. A painless lump or thickening, especially in the breast, lip, or tongue.
3. Irregular bleeding or discharge from any natural body opening. Do not wait for pain. See your doctor!
4. Progressive change in the color or size of a wart, mole, or birthmark.
5. Persistent indigestion.
6. Persistent hoarseness, unexplained cough, or difficulty in swallowing.
7. Any change in the normal bowel habits. Do not attempt to diagnose yourself. Go to the doctor!

A very good idea is to arrange for periodic health examinations for yourself and your family. Imagine the joy that knowing you are all right would bring!
A thorough examination should include:

1. Careful inspection of the entire body surface, heart, blood vessels, and a lung examination.
2. Examination by sight and touch of all body openings that can be so examined, such as the mouth, nostrils, ears, throat, sinuses, vagina, and rectum.
3. Examination of stomach and intestines by X-ray; microscopic examination of blood, urine, and any suspected tissue.
4. Examination of the eye, bladder, prostate gland in man, and special examination of breasts of women.

Education on the subject of cancer is of utmost importance, and each state has a divisional cancer society. These organizations are supported by contributions from the public and every donation made goes toward furthering the study of and eliminating this dreaded disease.
Families have been kept intact; breadwinners have been helped to stay on the job; emotional tragedy has been averted and financial suffering has been decreased.

Only you can save yourself from cancer. The cancer societies have but one mission to perform: through your contributions and the efforts of thousands of volunteers and active members, an endeavor is made to eliminate this scourge, cancer!

Public education, through the press, radio, literature, films, display, and public speakers, helps enlighten the public.
All this magnificent work is dependent upon the contributions made to the Cancer Fund.

Three paragraphs which appeared in the Montana Cancer News express completely the feeling that goes into the making of contributions:

In religion we are taught that the good deeds we do on earth store for us jewels in a heavenly crown.

But I like to think that man need not wait for heaven to receive his reward. The well-known truism "It is better to give than to receive" has often been proven by the wealth of personal and spiritual satisfaction one acquires from giving of oneself freely in unselfish service to others. There is no greater fuel to feed the flaming fire of the human spirit than unselfish service to mankind: The server serves without thought of payment, but the joy of service and the knowledge that a job which needed doing has been done, brings its own reward!

Give to the cancer society!

Sixty Years Ago
Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, May 1, and May 15, 1888

For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WomeEN oF ALL NarTIons

THE SALT LAKE SANITARIAN:
We have perused the prospectus of the Salt Lake Sanitarian, a monthly journal of medicine and surgery, about to be issued in this city. It will be devoted to the laws of life and health, diseases and their treatment. It will be edited by the Doctors Shipp, who are well known to the medical profession here, and have had quite an extensive experience in the treatment of cases in this Territory. These ladies are graduates of the Woman's Medical College in Philadelphia, and have made good use of their opportunities since they graduated, among the people here. That such a journal will be a desirable acquisition to the home literature of the Territory no one can deny. We wish these sisters every success in their new undertaking, and have no fears as to their capability to make the paper interesting and helpful to the people.

Editorial
UINTAH STAKE:
The first conference of the Relief Society held in Uintah Stake convened in the Ashley meeting house, April 1, 1888, with Sarah Pope presiding. Reports from the different branches were read. Sister A. K. Bartlett said that she felt this was a feast of rejoicing. Gave the sisters some good instructions concerning their daughters marrying; she said the daughters of Zion should go to the house of the Lord when they were married. Sister McAlling expressed her desire to do good, said she belonged to the first Relief Society that was organized in the Church. Counselor Hatch said she felt well in meeting with the sisters and gave them some good counsel. President Sarah Pope addressed the congregation on the duties of wives and mothers. She said: "It is not right to be proud and haughty, but we should be humble and prayerful and learn to govern ourselves, before we are fit to govern others."

Ada Longhurst, Secretary

THE BLUE FORGET-ME-NOT
There is a flower which oft unheeded grows,
And blooms unnoticed in some shady spot;
Modestly it hides, nor gaudy petal shows,
But whispers coyly to the breeze, "Forget me not."

The bride should wear it when she leaves her home,
The dead should have it on their coffin laid;
Our friends most prize it when afar they roam.

M. A. Greenhalgh

WHAT WE ARE CREATED FOR
Too many of our sex think it necessary to cultivate only the external part of our organizations. That is why they seem to think if they adorn themselves with all the frills and furbelows of fashion, that they are very attractive, no matter how uncouth their manners. They do this to the total neglect of the mental and physical and, I am sorry to say, sometimes the moral parts of their beings also. The body is only a casket for the spirit to dwell in; the spirit is the immortal, imperishable portion which we have inherited from our Heavenly Father. Who ever heard of a person's name being known to posterity because of the beauty of her dress? All can study fashion, but those who spend most of their time in that may perish with their clothing, and are soon forgotten. Then while we have respect enough for ourselves, our associates and our God to be neat and clean in our appearance and pleasant in our intercourse, let us not spend too much time in adorning ourselves to the neglect of cultivating our minds and manners.

HE two scholars who most influenced the high moral pattern of Chinese thought were Confucius and Mencius (around 4oo B. C.). Both were reared by widowed mothers, to whom Chinese historians give much credit for the accomplishments of their sons. Mencius' mother early noted his talent for learning and imitating. He would re-enact the solemn scenes of burial, occurring in the near-by cemetery. When she moved near a market place, he pantomimed every phase of buying and selling. Finally, she moved near a college and found that her plan worked.

KATHERINE ROMNEY STEWART (Mrs. Charles B. Stewart) aged seventy-two years, died January 19, 1948, in Los Angeles. For fifteen years she had the privilege unique among our women of practicing on the Tabernacle organ. As assistant organist to Joseph J. Daynes, she was always prepared to accompany the Tabernacle Choir. In 1903, attending the World's Fair at Chicago with the choir, she played for three days before the Women's Congress as accompanist for the vocal solos of her sister Mary (Mrs. Charles Ross), and individually as organ soloist. In Los Angeles, as branch president, then in 1923 as first stake president, she pioneered Relief Society work for twelve years. Her favorite impression of the Relief Society spirit was to gather up old folks and shutins for thoughtfully planned entertainments, or doing kind things in their homes. She was very devoted to her husband and eight children.

GAIN an American woman has won a Nobel prize. Dr. Gerti Theresa Cori shared with her husband, Dr. Ferdinand Cori, the 1947 prize for medicine. Both are faculty members at Washington University, St. Louis.

ASSOCIATED Press editors selected Princess Elizabeth as Woman of the Year; as internationally most outstanding woman in her field: beauty, Barbara Jo Walker; science, Gerti Cori; drama, June Lockhart; radio, Dorothy Shay; public service, Eleanor Roosevelt; business, Dorothy Shaver (President, Lord and Taylor department store); education, Sarah Blanding (President, Vassar College); literature, Rebecca West (British author); movies, Ingrid Bergman; sports, Babe Didrickson Zaharias.

ELDORA J. MAUGHAN, of Preston, Idaho, has been appointed to the National Congress of Parents and Teachers. One of the eight national vice-presidents, she is responsible for activities in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. She is the mother of seven active Latter-day Saints.

A Blessing for Women
As the season arrives for the discontinuance of weekly Relief Society meetings, there comes to a faithful member a feeling of release from the more arduous and exacting duties of the past eight months, and at the same time a deep sense of satisfaction for the benefit she has personally received and the good which has come to others as the result of her and her sister's work in Relief Society. It is a feeling separate and apart from the contemplation of participation in any other activity offered by women's groups.

One of the benefits to mothers which comes from Relief Society was voiced by a brother in a Relief Society meeting. He was praising the work of the society as a whole and then testified of the blessings which had come into his own home through the activity of his wife in Relief Society. He related that when their children were young it was necessary for him to be absent from the home a great deal. His wife spent so much time shut within their own walls with the responsibility of the children and the incessant caring for their needs, that finally matters came to such a crisis that their very married life was at stake. It was at this juncture that a Relief Society was formed in their vicinity and his wife became a member. Almost at once he found that her attitude had changed. Her outlook became broadened and she discovered that other women were going through the same experiences as she. As her interests increased, she found time to take thought for her own advancement and improvement. In addition to the self-development which came to her through studying the lessons, she experienced a feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment through the good she did to others as offered in Relief Society work. He ended his talk, in substance, with these words: "I have always felt that our married happiness was saved by Relief Society." This testimony of one of the worths of Relief Society to women finds echo in the hearts of thousands of members—and in the hearts of their husbands. The spirit of the gospel which permeates Relief Society meetings carries to each member, according to her desire and faithfulness—understanding, enlightenment, and a truer evaluation of her own problems with the wish to solve them in all righteousness. A woman who allows trivial pleasures or worldly interests to interfere with her attendance and participation in Relief Society is partaking of the spirit of the foolish virgins who did not keep their lamps trimmed and burning.

Relief Society was instituted by the Prophet Joseph Smith under the inspiration of the Lord. He knows the needs of his daughters and blessed them with the Relief Society. M. C. S.

NOTES TO THE FIELD

Summer Work Meetings is the desire of the General Board that a work meeting be held each month, as heretofore, during the summer period, June through September. Church Welfare sewing should take precedence over all other work activities.

Magazine Subscription Percentages for 1948 to Be Based on January Enrollment
EFFECTIVE for 1948, instead of the membership figures on which the Honor Roll percentages will be based being counted as of December 1948, they will be counted as of January 1948. This will allow the Magazine representative to obtain from the secretary, at once, the membership figures of January 1948 on which her Magazine percentage for 1948 will be figured. In this way a Magazine representative will know all through the year the number of subscriptions she must obtain in order to be on the 1948 Honor Roll. No longer will her standing be imperiled by new members being added near the close of the year.

It is hoped that this procedure will enable more Relief Societies to be on the Honor Roll.

TOO DEEP THE PEACE
Marijane Mortis

This soft spring day that lolls upon the grass,
This languid sun asleep, warm on the land,
This breeze upsetting startled leaves to pass;
Here is a peace to seek and understand.

This day the earth spreads out her color quilt,
Upon the hills, the seeded garden plot;
Along unguarded way the flowers lilt
While nature paints a quiet beauty spot.

And now I hear a sound that reaches up
Where flame-tipped blackbirds wing the topaz sky.
It does not matter that my own frail cup
Must be the symbol faith will justify.

I'll hold today as proof against the years,
And peace will be too sweet... Too deep for tears.

Planning Food Buying for Health and Economy
Bernice Stookey, Linford Iron County, Utah, Home Agent

[This article is published with the suggestion that mothers of missionaries will call it to the attention of their sons and daughters in the mission field. Ed.]

Diets first for health, and then make adjustments to meet the family income. To be thrifty and wise in selection one must first know food values, not only of fresh foods, but of commercially canned and prepared foods. Radio programs, magazines, and newspapers are saturated with attractive advertisements, some of which are fraudulent half-truths which may deceive even the most intelligent. By heeding these deceptive appeals the homemaker may not only undermine health, but may greatly increase the cost of living.

Many young mothers buy practically all fruits and vegetables already canned, especially for young children, although fresh fruits and vegetables may be wasting in their orchards and gardens, which could be cooked fresh, frozen, stored, or canned at home at a great saving. The needs and income of each particular family should determine the plan for health. The resources of a family living on a farm where fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs, poultry, and meats can be produced will cut living costs greatly. However, the extra time needed to produce and prepare home-raised food will require good planning for the work of the homemaker.

Bargain buying of food in bulk if storage space is available, buying perishable fruits and vegetables at the close of the day, or taking advantage of "specials" will also cut costs. Be cautious of specials on meats, fish, and poultry, especially ground meats. These foods deteriorate rapidly. The present high prices of these products may tempt dishonest sellers to destroy the odor of spoilage by adding harmful preservatives which also preserve the natural color. Spices and herbs, too, may be added to conceal the taste and odor of spoiled meat.

Commercially prepared foods are great time savers, and are used a great deal by most homemakers. It should be kept in mind, however, that no frozen, canned, or highly processed food is as healthful as fresh food, but the careful planner will always include enough fresh foods to keep a balanced diet.

Climate, season, geographical location, and transportation will determine the "best buys" in all foods, especially fresh foods. Homemakers will make a better selection and save time and money by planning food for several days at a time.

First check supplies on HAND, then make out a shopping list. The picture chart of the "Basic Seven" pattern for nutrition published in the April Magazine will help inexperienced cooks plan menus for health and economy.

Available supplies, Price, and necessary time for preparation will determine choice of ready prepared and fresh foods purchased. Try making 4 simplified list based on the following classification:

1. Yellow and green vegetables
2. Oranges, citrus fruits, tomatoes, taw greens
3. Potatoes, and other fruits or tables
4. Milk and cheese
5. Meat, fish or poultry, 88% beans, or dried peas
6. Bread and whole-grain cereals.
7. Fats (animal and vegetable) dried

FOLLOWING is a three-day menu and cost list for two missionaries.



The demonstration was given to a group of 274 missionaries leaving the mission home for their fields of labor in September. The menu meets all the requirements for health as advocated by the "Basic Seven." A double boiler was used in cooking since missionaries usually have access to only a hot plate or single burner, or in foreign countries, a small space on the family cook stove. To conserve time and heat, cereals were soaked overnight and cooked in top of a double boiler. To save time in preparing the evening meal, potatoes were cooked in their "jackets" in the lower part of the double boiler while the cereal was cooking. Eggs were broken in a tea cup and set down in the cereal, or cheese could be melted in a tea Cup, making a "three-story cooker." Rice pudding was cooked in the top part of cooker while vegetable soup was cooking in the lower part. The meals were planned to be quickly prepared. Canned, frozen, dried, and fresh foods were all used, and fresh, evaporated, and dried milk were used to demonstrate each type, each missionary having the equivalent of one quart of fresh milk each day. 

The actual cost of the eighteen meals for three days was $5.10, including tax.

Magazine Subscriptions for 1947
Counselor Marianne C. Sharp Hanks and gratitude are extended to the officers, Magazine representatives, and to all subscribers of The Relief Society Magazine for the excellent work which has been done throughout 1947 in obtaining a subscription of 80,978. Faithful Magazine representatives have been blessed for the long hours of work which this record has required.

Increase in Magazine Subscriptions
Particular appreciation is felt for the way in which the number of subscriptions has been maintained and even increased by 420 subscriptions over 1946, in view of the increase in subscription price to $1.50 as of July 1947. Once more Relief Society members have demonstrated their loyalty to the Society and appreciation for the Magazine.

Improvement in Content
The general board is constantly endeavoring to improve the content of the Magazine and to give to Latter-day Saint women the opportunity of improving their writing skills, and have their work preserved through the pages of the woman's magazine of the Church. It seeks to impart a message of spirituality, so much needed in the world today, to promote the work of Relief Society and publish Relief Society lessons, as well as offering reading enjoyment and articles of special interest to the homemaker.

These societies are to be congratulated on their outstanding records.
There were 24 stakes which had 100 per cent or over in subscriptions; 436 wards; 3 mission districts and 128 branches. The stakes as a whole in 1947 made an average of 78%.

New Rates for Some Foreign Missions
In order to put the Magazine on a sound financial basis, it was found necessary to increase the subscription rate to $2 for Australia, Great Britain, Europe, New Zealand, and South Africa, because of postal rates.

MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR 1947

Mission Hurstville, Australian Mission
Manavu Ward, Provo Stake (Utah) 315
350..... Geneva Dubrauski 241..... Elsie F. Parton 237... Flora Buggert 316

This has made it difficult for some foreign missions to maintain their previous high rating.
This is true of Australia which has been in the forefront for so many years.

The general board sincerely regrets the circumstances which have necessitated the increased rate of $2, and is sympathetic to the increased burden thus placed upon them.

Modernizing of Mailing
There has been a marked improvement in the last six months in the mailing of the Magazine to subscribers.
A modern system is being installed and prompt delivery from the printers has resulted in the Magazines being in the mail before the month of issue.
This has greatly decreased the amount of correspondence and resulted in improved relationships between the representatives and subscribers.

Percentages for 1948 to Be Based on January Enrollment
Effective for 1948, instead of the membership figures on which the Honor Roll percentages will be based being counted as of December 1948, they will be counted as of January 1948.
This will allow the Magazine representatives to obtain from the secretary, at once, the membership figures of January 1948 on which her Magazine percentage for 1948 will be figured.
In this way a Magazine representative will know all through the year the number of subscriptions she must obtain in order to be on the 1948 Honor Roll.

Questing Lights

CHAPTER 2

Belle Watson Anderson

Synopsis: Andrew Rumgay bids farewell to his mother, his relatives, and friends in Scotland and joins his friend Hugh Shand to emigrate to America. Andrew's fiancée, Jane Allison, is broken-hearted and fears that she will never see Andrew again.

HEN Andrew and Hugh arrived at the wharf, some of their buoyancy left them. As they carried their luggage from the dray over to the ship, they became very serious.

"Let's set our things down for a time, and rest on this bench," Hugh suggested.

England was different from Scotland. Nature seemed more controlled, subdued. The boys sat gazing at the soft, blue sky and the glorious sunset.

"More like a painted picture than the real thing," Andrew voiced his opinion. "In Scotland those white clouds would soon get to tumbling over one another and scampering hither and yon."

"Aye, but look at that harbor. Things don't happen in the Forth the way they are happening out there," Hugh volunteered.

"I was just looking at it," Andrew responded. "Ships, boats, tugs, running about, getting ready for the sea."

"They will soon be leaving for -about every port in the world." The boys watched the moving scenes, whistles blowing, men shouting orders, vessels moving from the docks, others taking their places.

A Page 340 sailboat, like a bird with raised pinions, was gracefully maneuvering about. "There's the ship Thornton," Hugh slowly reiterated. His eyes seemed fairly glued to the ship that was to take them to America.

"Well, there's the ship, and here's the ocean. It seems if we hang around for a time, we may take off for some place."

"You're right, Andrew." Some of Hugh's natural cheer returned. They arose, picked up their luggage, and began moving toward the vessel.

The ship was loaded with freight and several hundred passengers and the order of the hour was choosing permanent quarters. The bunks, upper and lower, reached all around the ship and down the center. The galley was on one side and tables were built and pegged on the stanchions, to be raised and lowered at will.

"Andrew! Hugh!" It was Bob MacKinlay coming toward them as fast as he could push through the crowd. The boys smiled when they saw him, and hurried to meet him.

"We had a mind, if we looked about we would find someone we knew," Hugh said. "Our bunk is over this way. There is an empty one next to it. Mother would like you to have it, so she can look after you. She would never be content with only one chick to scratch for. Will you come?"

QUESTING LIGHTS

"Will we come?" Hugh laughed. "Lead the way, your mother has just acquired a family."

Bob took them over to Mother MacKinlay who was happy to see them. They had often stayed at her home in Cowdenbeath when they were doing home missionary work.

HE ship was fast filling up. Soon there would be more than six hundred saints aboard. Andrew slept well that first night. He woke early, and as Hugh was still asleep, rose and went on deck. It was a beautiful morning. The ship was rising and falling with the waves.

The elder's heart felt like that  rising because he was on his way to Zion falling when he thought of home and loved ones. Once again he wondered if he was doing the right thing. It would not be long until the ship would be sailing, then he could not turn back if he wanted to. He meditated for a few minutes, then went almost running to the bunk.

Hugh was making the bed. "How long have you been up, Andrew?" His friend did not answer. Hugh looked up. "Come sit by me on the bunk. You are taking this trip too seriously."

"Andrew covered his face with his hands, trying for self-control. "Let's have prayers, Hugh, before the saints begin moving about. You pray. I just can't this morning."

The boys knelt and during prayer peace filled their hearts. Andrew found his anchor.

The boys were hungry. The fresh, salt air was doing things to their appetites. 341

Hugh returned from the galley, half laughing. He handed Andrew his breakfast. "Strange work for a Scotchman. I never served a meal in my life."

"Nor I," Andrew responded. "That's what mothers are for. I guess we've taken our mothers too much for granted."

"By the way, Rumgay, how are your mother's scones this morning?" "Fine," answered his friend, "and your mother's griddle cakes?"

"The best ever!" Hugh answered as he half-choked on his porridge, "a special treat from our mothers this morning." Andrew washed the dishes and put the table in place. He opened his kist and took out his Book of Mormon and his father's hymn book, which his mother had given him as a keepsake. He opened the hymn book and for a time read hymns. He began humming some of the tunes. He had always wanted to sing the gospel.

He turned to his mother's favorite, "Lead Kindly Light." He used to sing it with her. He began to sing, smoothly for a time, but when he got to the middle of the verse, he was at the end of the tune; when he got to the end of the verse he was in the middle of the tune. He tried again, with the same results.

Hugh came up unnoticed. Andrew determined not to give up and kept on singing. Shand, holding his sides with laughter, fell: on the bunk. He laughed until Rumgay began to see the funny side, too, and joined him in the fun.

342

THE British mission president attended the priesthood meeting. Brother Byron Wood was chosen president of the company. Andrew Rumgay was made first counselor, and Erick Nelson, the second. William Walker was sustained as clerk. The president explained that the organization represented the conference in the mission field or the stake in Zion. Later, wards would be organized and fully officered.

He asked the people to take care of their health by cleanliness, right health habits, and by keeping the Word of Wisdom. After the meeting Andrew was greeted by the officers and his friends and acquaintances who promised him their help and support. He could not believe that it was true.

Hugh was delighted, for, as he told Andrew, the best way to forget one's own troubles is to help others solve theirs.

The shades of evening were falling fast on the harbor and on the city of Liverpool, on the towers of its churches, and on the joys and cares of its people. A tugboat was puffing and spouting, its lines fast to the Thornton.

"All ashore that's going ashore!" Andrew's heart stood still. Could it be possible? Yes, the ship was moving. He went on deck. A fair wind was blowing down the river. The sails were being loosed to the breeze. Andrew watched the ship move forward first on the power of the tugs, then on its own power.

He stood in meditation and in prayer.

This life was like the ocean, every wave a second on the sea of time, and each persistently passing; the INLAND WAVE SOCIETY MAGAZINE MAY 1948 inland waves were moving towards home and security; the outgoing waves were strangely adrift. The responsibility of over six hundred people was divided. The officers followed the mission president's recommendation and divided the stake into wards and chose officers for each group. In this way the president could know the condition of every saint aboard. The Scotch Ward was asked for entertainment for one Friday afternoon and Brother Coleman, the choir leader, prepared the program. He chose talented members of the group to take part. These included Hugh who sang tenor and had thrilled so many Latter-day Saint gatherings in Scotland, Brother Coleman's daughter Kathleen, who had studied music in Edinburgh, and Fannie and Agnes Ramsay as highland fling dancers. The choir held several rehearsals and, after one of them, Hugh came back dancing and singing. "Today I met the real Scotch heather. What a girl! Have you met Brother Coleman's daughter?" Andrew looked up with a questioning smile. "Don't tell me you've fallen again, Shand? I was thinking you were cured. You haven't been in love since we came aboard." "Miss Coleman is different." "That much I can say for them all," Andrew responded. "Imagine meeting her right here on the Thornton," Hugh continued. "Ladies travel the seven seas, too. There's no law against that," Andrew answered. Next morning Hugh was busy shaving, brushing his clothes, and getting ready to meet Kathleen Coleman. Andrew wasn't worried. 

QUESTING LIGHTS

This had happened many times before, and it would probably happen many times again. The saints had a good time at the party and after the program they danced until late. Andrew danced several sets, then went on deck. Hugh was having the time of his life dancing with all the girls, Scotch or not, and Kathleen Coleman certainly wasn't being neglected. Andrew watched them for awhile, then turned his attention to the ocean. The moon and stars were very bright. Andrew felt near to his loved ones. The skies tonight belonged to him and to Jane. The Scotch melodies from the organ, violin, and accordion rising from the steerage, mingled with the rhythm of the water, set his emotions in time and tune with his longing for his sweetheart.

"Elder Rumgay, we've been looking for you." It was Hugh, Kathleen Coleman, and her friend Margaret Purvis. "Don't tell us you left the party to come up here to be alone. It doesn't say very much for our company, now does it?" Kathleen Coleman asked. "Does he love Andrew?" Hugh was teasing. He knew how to get quick response from his friend. "He spends half his time on deck all alone." "I love the ocean more, if you can believe that, after listening to Brother Shand." "Now we want to capture you, Brother Rumgay," Margaret Purvis was speaking. "We can howl like the ocean, dance like the waves, and sing like the wind. Doesn't that sound inviting?" Andrew was very much amused. 343 He was sure he liked Margaret Purvis.

"But," the young lady continued, "wouldn't you just know that anything we could offer wouldn't compare with Miss Allison's charms?" "I wonder what the young lady expects, when she turns her man over to the wiles of scheming women?" Kathleen asked laughingly. "She's optimistic," Hugh added. "I'm sorry to be so disappointing. I'll try and improve my ways," Andrew assured his friends.

SATURDAY was a dark and cloudy day. The ship had just been cleaned from bow to stern and was as neat and shining as Mother Mac's proverbial new pin when they heard the winds blowing and the patter of rain on deck. Portholes were closed and hatches were bolted down. The air, not too good in the steerage when they had some ventilation, became stale and offensive when fresh air was shut out. The constant rocking of the boat, the confinement in the small quarters, the changed diet, were beginning to be evident in the health of the people who had been accustomed to outdoor life. They were used to getting up early and out to their work, in many cases the women going with their husbands to the fields, to the factory, and to the pits. Sunday was fast day and the time was given over to the saints for testimony bearing. If stormy days were taking a toll of their strength, their faith was just as strong and evident, perhaps even more so, than on fairer days.

Several of the congregation led in hymns, some in prayer. One sister read, a poem:

I am Zionward bound
To the saints' peaceful rest
To the valleys of Ephraim,
Their home in the West.
Far remote from sin,
Oh, may God give me strength
All things to overcome.

Andrew Rumgay spoke for a few minutes. "As a child looks to its parents for support and comfort, so our Father in heaven expects us to look to him, casting all our cares upon the Lord, for he in very truth loves us. He bids us ask and we shall receive, to prove him and see if he will not open the windows of heaven to his children. He declares where there are two or three gathered together, they shall ask and his spirit shall be with them."

The storm continued. Monday morning found a large number of the emigrants ill, many of them seriously. The well volunteered to take care of the sick. Every ward tried to take care of its own. Andrew assisted every place possible. Night and day, he was at someone's bedside, following out the orders of the ship doctor.

One afternoon Andrew, tired out, went to the bunk to rest. Hugh wasn't up, and yet he wasn't sleeping. He was reluctant to answer the most casual question, saying he was just too tired. Andrew sat down on a box near the bunk. He felt Hugh's head. It was hot. "How long has this been going on, young man?" Andrew questioned. Hugh did not answer.

Andrew thought, why don't the winds and rain stop? We haven't a chance in this gloom and darkness. He arose and walked over to INLAND WAVE SOCIETY MAGAZINE MAY 1948 Mother MacKinlay's. She had just come back from nursing the sick. "It's the last straw, Mother," he said.

"What is it, Andrew?" Mother MacKinlay asked. "Are you ill?"

"No, but Hugh is. His life is more precious to me than my own. He's mother, sister, brother, sweetheart, wrapped up in one. What are we going to do, Mother?"

"Well, you are going to stop your worrying, this very minute, and bring the elders. We will begin right now to take care of him. You remember, Andrew, when two or three shall ask, it shall be given."

"Sometimes, Mother, it's so very hard to have faith." The elders, Brother Wood and Brother Nelson, came and administered to Hugh. The doctor came as soon as he found time. Brother Nelson volunteered to stay with Hugh all night as Andrew had to have some rest.

Mother MacKinlay would not leave the sick boy and she assisted Brother Nelson. The winds went down and the skies cleared, yet Hugh remained a very sick man. Mother Mac could see that the doctor was very worried, and she was worried, too. Finally, through prayer and fasting, a great change came over Hugh. His face became natural, his temperature began going down, and the hearts of the watchers were filled with joy and thanksgiving. ANOTHER week, and Hugh was out of danger. Kathleen still watched at his bedside. Every afternoon she would read several chapters out of Andrew's books to him. The sun was radiant in the skies; HEALTH AND THANKSGIVING were in the hearts of the people. Day after day the reading continued. Andrew was beginning to wonder if his friend would ever get well, but in time he got about again, and became strong and well. One afternoon Hugh asked, "Have you ever been best man at a wedding, Andrew?" "Indeed, I have not, and probably never will, until I'm best man at my own," Andrew answered. "That's where you ate wrong, sir, for I'm asking you to be best man at mine." "Hoot mon," Andrew returned, "what is this that the lad is saying? Hardly has his voice changed, and he jokes about marriage." "This is no joke. Kathleen and I are going to be married Wednesday afternoon. We talked it over with Brother Coleman tonight. He thinks it's fine." Andrew sat on the bunk, almost stunned for a moment, then he arose and went on deck. The low song of the swells was soothing. The moon was at its zenith; the water white-black, as it played with the moonbeams. A ship was a dreaming thing; it brought fairy folk over the crest. Then carried them away, as far as King's Kettle. Now in the moonlight he saw Jane coming towards him. She seemed so close to him that he could reach out and take her in his arms, then she was far away in the dimness of the night. He was alone. Everyone was sleeping, but the watch at the wheel, the waves, and himself. The night seemed long, quiet, and lonely. His friend was to be married. 345 It was different to plan a wedding. The saints had been living 'the dark side, the serious side, now they switched to romance and happiness. Captain Collins invited Kathleen and Hugh to be married on deck because they were the handsomest couple ever to be married on the Thornton. The Scotch people decided to make it a grand affair. The women began putting their heads together. One came with a beautiful wedding dress. It had to be altered, but soon it was made to fit perfectly. Another brought treasured flowers, a third a pair of slippers. It was a beautiful wedding party that stood at the improvised altar. President Wood was waiting. "And for Bonnie Annie Laurie I would lay me down and die!" were the strains of music sacredly played, as Kathleen and Hugh happily answered, "I do." The Captain ordered the American colors hoisted. A program of music, songs, and Scotch solo dances followed, and then refreshments. Andrew's contribution was Jane's fruit cake and shortbread. Andrew had intended to return to his bunk after the ceremony, but after the program he danced with Kathleen, and, as he couldn't be rude, he then danced with Margaret, and so the dancing went merrily on. Everything was forgotten but the rhythm and harmony of the dance. Andrew sat one out and Margaret joined him. "Oh, I think everything is so wonderful tonight. Kathleen and Hugh are so happy. They are so suited to one another, a perfect couple, I would call them." 346 "They are fortunate in finding each other." "You are wonderful, too," Margaret modestly addressed the young elder. "You were so helpful during that terrible siege of sickness. Not many saints aboard the Thornton will ever forget you." Andrew was surprised and confused. "You're very kind, Sister Purvis. You know the Scotchman's weakness it's hard for him to be useful around women folk. The lassies spoil their men." "Well, they seem to have missed you," she responded. "But we are letting the music go to waste, Sister Purvis will you dance?" "I'd love to, Brother Rumgay." "If a body meet a body Comin' through the rye, If a body kiss a body, Need a body cry." The party began breaking up. "Happy sailing, Hugh and Kathleen," everyone was shouting. "Happy sailing!" Margaret and Andrew echoed as he left Margaret at her ship home. "Happy sailing," Andrew prayed aloud, as he folded his Sunday clothes and put them back into the kist. His friend and companion was married. Ew OK HE day after the wedding, work was the order of business for everyone strong enough to help RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MAY 1948 with the making of tents, and tops for their handcarts. The patterns had been made and cut, now the material had to be measured, cut and sewed. The steerage hummed with busy people. It was wonderful just to have something to do. The work was hard. It made sore hands, and aching backs. Days ran into weeks. They were nearing the other side. One morning Margaret went almost running past Andrew's bunk. He had been reading. "What's your hurry, Margaret? No use running on shipboard. Time is the one thing we have in quantity." "Not any more, Elder Rumgay. The captain was just saying if it wasn't for the fog on the harbor, we could see the lights." "Oh, that is good news!" "Margaret, it hasn't been such a bad trip, yet I'm longing to set foot on the sacred soil of America." "Oh, if it's just land, Brother Rumgay, any old land. Many nights I have thought the ship was sinking." Margaret went running with the news to Mother Mac and Kathleen. Soon the ship was moving slowly into the harbor. Once again came the pilot and the tugs. "That's the way I have been guided all of my life by my Pilot and Tugs to the shores of Zion." Andrew gratefully thanked the Lord. (To be continued) FOR THE BEREFT Christie Lund Coles These words are for those who have lost their love, Who must walk bereft the whole world wide With only their courage for sustenance And their pride.

Planning Food Buying for Health and Economy (Continued from page 312)

LUNCH: Beef and vegetable soup (soup bone, 6 carrots, 2 onions, 3 potatoes, outer leaves of cabbage)  
Sliced tomatoes Bread Butter Rice pudding with raisins Milk

SUPPER: Soup left from lunch Bread Butter Rice pudding left from lunch Milk

Sunday: BREAKFAST Cantaloupe Cooked cereal Soft-cooked eggs Bread: Butter Milk

LUNCH: Creamed peas (frozen or canned) Tuna, and potatoes Sliced cucumber Bread Butter Milk Grapes

SUPPER: Creamed peas, tuna, and potatoes left from dinner Bread Butter Sliced peaches and evaporated milk Milk Cup cakes

Note: Two tablespoons of dried milk were added each day to the cereal after it was cooked; % cup was used in the rice pudding; and % cup in the creamed peas, and tuna, used on Sunday.

Compare this well-balanced, carefully selected diet with this poor example of food buying for families with low incomes. Actual cost, September 1947:  
1 pound shelled pecans $2.50  
2-8 oz. Cans lobster at 1.05 2.10  
1-4 OZ. Can mushrooms 42 5-02 tax +10 Total $5.12

Families with sufficient incomes could afford "luxury" foods as shelled pecans, lobster, and mushrooms, but there would be no more food value in the pecans than in a pound of peanut butter, no more value in the lobster than in tuna. Missionaries who wished to spend more for food might add more meat, liver, butter, cream, prepared desserts, etc., but this three-day diet as planned meets health requirements.

FOOD LIST WITH COSTS FOR THE THREE-DAY MENU FOR TWO MISSIONARIES  
Cereal oatmeal or cracked wheat $.06  
Bread 3 loaves +39  
Butter 1/4 pound 44  
Peanut butter 1/4 pound 12

Cup cakes 2 packages  

Cantaloupe 1 large 12 $5.02 Tax 10 Total Cost $5.12

The cost list was checked in October, November, and December. There was little change except seasonal changes to be expected in fruits and vegetables. In October, due to surpluses on the market, lettuce was special at 3c a pound; cauliflower, 6c a pound, tomatoes and cucumbers had passed the peak and were raised to 23c a pound; head lettuce was used in place of tomatoes and cucumbers, cauliflower in place of cabbage; fresh peaches were so high, canned fruit was substituted; squash was the cheapest yellow vegetable in November, celery the cheapest green leafy vegetable. Pears and grapes remained the same price during October and November but were higher in December. Oranges and apples were the best buys in raw fruit in December. Cabbage, potatoes, and tomato juice the best in their respective groups.

Regardless of location, the "Basic Seven" given by the United States Department of Agriculture is our best food pattern. It may be altered to meet family needs and incomes, but is fundamental as a guide in planning food for health.

LEGACY  
Gene Romolo A legacy of love cannot be lost As other legacies may disappear, For they who build it never count the cost Of their heroic efforts year by year. The memories my mother left to me Are like bright tapers burning through the night Before a shrine within a sacristy They fill my life with such a lovely light! I think of mother banishing her tears With voice of song, and answering demands Of life with patient faith in the lean years That stamped work's dignity upon her hands. These memories, with others left to me, Are my imperishable legacy.

FREEDOM'S LOAVES

May W. Andrus, President, North Idaho Falls Stake Relief Society, reports that this unique flower show provided unusual interest and entertainment.

"Two hundred and fifty women assembled at the flower show and social. The floral theme was brought out in songs by the Singing Mothers and the children (pictured above) in song and dance. The stake tabernacle was fragrant with a multitude of colorful varieties of flowers which graced the stage and covered pedestals, terraces, tables, and steps at various angles, revealing the best in floral glory.

This entertainment climaxed the Centennial beautification program, the theme of which was Let the people plant every tree, shrub, and flower that will flourish in this climate, to make our mountain home a paradise and our hearts wells of gratitude to the God of Joseph."

NORTH WEBER STAKE (UTAH), WILSON WARD THREE GENERATIONS OF RELIEF SOCIETY WORKERS ASSEMBLED IN REUNION AT THE CLOSE OF UTAH'S CENTENNIAL YEAR
In the front row are nine of the thirteen women who have acted as ward presidents since the society was organized as a "Female Charitable Organization of the Wilson Precinct of West Weber Ward, July 10, 1878."
Left to right: Carol C. Nash, present president; Elizabeth H. Wilson, whose parents were early settlers of West Weber. The Wilson Ward was named for her husband's people; Laura C. Platt, granddaughter of one of the founders of Nauvoo, Illinois; Lillian B. Belnap, whose grandmother, Genet Bingham, was the first president of the Wilson Ward Relief Society; Drucilla H. MeFarland, whose grandmother, Sarah Ann Martin, was second president of the organization and counselor to the first president; Melva O. Stratford, present president, of North Weber Stake Relief Society; Gladys H. Sorenson, granddaughter of West Weber pioneers; Esther E. Bingham, granddaughter-in-law of Amanda Bingham, first secretary of the society; Rosalia B. Strickler, whose parents were converts from Switzerland.

Representative of the group in general is Idella M. Johnson, seventh from the left in the next to the top row. She attended the first meetings of the society as infant daughter of Sarah Ann Martin, young pioneer wife who came to the "West-of-Weber" country when it was still inhabited by Indians (1856). Sister Martin was president for twenty-eight years. Sister Johnson has served as treasurer and as a visiting teacher.

The minutes of this society, through the years, show many interesting accomplishments, such as the gradual development of the welfare plan from the time the women went visiting with a baby on one arm and a basket for gathering contributions on the other arm. Carpet rags, homemade soap, wheat, flour, thread, and other items were contributed.

Now, many of these faithful sisters, descendants of the pioneers, are working efficiently in canneries and sewing centers where shiploads of provisions are prepared to aid the people in lands far distant from the home valley.

FRIEND Grace B. Davis For all the beauty of this lovely tree,
For stately grace and verdant mystery
Of restless leaves whose movements lightly trace
Their graceful patterns as they interlace
In shadowed arabesques upon the velvet sod, My heart sends up its grateful thanks to God.
Her brooding branches gently sway and bend
To moods of wandering winds that lightly tend
The tiny nestlings as their cradles high
Swing gently to a twilight lullaby.
For shadowed coolness, strength, and majesty,
My heart rejoices in this friendly tree. - Mother's Scrapbook Ida R. Allredge

I was too busy and too carefree then,
And she, too patient far to reprimand.
In comradery, she sought to understand;
The years slipped by and she was laid to rest.
Oh, how I longed to counsel with her then,
Her arms around, my head upon her breast,
To feel her calm assurance once again.
One day I found her scrapbook, worn with age,
And hungrily I scanned each fingered page
My baby face, a lock of golden hair,
Choice sayings and a simple little prayer;
I shed my worries like an old, worn cloak,
For from these yellowed pages, mother spoke.

Made Gold edges, SECRETS

Ella J. Coulam

I told my deepest secret
To a little humming bird.
She vowed that she would keep it
And never tell a word.
Today, I saw her whispering
To each flower in the sun
I know she's told my secret
To every listening one.

When next I have a message
Of love and kindly word
I'll pretend that it's a secret
And tell a humming bird.

> SUMMONS

Marion Garibaldi

Twig-colored bird,
Stir the gray bough!
Infinite purpose
Everywhere, now!

Rainbows and flowers
Out of the murk.
Mystery, power,
In springtime lurk.

Lily and weed
Their work must do;
Courage, comrade,
Joy summons you!

Ie

Father in Heaven, I Thank Thee Arabella Hoke

Father in heaven, I thank thee tonight
For sleep and for rest
And for the stars so bright;
For angels to protect me
Till morning light.
Father in heaven, I thank thee.
Father in heaven, I thank thee today
For health and for strength
To go on my way;
For food and for raiment
And the wind that blows free,
Father in heaven, I thank thee.

From Near and Sar Camilla Eyring Kimball, author of our feature "Let Every Day Be Mother's Day," was born in Colonia Juarez, Mexico. She attended B.Y.U. And U.S.A.C., and taught home economics at Millard Academy and Gila Academy. She is the wife of Elder Spencer W.

Kimball of the Quorum of the Twelve, and they have three sons and one daughter; the eldest son, with his wife and three little daughters, is studying at Oxford University in England; the daughter, with her husband and baby girl, lives in Salt Lake City; the second son is a missionary in New England; the youngest son is a student at the University of Utah. It might interest you to know that your beautiful temple in Hawaii is shown many times on our projection screen from color photographs, which my husband took there on his way home from the islands of the Pacific. Our friends always gasp with delight at one taken of the grounds, a blue pool surrounded by trees. Although my work is unknown to you, your work is quite familiar to me because of those pictures.

I should like to thank you for the very fine things you are giving us in the Magazine. Recently my little daughter tore her plastic covered umbrella beyond repair. We read and followed the article by Mrs. Perschon (January 1948) on how to cover an old umbrella frame to our mutual benefit. Now she has a new umbrella; I have a new experience and knowledge. Happy and proud to be a contributor to such a magazine as our Relief Society Magazine. May you find great joy in your work and inspired help for every problem.

Our dear author, what a delightful story "Pankapaw," by Deone Sutherland (March 1948). Surely you make the Page 360 commonplace sublime. I think of Bret Hart making "'Miggles" a soulful story through his love for the plain and unnoticed, Write some more, please.

Cloe B. Rogers, Ogden, Utah.
Incidentally, I surely enjoy The Relief Society Magazine. I read it and pass it on.

Karl Spafford, New England Mission.
Your very fine magazine has an important place in our home. I find my mother and my daughter enjoy it as I do. Success to you in your work is the wish of all Relief Society members everywhere.
