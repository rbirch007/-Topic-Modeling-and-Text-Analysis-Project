Doctrinal Exposition of the Doctrine and Covenants

For Tuesday, April 20, 1948
Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the wisdom contained in modern scripture.

The most frequent type of writing found in the Doctrine and Covenants is that of doctrinal exposition and instruction. This is not strange, either, when one considers the state of affairs the world was in at the time of Joseph Smith's first vision. So snarled were the concepts of men regarding the way of life that churches had sprung up on the slightest pretext of doctrine. To a youth of questioning mind, such as Joseph, there could be no satisfaction in the evasive turns of reason propounded by the ministers of his day. Small wonder, then, that there was much need for inspired instruction through a latter-day prophet, if the simple truths of the gospel were again to be understood.

As suggested in the title of this modern scripture, the Lord's doctrines and covenants have come to earth again in renewed ways. These throw additional light upon the Priesthood, the Organization, the ordinances and commandments of his Church, and point the way his saints must go to find salvation. The Lord has spoken to us in this day in the language which we can understand.

Note the following passages:
Treasure up in your minds continually the words of life (84:85).
For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads (25:12).

Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; for the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in no wise lose their reward (58:27-28). For this is a day of warning, and not a day of many words. For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in the last days (63:58). Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming (64:23). I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise (82:10). Yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith (88:118). Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated (88:124). And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen (89:18-21). For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; and when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple. The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth (93:33-36). Verily, verily, I say unto you, that when I give a commandment to any of the sons of men to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them and hinder them from performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to accept of their offerings. And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and commandments I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord God (124:49, 50). It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance (131:6). Here is writing with the inspiration of divinity. Activities and Readings for Appreciation The discussion for this class period may well be spent in reading a number of sections of the Doctrine and Covenants which bring added light to the gospel. For example, in the 93 section, the Lord defines the relationship between himself and the Father, in the following verses 1-5: Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am; and that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and are one—the Father because he gave me of his fulness, and the Son because I was in the world and made flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men. I was in the world, and received of my Father, and the works of him were plainly manifest. This section 93 also deals with the record of John, the apostle and revelator, Jesus Christ, the Firstborn, the place of man in the beginning with God, the eternal nature of the elements, and the glory of God. It is the direct and forceful manner of this inspired scripture that appeals. Call upon the class to read carefully each part of this section outlining the above doctrines and note for discussion the clarity of language and style of expression. Single out those passages which are best remembered. Additional sections for similar discussions may be found under the numbers 27, 29, 84, 88, 107. There are others which may be suggested by the class. Be ready to read and discuss a favorite passage of instruction you have loved from the Doctrine and Covenants.

Social Science-Essentials in Home Training Lesson 6- Tolerance Elder Joseph Jacobs
For Tuesday, April 27, 1948
Objective: To show that the teachings of the Lord breathe the spirit of tolerance, and that tolerance is not acceptance.
What Is Tolerance?
It was Voltaire who said, "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." Such is the spirit of tolerance. Tolerance is a calm, generous respect for the opinions of others, even of one's enemies. It recognizes the right of every man to think his own thoughts, to live his own life, to be himself in all things, so long as he does not run counter to the rights of others. It means giving to others the same freedom that we ourselves crave (William George Jordan: The Power of Truth, page 97).

Wherein Do We See the Tolerance of Christ Manifest?
Christ's teachings exemplified tolerance. During his ministry, the Savior was accused of consorting with the sinners and publicans and with many people whom the accusers thought beneath his station. Jesus' reply to this accusation was: They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick ... for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance (Matt 9:12, 13). Tolerance makes a distinction between the sin and the sinner. The Lord himself said: For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance; nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven (D&C 1:31-32). We are not to condone sin nor partake of it in any form, but neither should we judge the sinner: "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men" (D&C 64:10). When the woman taken in adultery was brought before Christ, the scribes and Pharisees sought to trap Jesus because the law of Moses decreed that such should be stoned: "But what sayest thou?" they demanded. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.

So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more (John 8:6-11). His admonition, "go and sin no more," gave her new hope for the future. Only God can see the strivings, the desires, the real intent of a person's heart. We see only the outward manifestations, and so we are not qualified to judge. When we sit in solemn judgment of the acts and characters of those around us and condemn them with the easy nonchalance of our ignorance,... We reveal our intolerance (William George Jordan: The Power of Truth, page 105).

What Is the Latter-day Saint Viewpoint Regarding Religious Tolerance? As Latter-day Saints, in reviewing the past history of our Church, we know the venom of religious intolerance. It seems incredible that men could heap such vicious hatred upon any people because of their religious views, however, the pages of history are filled with accounts of the awful persecution of the innocent because of religion. Tolerance for the religious beliefs of others is part of the Latter-day Saint doctrine. Our 11th Article of Faith says: We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may. Free agency is an eternal principle by means of which God permits us to work out our own destiny. The right of every man to live as he sees fit is a sacred privilege. At one time the Prophet Joseph Smith was asked how he governed so many people harmoniously in one faith. His reply was simple but full of wisdom: "I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves." The incident is related that when the members of the Catholic church first began to hold meetings in Salt Lake City they had no place in which to meet and the use of the old Tabernacle was offered to them. And so they made use of this building for their services. President Brigham Young was also instrumental in getting the title cleared when they purchased their first property here. This was an example of true religious tolerance.

When we desire to show others the truths we have in our gospel, we should seek to do it in a spirit of love and gentleness, kindness and humility. Never does tolerance use the sting of sarcasm or the taunt of ridicule. In a recent lecture given before a group of missionaries soon to go into the mission field, this statement was made: "Vanity is the one thing that may make a missionary fail. Humility is essential." We have no right to be smug or overbearing about our religion. Ours should be a spirit of humble gratitude that we have been privileged to partake of the gospel. Only by our good works, our kindness, and patience may we influence others to see the worth of gospel principles.

Speaking of the power of the Priesthood, we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, 121:41, 42: No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.

How Has Tolerance Played Its Part in Making America Great? The greatness of the American nation is very largely due to the tolerance of its people for the different groups included within its boundaries. Through the contributions of each group, progress and advancement have been made possible to a degree undreamed of in any other nation. Its broad privileges and opportunities reach out and encompass all nationalities and creeds.

The present troubles in Palestine, India, and China are directly traceable to the intolerance of one group for another.

We need tolerance toward other races and nations. Human emotions are the same in all parts of the world, and until there can be friendship and consideration for each other and each other's problems, strife will exist.

To learn to get on with people, to learn to win them to willing co-operation, to mutual understanding, to mutual respect, is one of the most valuable things we can do in life. You can only do it first by cultivating the habit of looking for good in other people, not their faults. One small thing is worth noticing.

Albert Victor BariLuiE, the Dean of Windsor: The Making of a Man, page 118

Intolerance believes it is born with the peculiar talent for managing the affairs of others, without any knowledge of the details, better than the men themselves, who are giving their life's thought to the vital questions.... Let us not seek to fit the whole world with shoes from our individual last (William George Jordan: The Power of Truth, page 104).

Because I enjoy a certain type of music or a certain kind of book is no reason you should appreciate the same. Because I choose one profession is no reason yours is not equally important and beneficial to mankind. Because I do my work in a certain manner is no reason I should disdain your way.

Tolerance helps us to recognize and respect the differences in others and to make allowance for those differences. It enables us to respect differences in opinion, in disposition, in training, in environment, in education, in ability and opportunity. Intolerance seeks to live other people's lives for them; sympathy helps us to live their lives with them.... No one of us is infallible... Let us accept the little failings of those around us as we accept facts in nature, and make the best of them, as we accept the hard shells of nuts, the skin of fruits, the shadow that always accompanies light....

Intolerance sees the mote in its neighbor's eye as larger than the beam in its own.

Instead of concentrating our thought on the one weak spot in a character, let us seek to find some good quality that offsets it, just as a credit may more than cancel a debt on a ledger account.... Let us not constantly speak of roses having thorns, let us be thankful that the thorns have roses.... Measuring a man by his weakness alone is unjust. This little frailty may be but a small mortgage on a large estate.... (WILLIAM GEORGE Jordan: The Power of Truth, pp. 106, 107, 108).

There is a grave danger, of course, lest we admire tolerance merely in the abstract. We may see that it is needed in government, international affairs, and in business, and overlook the fact that it is needed equally in our own home. It is not enough that we be theoretically tolerant toward another nation if we are narrow toward the man in the next office.... Of all the commandments, "Love thy neighbor" is the least enforceable, the most voluntary (The Reader's Digest, February 1946, page 15).

How May Tolerance Be Fostered in the Home?

Tolerance in the home is vital to harmony and to happy, normal development. Parents must learn early that no two of their children are alike, nor can they be treated the same. One may exhibit a tendency which may never make its appearance in the disposition of another. One may be shy and reserved and may need more praise, kindness, and stimulation to develop his character, while another may try to dominate and show off, or there may be many variations between these two extremes.

One child may have a distinct talent for music while another may never be able to carry a tune, but may show outstanding mechanical ability. One mother said that in disciplining her two boys, the same treatment would never apply to both. If the elder son noticed she had been crying over something he had done, he was immediately contrite and anxious to make amends; but if she ever shed tears over the younger one, he became disgusted and angry.

Intolerance manifests itself in suppression of individuality, in stern prohibitions and penalties. An intolerant parent may endeavor to break the will of a child instead of directing it in channels suited to its disposition. Confidence, sympathy, and love are the attributes which work wonders with children. President George Albert Smith has said, "If you can't get a person to do what you wish through love, there is no other way." Leading is much more successful than driving.

Parents should not set themselves up as dictators to rule the every thought and word of a child. A few basic rules should be set up and then the individuality of each member of the family should be allowed to express itself. Sometimes parents are slow to realize that their children have grown up and can think for themselves. There comes a day when they are adults and desire to solve their own problems. Love and kindly advice, however, will always be valued, if the proper relationship has been built up during the early years.

Let us be tolerant of the weakness of others, sternly intolerant of our own. Let
