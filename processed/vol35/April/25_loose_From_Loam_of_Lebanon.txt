Sown with the kernel of his word, suspended, still,
Waiting the promise of an Easter sun,
The shadow of the cross fell dark upon the hill,
Winter-dark, as loam of Lebanon.

After the sorrow and the waning light,
Its full-blow flower of fertility
Burst into a bloom so vast and bright
It gilded the riffled blue of Galilee.

Now every sea, the Easter time returning,
Repeats upon its breast the ancient gold
And every Easter Sabbath, children, learning,
Mark the lily, from a tomb, unfold.

And Bethany, Capernaum, Judea, The loved geography disciples know, The sepulcher of him from Arimathaea, Gleam eternal in the lasting afterglow.

Chapter 3 (Conclusion)

JOE opened his eyes and stared unbelievably at Anne, standing near his bed. "How—when—did you come?" he gasped.

Anne bent over and kissed him. "Never mind, dear. I've come; that's all that matters."

"I'm so sorry," he said weakly, "I didn't get you away from there before this happened. It must be terrible for you out there alone with the kiddies. Delia was right. I should never have taken you away from town in the beginning. I'm glad you came. I want you to get Hadfield to take over. He can have the crop for anything he wants to give. You bring the children and come back to your mother's at once. I'll be out again in a couple of months—I hope."

"Joe, will you please stop talking," cried Anne, drawing a chair close to his bed in the little white hospital room. "Why, you're feverish."

"I'm the farmer now, dear, and I'm turning nothing over to Hadfield. What I'm anxious about is what have you turned over to him?"

Joe looked confused. "Well, honey, agreed to take what he offered. I could see I had to let the place go, and he was the only one who would give me anything."

Joe's face clouded, and he struggled to lift his head.

"Say, has he been bothering you?" Anne smiled.

"Not exactly, but he's going to. He says he gave you a down payment, and now he wants me to leave everything."

"Oh, yes, the check. I've never cashed it."

"Can we manage to get along without it?"

"You know better than I do, dear."

"Well, we can!" Anne made up her mind instantly, and felt new strength.

"Forgive me, dear, for being so impatient. I know now that I don't want to sell the homestead. I've learned to love it."

Tears and smiles lighted Anne's sensitive face at the same moment, and she struggled under a great emotion.

"Darling!" exclaimed Joe, "do you really mean it?"

He tried again to raise himself so that he could look squarely into her sparkling eyes to make sure he had not heard wrong.

"I know I can make it worth while—if you'll stay a little longer."

Suddenly, he fell back on his pillow weakly. "But Hadfield'll never let it go," he murmured in a tone of stark disillusionment.

Anne threw herself down by him and broke into sobs.

"I'm sorry, so sorry, dear. It's my fault."

Back on the homestead in a few days she took up her task again. The heat and drought of the late summer were forcing the wheat toward maturity, yet at the same time driving the ravenous squirrels down from the hills and the fly-pestered cattle along the sagging fences.

Fighting the squirrels and keeping back the cattle were like fighting a war. Anne tried to carry out the analogy in her own mind. For the life of her she had never been able to picture the tremendous clashes of two opposing armies. But she did understand, now, the meaning of struggle against elemental forces in nature, and she was learning the strategy of combat.

She could leave Dick and Betsy playing in the dry creek bed while she lugged a heavy bucket of poisoned oats around the wheat field, criss-crossing through it a half dozen times until her body was wet with perspiration, and her mouth was as dry as cotton. She could also set a broken fence post, tie and tighten a broken strand of barbed wire, even drive the cattle back over the ridge, yelling at them until she was hoarse.

She could do all this, and more, at the same time worrying lest a snake or a porcupine molest her chickens or her children. Then there was Joe lying in the hospital. The latest reports indicated he might have to have another operation on one of his legs. She often found relief in tears, but she also smiled bravely, and inwardly rejoiced over the discovery of hidden strength in her own nature.

She laughed and joked with Dickie and Betsy, and made up whimsical little games by which she turned their daily duties into play. She even laughed at her hard, blistered hands and brown face.

"What would Della say now," she wondered.

Suddenly Joe started to write regularly. He had his arm and one of his legs out of the cast, and RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948 what was even more wonderful, the threatened second operation was not going to be necessary.

"Just a little longer," he declared, "and I'll be out. Then you're going to have it easy the rest of your life. I'm already dickering again for the house I hoped to get in the first place. My first act is going to be to get you into it."

She wrote back, without mentioning the house:

"I went up to the top of the hill last night and let the breeze blow in my face for an hour while I thought of you and watched the lights come on in the valley. Oh, how I wished you were here."

A week before the grain was ready to cut, Hadfield rounded up a bunch of his hungry cattle and put them in his dry pasture above the Raines homestead.

Anne woke at dawn to hear the defiant bellowing of a range bull. Before she was out of bed, the crashing of a post and the whining of tight wires, giving way before the impact of heavy bodies, smote her ears. She sprang to her feet and ran outside. At least twenty head of hungry cattle were fanning out at the top of the wheat field, tearing it up in great bunches with their huge mouths and trampling it under foot while a score of others were coming over the ridge, bent on similar destruction.

"Whoo-oo-oo," she cried running up the hill. Halfway through the wheat, she felt her lungs burning from the exertion but kept on.

"Whoo-oo-oo," she cried again, nearing the first animal. "Get out of here! Sic 'em, get out of here!"

Whirling her hat in her hand, she attacked the animal with a fury that made her feel capable of tearing it to pieces with her bare hands.

Windy Hilltop

But the bovine giant merely ran a few paces and turned to look at her with oxlike stolidity as if wondering if she were some new kind of fly or other nuisance. She ran at another of the animals, shouting and clapping her hands. But they merely circled around in the grain, tearing more of it up with their great mouths and wallowing more under their feet.

Others were pouring in along the edge of the wheat. Anne's temples throbbed, her heartbeat choked her, and she realized with sudden terror that she was on the verge of collapse. But she couldn't stop. Something had to be done.

She wished blindly she had the power to wave her arm and strike this terrific mass of invading power dead with a single stroke. She was in the midst of the milling herd now, but danger to herself never came to her mind. Once she would have been frightened to death at the more presence of these wild, relentless animals, but at the moment, she was aware only of the havoc they were doing to her precious wheat. She was thinking of the hard work Joe had done, plowing, harrowing and planting it. She remembered the night he had come down to the corral with the dog after finishing the last round. He was as black as a negro, she had said, but as lighthearted as a schoolboy, and she had gone out to meet him in one of her most dissatisfied moods.

"Whoo-ooo," she cried. "Get out of here!"

Suddenly, the cattle stirred uneasily, as if the very desperation of her efforts had at last stricken them with fear. In a moment they began moving back out of the grain, starting at first slowly, then breaking to 265 a run.

Then, for the first time, Anne realized a dog was barking and nipping savagely at their heels. Man's voice, too, broke upon the morning stillness, echoing along the ridge like shrill thunder. She saw him ride down the gully, jumping his horse over the sagging wires, and circling around the remnants of the cattle with amazing speed.

Of course it was Hadfield. "Confound it!" he yelled, "I'll be glad when you get this wheat cut. We'll have nothing but trouble now they've found it."

He passed in a flash of speed. This long-limbed, hawklike man in a broad-brimmed hat and high-heeled boots seemed like a character riding directly out of the pages of an adventure story. How could anyone cope with him?

Anne drew her arm over her hot, perspiring face and sank down on a boulder.

A few minutes later, she was aware he had come back. "When'll Joe be home?" Hadfield demanded. "I don't know," she said. She looked up, half admiring Hadfield's magnificent strength. She could never have driven the cattle out alone. "Thanks for helping me," she murmured. "I'll fix the fence," he replied, not unkindly.

ANNE was numb with weariness when she started down through the wheat, and the morning sunshine was directly in her face. She was nearly down to the house, therefore, before she realized a car had Betsy running from the house. Realized it was time she could bring all her tired faculties to bear on the scene, she not only saw Della but also Joe getting out of the car. Then she found herself running again, her weariness forgotten.

He came toward her with the help of his cane. "Oh, Joe, Joe, darling, I'm so glad!" she cried, almost collapsing in his arms. "Sweetheart," he murmured, holding her tightly. "This has been terrible for you. But it's all over now. I've bargained for the place in town. We're going to move."

Anne braced herself with sudden alertness. "But darling, the wheat's got to be cut. I've arranged for the headers to come next week. Then of course, you know we've got to thresh. Besides there's a lot of stuff in the garden yet to dig. Why, we've got enough food to last us all winter."

"Honey, I saw you chasing those cattle when we were down in the valley, and I knew what a killing ordeal you were having. I've tried it myself. And I said to Della then, 'Sis, you're right, the meanest thing I ever did was to bring Anne out to this forsaken place." Joe's voice quivered. "But, dear, you're here now. Everything'll be easy. I don't want to leave, not yet. Our job isn't finished here. I'm a changed woman, Joe; I've learned to see so many things your way."

"And I've learned to see things your way," protested Joe. "I guess it was just stupid of me to get so attached to this place." They began to follow Della and the children to the house, but before they had gone many steps, they were aware of Hadfield riding into the yard.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948

"Hello, Joe," he said. "I'm glad to see you back, and I want to tell you this little wife of yours has sure looked after things." Hadfield leaned on the horn of his saddle and looked down into their serious faces. "I hope your legs are all right."

"They'll be as good as ever in a few more weeks," replied Joe.

"Well, how about the deal?" Hadfield came to the point. "Oh, yes, the deal for the place. Well, honestly, Mr. Hadfield, we've decided not to sell for the present, but we'll still give you a chance if we decide to later," replied Joe, reaching the decision so quickly he was half-afraid and looked at Anne to see if she approved.

"That's right," said Anne. "We're going to make ever so many improvements first, however, so we can get a good price for it."

Hadfield's face clouded. "I've already made a payment on it, you know." "Oh, yes, the check." Joe fumbled in his pocket and finally produced the one evidence of the sale. "Here it is. You see, I didn't cash it. I was able to make other arrangements for my hospital bill." He held it up, but Anne took it and tore it to bits.

"Mr. Hadfield doesn't want it. His money's all in the bank and everybody's happy," Anne laughed impudently, then hysterically, but in a moment she was crying again. "You won't try to hold us to it, will you?"

The scowl on Hadfield's hawklike face broadened into a grin. "You win," he said, "good luck."

THE sporting wind was cool and soothing when Anne and Joe reached the hilltop to watch the sun go down, and a lone hawk was spreading its wings to cut a true course directly against the current. Hand in hand, they stood silent against the benediction of the sky, surrounded by the vast solitude.

"How often I pictured this place in my mind when I was lying in the hospital," Joe said reflectively. "And were unhappy to think of losing it," prompted Anne.

Joe grinned. "Yes, I admit it."

They surveyed their rough acres, partly subdued by their toil, and a mutual pride of achievement possessed them. "Darling," said Anne, "as soon as you were hurt, and I started to feel responsible, I began to love everything here, and with you gone, I began to realize how it bound us together."

Fervently, he drew her to him. "Dear, you are wonderful. I don't believe any other man ever had such a heroic little wife. And because of that, your little cottage in town is still going to come true." She looked up questioningly.

"We're about the last of the homesteaders, and we can be thankful to have had such an opportunity. This humble heritage should always be ours and our children's. I have a good trade, and there are still other things I can do in the winter.

And, you know, we don't owe anything on this place." Anne caught the vision instantly. "What wonderful summers we'll have here while the children are growing up, and what grand things we'll raise to eat. All our friends in town will be jealous because we have a country home and a city home, too." She laughed as the wind blew her golden hair in wisps about her face. Looking up, she saw the hawk make a magnificent dive into the wind. "Our wings are set right," she murmured, putting her lips up to be kissed.

A New Coat for an Old One
Blanche N. Coe Would like to convert an old, straight coat into a new, flared model to wear with full, long dresses? By carefully following the directions given in this article, you can perform this transformation. Before you begin the remodeling process, carefully observe the way in which the bottom of the coat is finished so that you can refinish the new one in the same way.

First, make a chalk mark around the sleeve halfway between the inside of the elbow joint and the wrist joint. Cut at the chalk mark. (See Diagram A). Carefully press with a damp cloth the pieces you have cut off as you are going to use them later. Open the underarm seam of the sleeve almost to the armhole. Also open the inside seam of the lining of the sleeve almost to the armhole. Remove the padding at the top of the sleeve and at the shoulder and insert the new-style padding for the shoulder. After you have placed pad correctly, put a tailor's mitt in the top of the sleeve and shoulder, cover with a cloth wrung from warm water, and steam-press into shape.

If the material in your coat won't shrink into a nice shape, the top of the armhole seam can be opened and part of the old sleeve cut out to make it fit the new pad. With a thin piece of tailor's chalk, or a piece of soap, mark the new hemline of the coat evenly, about a quarter of an inch below the finger-tips when the hands are hanging at Page 268 the sides. Use a yardstick so that the bottom of the coat is exactly the same distance from the floor at every point. Cut on the dotted line of the chalk marks. (See Diagram A).

Diagram B represents one of the pieces cut off from each sleeve. From each piece cut a triangle (1.) with which to widen the sleeves (See Diagram C). Make a triangle pattern with paper as long as the arm seam opening and as wide as the goods allows and lay the pattern on the cloth as shown in Diagram B. Sew the flare (triangle) in place as shown in Diagram C, with the wide part of the triangle at the bottom of the sleeve.

Open the side seams of the coat and lining almost to the armhole. From the piece which you have cut off the bottom of the coat cut two flares, (triangles 2 and 3), to put into the side openings of the coat, one for each side. Also cut the circular pieces (4) to be put in the bottom of each sleeve from this same piece of material. Cut these circles as large as possible. The diagrams (D-1 and D-2) show two ways of doing this.

If the piece of material cut from the bottom of the coat is sufficiently wide, and the pattern of the material is such that it can be used crosswise, then cut as in Diagram D-1. If the pattern of the material, however, such as a stripe, cannot be used crosswise, then cut as in Diagram D-2.

Join the pieces carefully, matching the notches of 2 and 3, and press the seams well before joining them to the sides of the coat. Sew the straight side of the triangle to the front seam of the coat. Sew the circles to the bottom of the sleeves (Diagram E). Bind the inside of the circle to form a cuff at the wrist. Press all the seams carefully with a steam iron or with a cloth wrung from warm water.

Use the same pattern and method of cutting and sewing for making the lining into a flare, and for making the new lining for the sleeves. A different material may be needed to line the sleeve circle. You observed the original bottom finish on your old coat. Even the side flares and finish the new coat the same way.

And here's your new coat (Diagram F). It's Fun to Make Pie
Velma N. Simonsen Second Counselor, General Presidency of Relief Society

IT'S fun to make pie, and it is quick and easy if you use a pastry cloth and a rolling pin jacket! These can be purchased in any store, but it is much cheaper to make your own.

Buy a piece of white canvas at any farm store. The canvas comes in various widths from 30 inches to 60 inches. Two-thirds of a yard of the 30-inch canvas will make two pastry cloths. Cut the edges with pinking shears or turn a small narrow hem on the raw edges.

For the rolling pin jacket buy a small pair of child's white stockings, cut off the feet, and you have two rolling pin jackets. Pull one jacket over the rolling pin. If the stocking is too long turn the ends back in on themselves.

Before using, work or rub as much flour into the jacket and cloth as they will absorb. Do not leave excess flour on the surface. Also use the cloth and jacket to roll cookies, doughnuts, rolls, noodles, or any rolled dough. With this pastry cloth and rolling pin jacket you can handle a much softer dough as they never stick and the dough to the board and the rolling pin. They also eliminate frequent adding of flour when making pastry, thereby assuring you of lighter and more tender pie crusts.

Have you ever tried hot water pie crust? Here is a never-fail recipe:

1 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup shortening
1 cup boiling water

Pour boiling water over shortening and beat until creamy. Sift in flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir and roll out. Makes 2 crusts.

Many recipes advise chilling in the ice box, but with a pastry cloth this is unnecessary, and warm dough is easier to handle and makes a more flaky crust.

Bake at oven temperature suitable for the type and size of the pie, between 400° and 550° F.

The "Basic-Seven" Pattern for Nutrition
Bernice Stookey Linford Iron County, Utah, Home Agent

PHYSICAL health is necessary for mental and spiritual growth and well-being. We eat food primarily for nutrition. Food at best is expensive, but malnutrition is often found in families which spend the most money for food. This may be due to lack of information and poor selection or preparation. Many overweight people are malnourished because they do not have a balanced diet.

A food pattern for health is definitely included in the Word of Wisdom, as well as the harmful effects of the use of liquor, tobacco, tea, coffee, and drug-containing drinks.
". . . all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man—Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly . . . . All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth (D. & C. 89:10 ff.)."

"In the season thereof" may, in my opinion, refer to natural foods at proper maturity—fresh or properly preserved.

Each day we read warnings written by food specialists urging us to eat more natural foods, not only to ensure health, but to build resistance against disease. Disease always follows or goes hand in hand with hunger, the aftermath of war.

Vitamins are vital substances found in natural, fresh, and properly prepared foods. They regulate body processes and build up resistance against disease. "The destroying angel shall pass by them"—can this not mean that health could be so fortified that disease germs could be thrown from the body? Vitamin D, so potent in protecting health, is manufactured in the body by exposing the skin to direct sunlight.

Food, "in the season thereof," eaten raw, cooked, canned, or frozen, is rich in vitamins. The cost, in many cases, can be reduced more than 100%, and the food is more wholesome and better flavored if prepared at home. A well-balanced diet, including, each day, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, mineral salts, vitamins, and water will supply body needs without adding synthetic vitamins.

The following "basic-seven" pattern is recommended by the National Food and Nutrition Board. It is recognized as an ideal health pattern. Include some foods from each group in the diet each day.
MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS
Fluid milk (adults, 1 pint; children, ½ to 1 quart; expectant and nursing mothers, 1 quart)
If fluid milk is unavailable or unsafe,
Page 271 a 1-pint can of evaporated milk or ¼ cup dried milk are equivalent to 1 quart fluid milk. Ice cream and various types of cheese, too, can be used to make up this group—American cheese, and cottage cheese.

GREEN AND YELLOW VEGETABLES (One or more servings)
Cabbage
Broccoli
Lettuce
Carrots
Spinach
Sweet Potatoes
Asparagus
Yellow squash
Peas
Pumpkin
Beans
Yellow turnips

ORANGES, TOMATOES, GRAPEFRUIT (One or more servings)
Fresh or canned juices
Raw cabbage
Raw vegetables in salad

POTATOES AND OTHER VEGETABLES AND FRUITS (One or more servings)
Potatoes (at least once daily)
Grapes (fresh or canned, frozen beans or dried)
Cauliflower
Berries
Onions
Melons
Com Cantaloupes
Turnips
Peaches
Pears
Dates
Apples
Figs
Radishes
Prunes

MEAT, POULTRY, FISH, ECEs (One serving of meat, poultry, or fish daily)
One egg daily (at least four a week)
Dried beans: (an excellent source of calcium, as well as of minerals and protein )
Peas
Nuts
Peanut Butter

BREAD, FLOUR AND CEREALS (Enriched or whole-grain)
Bread, or its equivalent at each meal, according to age and energy needs of the individual.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948
BUTTER AND FORTIFIED MARGARINE VITAMIN A ADDED
Two to three level tablespoons. Serve some with each meal.
Other animal and vegetable fats as needed.
Six to eight glasses of water should be included in each daily diet. A glass of warm water taken early in the morning is beneficial.
'The juice of one half lemon added to the water and taken thirty minutes before breakfast, before any food is taken into the body, is an effective regulator and also corrects bad Families with low incomes may find it impossible to include as much meat, poultry, and butter as desired, but in all diets it is recommended to include liver, heart, or kidney, at least once a week.
Liver is our most valuable meat. Liver from calves, beef, pork, or sheep is similar in nutritive value. The milder the flavor, the higher the price. Stronger flavored liver may be ground and sage, onion, celery, and bread crumbs added to make liver loaf.
If changes must be made because of low income, natural molasses, soybeans, dried beans and peas, peanut butter, and rice—especially brown rice—should be included often. Increase the use of whole grains, as whole-wheat cereals and breads. Serve more fruits and vegetables, fresh, canned, frozen, or dried.
But most important, increase milk and milk products. Milk is our most perfect food. It supplies energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals. It is our best insurance against diet deficiencies. It is also our best source of calcium, which is essential for the functioning of every cell in the body, for building teeth, bones, and blood, and for all body processes.
When meat, cheese, and fluid milk are scarce, or unsafe because cows are not properly tested, dried milk can be used. Dried whole milk should be kept under refrigeration, since the fat becomes rancid. Dried skimmed milk may be used in many ways and is very reasonable in price. One half cup of dried milk contains milk solids equal to one quart of fresh milk.
Use it in creamed soups, breads, gravies, puddings, ice cream, cookies, and add it to cooked YELLOW VEGETABLES. Cereals.
Dried milk has the advantage, too, that an extra amount can be added, if necessary, for protection of health. For cooking, it is much easier and quicker to measure out the amount needed for the recipe, then mix or sift the dried milk with the dry ingredients, instead of putting it in with the moisture, as is usually done in recipes. The particles of milk absorb moisture very slowly; it takes a long time for the milk, if mixed with water, to make a smooth paste, but it can be done quickly by putting milk in a small (Continued on page 285)

FROM THE FIELD
Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer

REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUBMITTAL OF MATERIAL FOR "NOTES FROM THE FIELD"
(All notes and photographs are to be submitted through stake and mission Relief Society presidents).

This section of the Magazine is reserved for narrative reports and pictures of Relief Society activities in the stakes and missions.

Its purpose is threefold: (1) to provide a medium for the exchange of ideas and methods for conducting Relief Society work which have proved successful in some organizations and which may be helpful and stimulating to others; (2) to recognize outstanding or unique accomplishments of Relief Society organizations; (3) to note the progress of Relief Society work in various parts of the world. It is recognized that personal accounts of individuals who have long served Relief Society, or who have otherwise distinguished themselves, are always of great interest, but the space available for "Notes From the Field" is so limited in relation to the number of stakes and missions that it must be reserved for reports on the work of the organization rather than that of individuals. Wards and branches desiring to submit reports for publication in "Notes From the Field" are requested to send them through the stake or mission presidents. It often happens that one or two wards or branches in a stake or mission will send reports on special activities which are being conducted on a stake-wide or mission-wide basis, and, in such instances, it would be to the advantage of the stake or mission to have the report cover the entire activity in the same issue of the Magazine, with all participating wards or branches represented. Reports and photographs should be submitted as promptly as possible after the events described have taken place in order that they may be published while the activities are still of current interest. Where narrative reports are submitted, with or without accompanying photographs, the name of the stake and ward, or mission and branch, should be given together with the title of the activity reported, the date, and other pertinent data, including the name, address, and position of the person making the report. Pictures which are submitted for publication can be used only if they are clear and distinct and will make good cuts for reproduction. Black and white glossy prints reproduce most satisfactorily. Pictures should have the following information written clearly on the back: Name of stake and ward, or mission and branch Title of picture, stating the activity represented or the purpose Date picture was taken Name, address, and position in Relief Society of person submitting the picture Identification of persons in the picture should be made on the reverse side. Names should be given from left to right, written clearly, and spelled correctly. The given names of the women should be used, not their husbands' names (for instance, Sarah D. Erickson, not Mrs. James Erickson). The positions of the executive officers: president, counselors, and secretary-treasurer If the photograph has reference to some particular activity, such as sewing, visiting teaching, etc., the name of the leader and her position should also be listed. Material submitted for "Notes From the Field" should be addressed to the General Secretary-Treasurer of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah.

Sister Mae Matis reports that none of the articles in this bazaar were made from new material and yet each article was beautifully made and will be very serviceable. In commenting upon the activities of our Finnish sisters, President Matis writes: "From this faraway country the sisters of the Relief Society send their choicest greetings.... We now have four active Relief Society groups in Finland, at Helsinki, Turku, Larsmo, and Jacobstad. All the sisters are willing and anxious to do their part and we are looking forward with a great deal of anticipation.

'Two of the groups held bazaars in December. I admired their spirit to even try with so little material to work with. It is impossible to buy material or yarn of any kind here. The sisters unraveled old sweaters, socks, and shawls which had already been made over several times and remade them. They were happy with their efforts and it was a goal for them to work toward."

(Worse, she had forgotten his birthday. She had forgotten everything but this. She looked critically at the paper, and for a moment her heart pounded with pride; but even work socks would have been better than nothing. In quick anger, she started to tear the paper across. No-o. No. This was Starlight. Strangers had lost the stallion, but she had him. He could never run away from her. Run away? She could find the Indian camp. The Indians liked her as she was. They wouldn't expect her to earn money, but she couldn't leave Papa, no matter what.)

THE family was at the supper table when she stumbled into the kitchen, tired and heartsick. Immediately three pairs of eyes were turned toward her. "Was Mrs. Home late getting home?" Marie asked. "I didn't see her in town." "Likely they were at Stangers," Levi said. "I heard they caught Starlight." "See the package Mama sent and Papa likes his hat so well he won't take it off," Marie added.

Gloria wet her lips with her tongue. The hat was wonderful. Papa cocked his head to one side to show off. The fun in his eyes was more than she could stand. "Did you lose your tongue?" Levi demanded, "I know," Marie's voice took on that know-it-all tone. "She has her pencils. You didn't buy Papa a birthday present, did you?"

The old pec'cy pain tightened inside Gloria. Her eyes stung and her heart was broken in two, but she would not let Marie know. "Course, I brought him something." "Where is it? Why don't you give it to him?" They all waited. She kept her eyes away from Papa. If only she had found a horse— if only she had tried to find one, but she hadn't remembered.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�APRIL 1948 "Did you lead him home or did he just follow you?" The defiance in Gloria crumbled fast. Her nostrils flared, but her head was high and her voice steady. "Here he is, Papa." The sudden stillness was horrible. Papa held the paper before him.

He pushed back his hat to get the benefit of the fading light. Marie and Levi were back of him, looking over his shoulder. Gloria waited. If he would scold her she could stand it. "Glory! Glory!" was all he said, and in a frenzy of regret she threw herself into his arms. "I do love you, Papa," she sobbed. "Don't believe her when she says I don't love you. I love you more than all the world." One hand still held the paper to the light, and it was trembling. With the other arm, he drew her close against him. There was a queer note in his voice when he spoke, as if he were laughing and crying at the same time. "Glory, you have killed my pecancy humor. We shall never use the word again." Marie and Levi exchanged glances. This was queer talk, even for Papa. "It is good, isn't it? I mean really - good?" Marie had forgotten her impatience. "I'll bet anyone who has seen Starlight would recognize it," Levi added. 

Papa spoke to all of them. "Some day this sketch will be exhibited as an example of the early work of a famous painter of animals in action. This is the most precious gift a man ever received." Gloria looked into his eyes and THE GIFT knew that something very special had happened to him, and it was her drawing that had done it. Once again that pain swelled and swelled inside her, but it was not pec'cy anymore.

The Basic-Seven Pattern for Nutrition (Continued from page 273)

To thicken soups, add a small amount of flour or cornstarch to cold water in a separate bowl, mix well, then stir into the soup. Use a wooden spoon to blend thoroughly. For gravies and sauces, use the same method but add more thickener as needed.

Whole-wheat cereals and flour, brown, unpolished rice, oats, and other whole-grain products contain the "enrichment and vitamins" nature produced in them. They are more valuable as food and less expensive than synthetically enriched flours and cereals.

Far-sighted home-makers will protect health by including daily in the family diet milk and milk products; fruit and vegetables; meats, fish, cheese, or eggs; cereals, whole-grain or enriched breads; butter, margarine, or other animal and vegetable fats. They will reduce expense by planting gardens and preserving food at home.

With "prudence and thanksgiving," they will gather the harvest in the time of plenty "in the season thereof" and store it for the lean days to come.

They're still entangled with my dreams.
