A New Coat for an Old One
Blanche N. Coe Would like to convert an old, straight coat into a new, flared model to wear with full, long dresses? By carefully following the directions given in this article, you can perform this transformation. Before you begin the remodeling process, carefully observe the way in which the bottom of the coat is finished so that you can refinish the new one in the same way.

First, make a chalk mark around the sleeve halfway between the inside of the elbow joint and the wrist joint. Cut at the chalk mark. (See Diagram A). Carefully press with a damp cloth the pieces you have cut off as you are going to use them later. Open the underarm seam of the sleeve almost to the armhole. Also open the inside seam of the lining of the sleeve almost to the armhole. Remove the padding at the top of the sleeve and at the shoulder and insert the new-style padding for the shoulder. After you have placed pad correctly, put a tailor's mitt in the top of the sleeve and shoulder, cover with a cloth wrung from warm water, and steam-press into shape.

If the material in your coat won't shrink into a nice shape, the top of the armhole seam can be opened and part of the old sleeve cut out to make it fit the new pad. With a thin piece of tailor's chalk, or a piece of soap, mark the new hemline of the coat evenly, about a quarter of an inch below the finger-tips when the hands are hanging at Page 268 the sides. Use a yardstick so that the bottom of the coat is exactly the same distance from the floor at every point. Cut on the dotted line of the chalk marks. (See Diagram A).

Diagram B represents one of the pieces cut off from each sleeve. From each piece cut a triangle (1.) with which to widen the sleeves (See Diagram C). Make a triangle pattern with paper as long as the arm seam opening and as wide as the goods allows and lay the pattern on the cloth as shown in Diagram B. Sew the flare (triangle) in place as shown in Diagram C, with the wide part of the triangle at the bottom of the sleeve.

Open the side seams of the coat and lining almost to the armhole. From the piece which you have cut off the bottom of the coat cut two flares, (triangles 2 and 3), to put into the side openings of the coat, one for each side. Also cut the circular pieces (4) to be put in the bottom of each sleeve from this same piece of material. Cut these circles as large as possible. The diagrams (D-1 and D-2) show two ways of doing this.

If the piece of material cut from the bottom of the coat is sufficiently wide, and the pattern of the material is such that it can be used crosswise, then cut as in Diagram D-1. If the pattern of the material, however, such as a stripe, cannot be used crosswise, then cut as in Diagram D-2.

Join the pieces carefully, matching the notches of 2 and 3, and press the seams well before joining them to the sides of the coat. Sew the straight side of the triangle to the front seam of the coat. Sew the circles to the bottom of the sleeves (Diagram E). Bind the inside of the circle to form a cuff at the wrist. Press all the seams carefully with a steam iron or with a cloth wrung from warm water.

Use the same pattern and method of cutting and sewing for making the lining into a flare, and for making the new lining for the sleeves. A different material may be needed to line the sleeve circle. You observed the original bottom finish on your old coat. Even the side flares and finish the new coat the same way.

And here's your new coat (Diagram F). It's Fun to Make Pie
Velma N. Simonsen Second Counselor, General Presidency of Relief Society

IT'S fun to make pie, and it is quick and easy if you use a pastry cloth and a rolling pin jacket! These can be purchased in any store, but it is much cheaper to make your own.

Buy a piece of white canvas at any farm store. The canvas comes in various widths from 30 inches to 60 inches. Two-thirds of a yard of the 30-inch canvas will make two pastry cloths. Cut the edges with pinking shears or turn a small narrow hem on the raw edges.

For the rolling pin jacket buy a small pair of child's white stockings, cut off the feet, and you have two rolling pin jackets. Pull one jacket over the rolling pin. If the stocking is too long turn the ends back in on themselves.

Before using, work or rub as much flour into the jacket and cloth as they will absorb. Do not leave excess flour on the surface. Also use the cloth and jacket to roll cookies, doughnuts, rolls, noodles, or any rolled dough. With this pastry cloth and rolling pin jacket you can handle a much softer dough as they never stick and the dough to the board and the rolling pin. They also eliminate frequent adding of flour when making pastry, thereby assuring you of lighter and more tender pie crusts.

Have you ever tried hot water pie crust? Here is a never-fail recipe:

1 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup shortening
1 cup boiling water

Pour boiling water over shortening and beat until creamy. Sift in flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir and roll out. Makes 2 crusts.

Many recipes advise chilling in the ice box, but with a pastry cloth this is unnecessary, and warm dough is easier to handle and makes a more flaky crust.

Bake at oven temperature suitable for the type and size of the pie, between 400° and 550° F.

The "Basic-Seven" Pattern for Nutrition
Bernice Stookey Linford Iron County, Utah, Home Agent

PHYSICAL health is necessary for mental and spiritual growth and well-being. We eat food primarily for nutrition. Food at best is expensive, but malnutrition is often found in families which spend the most money for food. This may be due to lack of information and poor selection or preparation. Many overweight people are malnourished because they do not have a balanced diet.

A food pattern for health is definitely included in the Word of Wisdom, as well as the harmful effects of the use of liquor, tobacco, tea, coffee, and drug-containing drinks.
". . . all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man—Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly . . . . All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth (D. & C. 89:10 ff.)."

"In the season thereof" may, in my opinion, refer to natural foods at proper maturity—fresh or properly preserved.

Each day we read warnings written by food specialists urging us to eat more natural foods, not only to ensure health, but to build resistance against disease. Disease always follows or goes hand in hand with hunger, the aftermath of war.

Vitamins are vital substances found in natural, fresh, and properly prepared foods. They regulate body processes and build up resistance against disease. "The destroying angel shall pass by them"—can this not mean that health could be so fortified that disease germs could be thrown from the body? Vitamin D, so potent in protecting health, is manufactured in the body by exposing the skin to direct sunlight.

Food, "in the season thereof," eaten raw, cooked, canned, or frozen, is rich in vitamins. The cost, in many cases, can be reduced more than 100%, and the food is more wholesome and better flavored if prepared at home. A well-balanced diet, including, each day, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, mineral salts, vitamins, and water will supply body needs without adding synthetic vitamins.

The following "basic-seven" pattern is recommended by the National Food and Nutrition Board. It is recognized as an ideal health pattern. Include some foods from each group in the diet each day.
MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS
Fluid milk (adults, 1 pint; children, ½ to 1 quart; expectant and nursing mothers, 1 quart)
If fluid milk is unavailable or unsafe,
Page 271 a 1-pint can of evaporated milk or ¼ cup dried milk are equivalent to 1 quart fluid milk. Ice cream and various types of cheese, too, can be used to make up this group—American cheese, and cottage cheese.

GREEN AND YELLOW VEGETABLES (One or more servings)
Cabbage
Broccoli
Lettuce
Carrots
Spinach
Sweet Potatoes
Asparagus
Yellow squash
Peas
Pumpkin
Beans
Yellow turnips

ORANGES, TOMATOES, GRAPEFRUIT (One or more servings)
Fresh or canned juices
Raw cabbage
Raw vegetables in salad

POTATOES AND OTHER VEGETABLES AND FRUITS (One or more servings)
Potatoes (at least once daily)
Grapes (fresh or canned, frozen beans or dried)
Cauliflower
Berries
Onions
Melons
Com Cantaloupes
Turnips
Peaches
Pears
Dates
Apples
Figs
Radishes
Prunes

MEAT, POULTRY, FISH, ECEs (One serving of meat, poultry, or fish daily)
One egg daily (at least four a week)
Dried beans: (an excellent source of calcium, as well as of minerals and protein )
Peas
Nuts
Peanut Butter

BREAD, FLOUR AND CEREALS (Enriched or whole-grain)
Bread, or its equivalent at each meal, according to age and energy needs of the individual.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948
BUTTER AND FORTIFIED MARGARINE VITAMIN A ADDED
Two to three level tablespoons. Serve some with each meal.
Other animal and vegetable fats as needed.
Six to eight glasses of water should be included in each daily diet. A glass of warm water taken early in the morning is beneficial.
'The juice of one half lemon added to the water and taken thirty minutes before breakfast, before any food is taken into the body, is an effective regulator and also corrects bad Families with low incomes may find it impossible to include as much meat, poultry, and butter as desired, but in all diets it is recommended to include liver, heart, or kidney, at least once a week.
Liver is our most valuable meat. Liver from calves, beef, pork, or sheep is similar in nutritive value. The milder the flavor, the higher the price. Stronger flavored liver may be ground and sage, onion, celery, and bread crumbs added to make liver loaf.
If changes must be made because of low income, natural molasses, soybeans, dried beans and peas, peanut butter, and rice—especially brown rice—should be included often. Increase the use of whole grains, as whole-wheat cereals and breads. Serve more fruits and vegetables, fresh, canned, frozen, or dried.
But most important, increase milk and milk products. Milk is our most perfect food. It supplies energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals. It is our best insurance against diet deficiencies. It is also our best source of calcium, which is essential for the functioning of every cell in the body, for building teeth, bones, and blood, and for all body processes.
When meat, cheese, and fluid milk are scarce, or unsafe because cows are not properly tested, dried milk can be used. Dried whole milk should be kept under refrigeration, since the fat becomes rancid. Dried skimmed milk may be used in many ways and is very reasonable in price. One half cup of dried milk contains milk solids equal to one quart of fresh milk.
Use it in creamed soups, breads, gravies, puddings, ice cream, cookies, and add it to cooked YELLOW VEGETABLES. Cereals.
Dried milk has the advantage, too, that an extra amount can be added, if necessary, for protection of health. For cooking, it is much easier and quicker to measure out the amount needed for the recipe, then mix or sift the dried milk with the dry ingredients, instead of putting it in with the moisture, as is usually done in recipes. The particles of milk absorb moisture very slowly; it takes a long time for the milk, if mixed with water, to make a smooth paste, but it can be done quickly by putting milk in a small (Continued on page 285)

FROM THE FIELD
Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer

REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUBMITTAL OF MATERIAL FOR "NOTES FROM THE FIELD"
(All notes and photographs are to be submitted through stake and mission Relief Society presidents).

This section of the Magazine is reserved for narrative reports and pictures of Relief Society activities in the stakes and missions.

Its purpose is threefold: (1) to provide a medium for the exchange of ideas and methods for conducting Relief Society work which have proved successful in some organizations and which may be helpful and stimulating to others; (2) to recognize outstanding or unique accomplishments of Relief Society organizations; (3) to note the progress of Relief Society work in various parts of the world. It is recognized that personal accounts of individuals who have long served Relief Society, or who have otherwise distinguished themselves, are always of great interest, but the space available for "Notes From the Field" is so limited in relation to the number of stakes and missions that it must be reserved for reports on the work of the organization rather than that of individuals. Wards and branches desiring to submit reports for publication in "Notes From the Field" are requested to send them through the stake or mission presidents. It often happens that one or two wards or branches in a stake or mission will send reports on special activities which are being conducted on a stake-wide or mission-wide basis, and, in such instances, it would be to the advantage of the stake or mission to have the report cover the entire activity in the same issue of the Magazine, with all participating wards or branches represented. Reports and photographs should be submitted as promptly as possible after the events described have taken place in order that they may be published while the activities are still of current interest. Where narrative reports are submitted, with or without accompanying photographs, the name of the stake and ward, or mission and branch, should be given together with the title of the activity reported, the date, and other pertinent data, including the name, address, and position of the person making the report. Pictures which are submitted for publication can be used only if they are clear and distinct and will make good cuts for reproduction. Black and white glossy prints reproduce most satisfactorily. Pictures should have the following information written clearly on the back: Name of stake and ward, or mission and branch Title of picture, stating the activity represented or the purpose Date picture was taken Name, address, and position in Relief Society of person submitting the picture Identification of persons in the picture should be made on the reverse side. Names should be given from left to right, written clearly, and spelled correctly. The given names of the women should be used, not their husbands' names (for instance, Sarah D. Erickson, not Mrs. James Erickson). The positions of the executive officers: president, counselors, and secretary-treasurer If the photograph has reference to some particular activity, such as sewing, visiting teaching, etc., the name of the leader and her position should also be listed. Material submitted for "Notes From the Field" should be addressed to the General Secretary-Treasurer of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah.

Sister Mae Matis reports that none of the articles in this bazaar were made from new material and yet each article was beautifully made and will be very serviceable. In commenting upon the activities of our Finnish sisters, President Matis writes: "From this faraway country the sisters of the Relief Society send their choicest greetings.... We now have four active Relief Society groups in Finland, at Helsinki, Turku, Larsmo, and Jacobstad. All the sisters are willing and anxious to do their part and we are looking forward with a great deal of anticipation.

'Two of the groups held bazaars in December. I admired their spirit to even try with so little material to work with. It is impossible to buy material or yarn of any kind here. The sisters unraveled old sweaters, socks, and shawls which had already been made over several times and remade them. They were happy with their efforts and it was a goal for them to work toward."

(Worse, she had forgotten his birthday. She had forgotten everything but this. She looked critically at the paper, and for a moment her heart pounded with pride; but even work socks would have been better than nothing. In quick anger, she started to tear the paper across. No-o. No. This was Starlight. Strangers had lost the stallion, but she had him. He could never run away from her. Run away? She could find the Indian camp. The Indians liked her as she was. They wouldn't expect her to earn money, but she couldn't leave Papa, no matter what.)

THE family was at the supper table when she stumbled into the kitchen, tired and heartsick. Immediately three pairs of eyes were turned toward her. "Was Mrs. Home late getting home?" Marie asked. "I didn't see her in town." "Likely they were at Stangers," Levi said. "I heard they caught Starlight." "See the package Mama sent and Papa likes his hat so well he won't take it off," Marie added.

Gloria wet her lips with her tongue. The hat was wonderful. Papa cocked his head to one side to show off. The fun in his eyes was more than she could stand. "Did you lose your tongue?" Levi demanded, "I know," Marie's voice took on that know-it-all tone. "She has her pencils. You didn't buy Papa a birthday present, did you?"

The old pec'cy pain tightened inside Gloria. Her eyes stung and her heart was broken in two, but she would not let Marie know. "Course, I brought him something." "Where is it? Why don't you give it to him?" They all waited. She kept her eyes away from Papa. If only she had found a horse— if only she had tried to find one, but she hadn't remembered.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�APRIL 1948 "Did you lead him home or did he just follow you?" The defiance in Gloria crumbled fast. Her nostrils flared, but her head was high and her voice steady. "Here he is, Papa." The sudden stillness was horrible. Papa held the paper before him.

He pushed back his hat to get the benefit of the fading light. Marie and Levi were back of him, looking over his shoulder. Gloria waited. If he would scold her she could stand it. "Glory! Glory!" was all he said, and in a frenzy of regret she threw herself into his arms. "I do love you, Papa," she sobbed. "Don't believe her when she says I don't love you. I love you more than all the world." One hand still held the paper to the light, and it was trembling. With the other arm, he drew her close against him. There was a queer note in his voice when he spoke, as if he were laughing and crying at the same time. "Glory, you have killed my pecancy humor. We shall never use the word again." Marie and Levi exchanged glances. This was queer talk, even for Papa. "It is good, isn't it? I mean really - good?" Marie had forgotten her impatience. "I'll bet anyone who has seen Starlight would recognize it," Levi added. 

Papa spoke to all of them. "Some day this sketch will be exhibited as an example of the early work of a famous painter of animals in action. This is the most precious gift a man ever received." Gloria looked into his eyes and THE GIFT knew that something very special had happened to him, and it was her drawing that had done it. Once again that pain swelled and swelled inside her, but it was not pec'cy anymore.

The Basic-Seven Pattern for Nutrition (Continued from page 273)

To thicken soups, add a small amount of flour or cornstarch to cold water in a separate bowl, mix well, then stir into the soup. Use a wooden spoon to blend thoroughly. For gravies and sauces, use the same method but add more thickener as needed.

Whole-wheat cereals and flour, brown, unpolished rice, oats, and other whole-grain products contain the "enrichment and vitamins" nature produced in them. They are more valuable as food and less expensive than synthetically enriched flours and cereals.

Far-sighted home-makers will protect health by including daily in the family diet milk and milk products; fruit and vegetables; meats, fish, cheese, or eggs; cereals, whole-grain or enriched breads; butter, margarine, or other animal and vegetable fats. They will reduce expense by planting gardens and preserving food at home.

With "prudence and thanksgiving," they will gather the harvest in the time of plenty "in the season thereof" and store it for the lean days to come.
