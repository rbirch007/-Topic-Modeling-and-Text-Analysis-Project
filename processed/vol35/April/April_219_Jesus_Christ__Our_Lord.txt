Jesus Christ, Our Lord Elder Don B. Colton Director, Missionary Home, Salt Lake City, Utah NOW if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised. And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable" (I Cor. 15:12-19). It is safe to say that all well-informed people now accept without question the historical fact that Jesus, surnamed the Christ, was born in Bethlehem of Judea at the beginning of what is known as the Christian era. There are grave differences of opinion as to who and what he was. Those who accept the Bible as the work of divinely inspired men have little difficulty in showing that his coming was revealed centuries before the event occurred. However, it is doubtful whether, without revelation, the divinity of the Savior can be incontrovertibly proved. The Lord does not work that way. Without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him (Heb. 11:6). No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost (I Cor. 12:3). One having the gift of the Holy Ghost may know. The Lord and his apostles stated clearly the steps that are necessary for us to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. On the day of Pentecost, when many "were pricked in their hearts," they "said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (Acts 2:37-8). Faith, repentance, and baptism by immersion in water by one having authority must all precede the gift of the Holy Ghost, and therefore, precede the knowledge that Jesus is the Lord. The writer is mindful that the power of the Holy Ghost manifests to faithful seekers the truth concerning God. "By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things." That power works upon us. We feel its convincing influence, but it may depart from us unless we obey the Lawgiver from heaven and take the steps necessary for us to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Page 219 220 We should be always grateful that faith is necessary. Those who find must diligently seek. The reward for diligent search and research is the scientific and reasonable way. Great scientists tell us that prior to the discovery of great truths they have worked earnestly for long periods of time. Suddenly a great truth would come to them as a flood of light. They then proceeded to prove the new idea. That is what the true religionist does. He seeks earnestly for a knowledge of God. He shows his willingness to do the things required of him by obeying God's laws. In solemn and sincere prayer he asks God for a testimony. It works. He finds that for which he is seeking and knows that he has found it. Is it not the better way? Why should we expect that some man will incontrovertibly prove that God lives and that Jesus is our Savior and deny to all the rest of us the joy of seeking and the glorious joy of reward after we have found it? There are only one or two exceptions to this general rule. Cornelius is one notable exception (Acts 10). This was for a purpose and the Lord has revealed in our day that if Cornelius had not later been baptized the Holy Ghost would have departed from him. May We Find and Know? HERE are many facts which may be cited, all of which tend to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was divine. Among these we should probably name first his teachings. Did ever man teach as he taught? A ruler of the Jews said to Jesus, "We know that thou art a teacher come from God" (John 3:2). RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948

And there were great and marvelous works wrought by the disciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did heal the sick and raise the dead.... And cause the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and all manner of miracles did they work among the children of men; and in nothing did they work miracles save it were in the name of Jesus.... And the Lord did prosper them exceedingly in the land; JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD yea, insomuch that they did build cities again where there had been cities burned.
And it came to pass that there was no contention among all the people, in all the land; but there were mighty miracles wrought among the disciples of Jesus. And it came to pass that there was no contention . . . . in all the land . . . . because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God (4 Nephi, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 15, 16, 17).
If a way of life proved practical for two hundred years, who will say that it cannot be made to work?
The careful student of the teachings of Jesus comes irresistibly to the conclusion that the only way to save this war-weary world is to adhere to those teachings. Only by living the Master's teachings can peace ever be achieved.
This writer was speaking one night in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and quoted the following scripture:
Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you. But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God. And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them . . . . for the intent to do good— to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted (Jacob 2:17-19).
At the close of the meeting a learned man came up and asked the source of the quotation. After reading it, he said: "If the people of the world would live that law, war would soon be a thing of the past. Selfishness, greed, and envy cause most human suffering than all of the other ills of life combined."
Just now earnest men and women are studying ways of securing universal peace, but they are overlooking the one and only means by which it may be attained. Jesus, the greatest of all teachers, unfolded a gospel plan which, if lived, would bring peace to this world. The crying need of this generation is that people everywhere will study the gospel of the Savior. Dr. Carl F. Eyring has well said:
The formula for peace which Jesus offers is not to be ushered in with the boisterous blowing of trumpets or to be heralded by assembled potentates or marching armies, but it is to begin at Jesus so clearly stated, as a leaven which leavens the whole loaf. Permanent peace, as he tells us, must first of all be born and nourished as a way of life in the souls of individual members of his growing kingdom. Peacemakers, then, must be teachers—teachers who are willing to teach the gospel and emulate the method of the Master Teacher (Good Tidings to All People).
If nations will follow the Master's teachings a new anthem will be sung: "Glory to God in the highest and on earth, peace, good will toward men!" That anthem, if sung under those conditions, would be the sweetest music of all the ages.
The Savior's Influence on Human Life
Following his resurrection and in preparation for his leaving them, Jesus gave his apostles detailed instructions:
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 222 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world (Matt. 28:19-20). In obedience to that injunction those apostles gave up everything dear to them and spent their lives teaching people everywhere they went that Jesus is the God of this world. After enduring great hardships and persecution, most of them _ gave their lives as a final testimony of the life, death, and resurrection of the Lord. Hundreds and thousands of their converts did the same thing. Surely those who knew him best believed him divine. We need go no further than the lives of the noble pioneers who came West for the sake of the gospel to find examples of the effect of Christ's teachings upon the human heart. If they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city (Heb. 11:15-16). If we study his personal life, we find exhibition of the noblest in life. "He went about doing good." While miracles are not always proof of divine power, their absence shows lack of that power. The magicians of Egypt imitated, in a small way, the miracles performed by Moses. The careful student, however, notes the difference in power and majesty. The miracles performed by Jesus were all for the blessing and comfort of the people. His was not a "black art," practiced to deceive. He exercised divine power for the comfort and blessing of people.
RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948

Go to the grief-stricken mother who has put her trust in God and try to convince her that Jesus is only a great teacher or a great man. She knows better. His divine influence has uplifted her, and she knows it. Read of the experience of Zacchaeus as recorded in Luke, chapter 19, if you doubt the power of Jesus over the human heart. Have not Christian men and women been the greatest benefactors of the human race? Florence Nightingale, the founder of Red Cross work and the hospitalizing of wounded soldiers on battlefields, was a firm believer in Christ and was inspired by His mercy and humanitarianism.

JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD

The man who rendered such splendid service in making it possible for every boy and girl in America to get at least a common school education was a devout follower of the Master. Lincoln was changed from a disbeliever to one who believed and trusted the Savior as the greatest power in the universe. Is it possible that all the Christian agencies for good during nearly two thousand years have all been set in motion by a fraud? He said he was God, All of His actions, all of His teachings, the whole scheme of the Christian religion are built on that premise. If you take away the foundation, the building will fall. He cannot be a deceiver and a God at the same time. The two ideas are wholly incompatible.

Jesus Was a God

It is basic in the philosophy of the Latter-day Saints that Jesus created this world. "The Father gave him power before the earth was created. He became perfect through obedience, service, and sacrifice. We cannot fully understand why, because he was a God, that he should choose to live a human life and die a human death: Such was his choice, however." "All things have been done in the wisdom of Him who knoweth all things."

Paul gives us one of the most impressive and all-inclusive testimonies we have concerning Jesus the Christ:

Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature. For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, beginning with Him, the firstborn from the dead that in all things He might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father (Col. 1:12-19).

Testimonies That Christ Lives

Long before the Lord was born of the virgin Mary, Job said, quoting from the Douay version:

For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth. And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I shall see my God. Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another: this my hope is laid up in my bosom.

(Joseph Fielding Smith, Restoration of All Things).

In this our day, a glorious testimony has been given:

And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of Him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of Him: That He lives! For we saw Him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that He is the Only Begotten of the Father—that by Him, and through Him, and of Him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God (D&C 76:22-24).

Latter-day Saints should be deeply grateful for this truth:

"O the sweet joy this sentence gives, I know that my Redeemer lives."

Thousands of honest, God-fearing people in the Church solemnly affirm:

"I know He lives."

The Gift

Dorothy Clapp Robinson

"Uh-huh." Gloria did not raise her eyes. In this book Papa had borrowed there were six illustrated pages of horses. Just horses. She could draw everyone of them by heart, if she wanted. She would draw them when Marie gave her pencils back to her. She could draw Starlight, too, by heart, but not very well, for she had never been close enough to him.

"Gloria, get your nose out of that book; and you can't take it with you." Marie stooped impatiently and took the book from the floor. Gloria rolled over on her back.

"Why don't you go?" she asked her sister hopefully.

"Gloria Amold, you are working for Mrs. Horne this afternoon, so you can earn money to buy Papa a birthday present."

"And you will have to hurry if you get the money earned and spent," her brother Levi spoke over a huge slice of bread and honey. "This is his birthday, and it is ten miles to the store."

"Yes," Marie added, "this is your very last chance. If you hadn't been so selfish you could have been going with us."

Nothing she ever did was right; and the old pec'cy pain began gnawing at Gloria's heart so that her breath came fast and hot. She put her fingers in her ears. That always made Marie furious, but because Marie was twelve and the boss while Mama was away she thought she could say anything.

Gloria wished she was like Marie, then she wouldn't be having this pain—no, no, she didn't either; but Marie was a worker, and all the valley people said how wonderful she was to take hold.

"We are going to get him a wide-rimmed straw hat that will keep the sun from his eyes." Since Gloria hadn't asked what their present was to be, Marie felt an urge to offer the information.

"And if we have money enough we will get some work socks," Levi added, "that is, unless you want to get them."

"Work socks—ugh!" Gloria knew at once she should not have said that, and it did ease her pain a little, but it started Marie again.

"At least we are getting him something. If I hadn't spoken to Mrs. Horne about work, you wouldn't have anything for him. You don't love him."

"Don't you say that. Don't you dare say that." Gloria sprang to her feet.

"Why—why—I love Papa more than...."

"Actions speak louder than words," Marie reminded virtuously. "He spends practically all his money on pencils and drawing pads for you, and you don't want to work one afternoon for him."

Gloria started to deny that, but stopped short. It was no use. She could never make her sister understand, for no words could tell how she felt about Papa.

"Let's go." Levi had a half-day leave from the harvesting, and he

THE GIFT

The horse's head was down, and only the occasional twitching of his tail revealed that there was life in his body. Slowly Gloria went for her bonnet, and more slowly followed her sister to the gate. She wanted to go to town, too. Levi picked up the reins as Marie climbed into the buggy and sat beside him. Gloria watched, but she could not see too well. Her brother clucked to the horse and Marie turned for a last word of warning.

"Be sure and wash all her dishes, and don't undress the baby."

Their laughter floated back. Undressing the baby was the valley's standing joke. Gloria stood motionless in the dusty road while the sound of the rattling wheels died away and the gathering silence from the fields enveloped her, but no silence was thick enough to smother the sound of that laughter or kind enough to ease the pain in her heart.

Why did people always laugh at her? No one laughed at Levi or Marie. Undressing the Wilson baby hadn't been a laughing matter at first. The only trouble was that Mrs. Wilson had come home too soon, and she had made a scandal of it.

"Gloria, why did you undress Buster?"

Mama had demanded. Mrs. Wilson had been standing back of her and that had sharpened Mama's voice.

"His clothes were ugly."

It hadn't taken that story long to go the rounds, but along with the laughter had gone quick glances and much head shaking. Papa and Mr. Wilson had laughed, too, but not that way. Theirs had been a secret fun chuckle; and for Christmas, Mr. Wilson had given her a box of precious paints. He'd had the store man send all the way to San Francisco for them.

For that box she would listen to a million laughs. The girl walked slowly, reveling in the feel of brown dust between her bare toes. She followed a winding road up a low hill, and at the top stopped to look over the wonder of the canvas spread for her inspection. The blue mountains, the rolling hills, the weather-stained buildings she could see and those she could not see offered peace, and at once the hurt was gone.

On the south slope her father was riding the binder, and the falling bundles left a golden trail behind him. As she watched he stopped the team while he stacked the bundles. Helping him would be more fun than washing dishes or tending a baby. Resolutely she put one foot ahead of the other. She must go to the Hornes'. She tried to count the heat waves that shimmered across the hills, but she couldn't, and that was queer. She couldn't draw them either, but they were there and she could see them plain as day.

Phew! It was hot. Quickly, without the pain of deciding, she turned from the road and went down a swale where a grove of quaking aspens marked a patch of grass and shade. Lying on her back, she watched a lazy wind shoo popcorn clouds above the quivering aspen leaves. In the high blue a hawk hung motionless. It was all so beautiful something inside her chest kept swelling and swelling, and she was going to burst if she didn't get her pencils and drawing pad.

She knew where Marie had hidden them—on the top shelf of the kitchen safe behind Mama's best plates. In some ways Marie was awfully dumb. Wouldn't she be surprised if she came home and found the pencils gone? Gloria could go back for them, if she wanted. She had been four days without them, and tomorrow was a long time away.

She half rose, and then lay back. Marie was right; she did spend too much time with her pencils. Why couldn't she be like Marie? Why couldn't she be like anyone but herself?

Course, she was like Papa—some. People laughed at him, too, because he didn't have big barns or good machinery, and because he used words they did not know.

Like pec'cy. When she had asked him what it meant, he had held her close to him for a moment.

"Peccancy? When did you hear me use it? It could mean a cancer of disintegration, a too-keen sensibility to innuendoes and thinly veiled smiles. It could mean being hurt instead of facing facts."

Gloria did not understand all the words but she knew exactly what he meant, and she could always tell when the pain was with him.

Sometimes when he came in from the fields or from town she could see it on his face, and then she got all tight inside just as she did when Mr. Wilson gave her the paints. How could Marie think she didn't love him? She couldn't explain her love for him; she could only feel it, and Marie could not know feel without words.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948

She would do anything for him, anything. She would even give up drawing if he asked, but he wouldn't ask. She sighed and, as if in answer, the quaking aspen bent low, its leaves rustling, just asking to be painted.

She must have a pencil. She was going home right now and get one. No—no, she would prove to Marie that she did love Papa. Mrs. Hornes' would give her twenty cents for the afternoon. What could she buy for twenty cents? Work socks were two pairs for twenty-five cents. Work socks! She wouldn't be guilty.

What could she—oh, no, could anything be more exciting than the way the leaves of that one branch twinkled and danced? One moment they were points of light and the next they were blobs of shadow. If only she could find something as beautiful to give Papa. A horse would be beautiful, and a horse was exactly what he needed.

He didn't have a riding horse like the other dry-farmers. If she could give him one. Strangers had a three-year-old roan that was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen, except Starlight.

GHE sat up suddenly. If Papa could ride into town on him! Starlight was a wild stallion, a Palomino, that roamed these hills and coaxed the mares away from the farmers. They all hated him, and everyone had had a try at catching him. All but Papa. He would never help when a try was made.

Course, he didn't have a horse that could keep in sight of the stallion, but she knew he would not try if he did have a horse. Once she had gone to the field to tell him something and had found THE GIFT him on Bald Knob, watching. She had looked, and there, feeding across the valley, was Starlight and—his mares.

The look on Papa's face had been exactly like the feeling that came with painting. If only she could catch Starlight; but what was the use of wishing. She bet she could lead him if she could get her hands in his mane, but he would never let her get that close; and Strangers would never sell the roan for twenty cents.

They probably wouldn't even take the twenty cents as a down payment. She would have to think of something else. Likely, she couldn't find another brush. Gloria squirmed as she thought of that present. They were still throwing it up to her—bringing home a sagebrush for a bouquet. She had been down by the river visiting an Indian camp. Her friend, Pete Jim, was walking home with her when they discovered the limb. It was bent and twisted. Back on itself in a way that had immediately reminded her of Papa's brass bowl. The olive-gray leaves, the stringy bark of the sage, and the old country bowl had been made for each other. She and Pete had tugged and twisted and pulled until the limb broke from the main brush. She had carried it very carefully. Once home, Mama had ordered her to throw it away.

"I have to burn the dirty stuff," so please don't give me a bouquet of it."

"But it is beautiful." They had laughed, as always, but Papa had caught Marie's arm when she would have thrown it out. He had handled it carefully, almost lovingly.

"It is beautiful, Glory, and don't let anyone tell you differently—now or ever." 227

With a start Gloria brought her mind back. "There must be a rancher among these hills who would sell a horse on time; but she still lacked the twenty cents, and it was a cinch no one would let her have a horse without something down. It would almost be easier to catch Starlight." She rose slowly to her feet and looked at the winding road. Why didn't it go to the river? "That was an idea. She might trade for an Indian pony, but first she would have to find the camp, for it had been moved last week. Oh dear!" Anyway, she would not buy work socks.

LORIA started over the hill, picking her way carefully lest she step on a prickly pear or a sharp stone. A quarter of a mile farther on she came to the road again. Over the brow of the next hill she could see the top of a windmill that marked the Horne ranch. Mrs. Horne would say she was late again and why wasn't she like Marie.

Suddenly a horse came galloping around a turn in the road, followed by a paint pony—Angus Johnson and Pete Jim.

"Strangers have corralled Starlight," Angus yelled as he passed. "Starlight!" Pete echoed, lashing his pony from side to side. Gloria froze. Dust swirled about her face and she did not know it. What had Angus said? Strangers had corralled Starlight. Strangers had...

With a sudden leap, she sped down the road toward home.

"Strangers have corralled Starlight."

Throwing open the kitchen door, she reached into the cupboard for her pencils and pad. Even by cutting over the hills, it was four miles to the Stanger ranch. 228

Gloria's face was red and streaked with dust as she came panting into the yard where the stallion was being held. Men of every age, ranchers and dry-farmers, even a few from town, were crowding about and onto a high pole fence.

"Get back," a man spoke rudely as the girl tried to force a way to the top pole. "Get gone. This is no place for girls."

"That animal is a killer." "Leave me alone!"

That animal is a killer. "Come on, wildcat. Beat it. Go home to your mother."

The man laid his hands on her and would have lifted her to the ground, but just then a hoarse shout went up from the crowd.

The man turned hurriedly lest he miss something. Gloria sat on the top and nudged her toes between two lower poles. She drew a deep breath.

There he was. There he was, her Starlight. Never in all the world had there been another like him. He was—unbelievable. Her fingers moved. Surely, smoothly over the paper. Indifferent as to how the stallion had been corralled, indifferent to the sweating, swearing men; only vaguely conscious that men, horseback and on foot, were venturing into the corral and dashing out again; through all the dust and confusion Gloria's attention was on her never-quiet model.

Once the stallion plunged straight toward her and the fence emptied like magic. When the men climbed back Pete Jim was on one side of her and his father on the other. Then, for one priceless moment, Starlight stood in the center of the corral, his tail high, mane blowing, eyes dilated with terror and challenge.

Don't move, oh, don't move!

Line by line, stroke by stroke, the horse grew on the paper; a horse so perfect in form and arrested movement the Indians lost interest in the live animal. Five minutes more...

"He's wearing down!"

"Watch out, everybody!"

"Now is the time to get him!"

"Jim Stanger is going in on his roan!"

GLORIA sensed the tension at the gate. She saw Starlight gather his muscles for the try; she saw him leap; she knew he had scattered the men at the gate and was gone.

A roar of disappointment went up from the crowd. Men flung themselves on their horses and gave chase. The yard was suddenly empty.

Gloria sat motionless, except for her arm and hand. She must catch those last lines before the picture faded from her mind. When at last she had finished and, with a tired sigh, raised her eyes, she was alone on the fence except for Pete and his father.

The older Indian, a braid hanging over each shoulder, pushed back his hat and black eyes looked into blue ones.

"Good," he said shortly, and the girl's tired, reddened face brightened. "We are camped down by the Narrows," Pete told her, as he slid from the fence to follow his father.

The four miles home were endless. Gradually the fever of creation left the girl, and what she had to face at home loomed unendurable. They would not laugh this time. They would have tight mouths and hard eyes. Papa might.... Oh, Papa, Papa.

His birthday was nearly over, and she had nothing for him. (Continued on page 283)

"See Dhan At Mt CENERAL PRESIDENCY "CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT"

One of these certificates bearing the signatures of the general presidency of Relief Society is being sent to stakes and wards, missions and branches as 100% quotas from them are received.

The certificates have been made the size of the ward and stake record books so that they may be punched and kept in the record book if desired.

A WORD OF CAUTION

We call attention to a paragraph contained in the "Financial Plan for the Relief Society Building" dated October 21, 1947.

A copy of this plan was sent to each Relief Society stake president and sufficient additional copies were enclosed so that each ward Relief Society president could be given one. The general board is not unmindful of the fact that the circumstances of some sisters are not such that they can contribute the full amount of the individual quota. For that reason we are publishing the following excerpt from the "Financial Plan" as set forth in October 1947: "This plan is predicated upon our wish, our hope, and our prayer that the money for this new Relief Society building shall be collected, in large part, by the Relief Societies throughout the Church; that every member RELIEF SOCIETY BUILDING NEWS 231 shall participate toward its erection. We want this to be a building for and by Relief Society women. 'To this end, a quota of $5 for each enrolled member has been set as the goal necessary to achieve this objective. However, the general board realizes that there are some members who may not be in a position to make so large a contribution, and it is not intended that any woman shall be burdened beyond her means and, particularly, we are anxious that no member shall be embarrassed if she is not prepared to contribute as much as the assigned quota. Nevertheless, we should like some contribution from each member, be it ever so small."

HONEYVILLE (UTAH), BEEHIVE GIRLS CONTRIBUTE TO RELIEF SOCIETY BUILDING FUND

Seated, left to right: Carol Hunsaker and Leota Hunsaker.
Standing: Nora Harper; Rea Nielsen; Diane Burke.

Sister Lois G. Hunsaker, North Box Elder Stake Bee Keeper, has submitted the following interesting letter regarding this active group:
"Our Relief Society president told me she thought I ought to send you this picture of my five bee hive girls. They have all contributed one dollar to the new Relief Society home to be built in Salt Lake City. They not only helped the building fund, but also benefited themselves by filling cell No. 7 in the field of public service for gatherers. The picture was taken last summer in the Salt Lake City Rose Gardens when the group went to see 'The Promised Valley.' They are a very conscientious and active group of bee hive girls, having filled all their requirements and they are preparing to graduate next year as honor bee hive girls."

New Promise Christie Lund Coles Now all the lean, dark corridors of earth
Are shimmering with green of emerald leaves.
And there is beauty in the spring's rebirth
That every flower generously receives.
The sound of growth is audible, almost.
In swiftly swelling bud, in sap of tree.
The petaled branches, in a bouffant host,
Are lyrics of poetic majesty.

Here is returning beauty on the land.

Here is the earth's long hope made manifest; here our prosaic reasoning must stand awed by this miracle the heart has guessed. Here is the promise of a future yield—  
In lifted spirit, as in fertile field.

Questing Lights

Belle Watson Anderson

CHAPTER 1

At last came the click of the old hedge gate, the familiar creak of its rusty hinges, and Jane knew her waiting was at an end.
Andrew Ramsay, her fiancé, was not one minute late, yet it had seemed to her that she had waited forever for his coming tonight. She opened the front door and saw him leaning against the luxuriant hedge that grew in front of the Allison home.

The moon was resplendent, silvering the beautiful village of King's Kettle.
Andrew called excitedly to Jane, "What a wonderful picture to carry with me to America!"
"Oh, Andrew, are you sure that you know what you are doing? Somehow I just can't feel the same way about it all that you do. So many things can happen over which we have no control—sickness, accidents, and even death."

Andrew turned anxiously to Jane. Her worry and fear were astounding to him.
She went on, "Perhaps I'm disappointing you when I tell you that I honestly wish things were just as they were before you joined the Church and made up your mind to go to Utah." Her face became serious—far too serious.

They stood silent for a moment, watching the moon sail in and out among the white clouds, like a silver shuttle weaving its way across the heavens.
"Scotland is a sweet country," she began speaking again, "good enough for any man's country. I have heard you say so many times yourself, and yet you are leaving it all."
Andrew turned and studied Jane for a few moments, the childhood sweetheart he had loved for so many years.
"Jane, I am sure you do not want me to stay on in Scotland, when the new world offers all the things I want from life—religion, security, a home of my own. I can never have those things here. Can't you understand, dear?"
"But Scotland would give you to me, Andrew," she answered wistfully. "That is all that matters, my darling."
"The new country will unite us, Jane." Andrew was trying hard to explain. "It won't be long before I can send for you, and then we will always be together in our new home."

Jane sighed a long, deep sigh.
Andrew turned and spoke tenderly. "Don't, Jane. No man is worthy of such devotion, but if a man can be, I am going to be that man."
Reassured, Jane looked up and smiled, sunshine bursting through a drift of clouds. She believed him. She had proved him so many times before.

"Come with me to tell your parents goodbye, before we attend the farewell party. I must get home early tonight to spend some time with mother, and I'll need to rise early if I get the coach in Dumferline tomorrow."
236

A large crowd of friends, neighbors, and relatives were at the Rumgay home the next morning to wish Andrew good luck on his journey. Andrew was busy. He had borrowed a wheelbarrow from the foreman of the mine, where he had been working as cage-hoister. He was packing all of his clothing and books into a large brown kist that had belonged to his father. This was to be placed into the barrow, with his other belongings, and pushed to Dumfriesshire. Andrew loved books. Since he began working, every two pence that could be spared from his pay envelope had gone for the purchase of books. Jane had made several fruitcakes and some shortbread, and was waiting her chance to slip them into the kist unnoticed. Each member of the family came with a gift, something Andrew could use on the way, although it perhaps had cost only a halfpenny. His mother's gift was precious and a complete surprise to her boy. She had taken the fleece of a sheep, washed and carded the wool, and then spun the wool into soft yarn. With this she had knit him under-wear, a sweater, a tam, gloves, and a muffler. Andrew was deeply touched. He thought of Joseph's coat of many colors and knew now just how Joseph must have appreciated it. Taking his mother in his arms, he said, "Such a mother! And these hands! No others are as beautiful. I remember the day, almost the very hour, that every wrinkle was worn and beaten into them. Someday I hope to soften and adorn them, dear." He kissed them tenderly.

"It isn't easy to leave my loved ones, but while I'm away the weeans will work just a little harder, and be just a little kinder because I'm not here."
"I am sure they will," answered Mrs. Rumgay, drying the fast-falling tears on the hem of her apron.
"Don't fret about us, Andrew. We will get along grand while we are apart."

Andrew patted her stooped shoulders, lovingly looked at her, then turned back to his work.

Janet Rumgay was quite through with emotional demonstrations. She had patiently endured so many sorrows and hard trials since her husband had died. And there was no other way. Andrew had gone over it with her many times, had fasted and prayed about it, and always received the same answer. He did not wish to be selfish, but it was the one way out for them all. They would soon be together in a new land of opportunity.

Andrew was packed and ready. Jane could see something must be done about the next few minutes. She spoke to Mary, and then pushed the wheelbarrow in through the front door.
"Your coach is waiting, Sir. Now, we will bring in the horses."
Mary, Andrew's sister, walked around and stood by one of the handles. Jane took her place by the other. Andrew's uncles placed his luggage into the barrow while he began bidding all his loved ones goodbye.

"Now Pete and Bally, get up," Jane shouted.
The girls picked up the barrow, pushed it down the stone walk, through the gate, and into the long, QUESTING LIGHTS country lane that would lead them onto the highway to Dumfriesshire. Trying to remember all the loving admonitions and messages he had just heard, Andrew went running down the lane calling to the girls to wait for him.
When he did catch up with them they refused to turn the barrow over to him. They walked the old road together, the road where they had spent so many happy childhood hours and, since they grew older, had often strolled together on moonlit nights, passing to and from church at Dumfriesshire.

Young Rumgay was quite the Beau Brummel this morning, walking along fully a head taller than his companions. Jane and Mary could not keep their eyes away from him, he was so brave in his new black suit, white shirt, and black tie. He wore his mother's gift—the tam. The girls were breaking a tradition in wearing their Sunday clothes today.

Andrew had noticed it and appreciated the honor. Maybe his going away really meant a great deal to them. Mary looked up at Andrew and gave a quick roguish giggle. "When I am old and gray and have my grandchildren sitting around me, I shall tell them about today." Looking over at her brother, she added, "I shall tell them that when I was seventeen I walked to Dumferline with their Uncle Andrew, who is now a millionaire in America, and I wore my Sunday clothes. I can see them now, the darlings, inconceivably shocked, and...." "Hold on there, Mary," Andrew put in, "tell them I am a faithful Latter-day Saint instead of a millionaire. 237 You've missed the purpose of my going away, my dear." "As you wish, my brother, but they shall be shocked." Fourteen miles walking and pushing a wheelbarrow is a trying experience, but no complaints were registered, for parting was at the end of the road. Jane was fine in her new Paisley cashmere, a clear tan background, colored with every delicate tint of spring. Mary's dress was a winecolored alpaca, with fitted basque, circular skirt, and creamy lace collar and cuffs. Both girls wore poke bonnets with ribbon ties. Jane's golden curls were forcing their way out of every curve and ripple of her bonnet.

* * *

Al Dumferline, they were met at the station by a young elder, Hugh Shand, who had been doing home missionary work with Andrew for two years. Now they were emigrating together. Andrew and Jane, with only a little time remaining, left the party and walked down one of the city's most beautiful flagged streets, to an old monastery. "Scotland's Westminster," drew quietly remarked. "Yes," returned Jane, "so many of the great people of Scotland lie buried here, among them Saint Margaret and Malcolm Canmore. Faithful in life—faithful in death." "These old walls could tell the real romances of Scotland, if they could only speak," Andrew responded. "They were always true and loyal to each other," Jane added. "That seems to be a virtue of the Scotch." She turned to Andrew wistfully. 238 "We will be just as true, won't we?" "We will'? Andrew assured her, taking her arm. Jane led Andrew to a stone bench near the old, time-worn wall. "I must tell you of a dream I had last night. Oh, I know you do not believe in dreams, and do not want to hear me tell them, but this one has kept me worried all day. I dreamed that you and I were in a deep fog, and we could not find one another. I could hear you calling me, and I think you could hear me calling you, but you were always beyond me. I never found you." "The dream was caused by your worry at my going away. Soon, when I have gone, you will get over fretting and the fog will clear away." He looked at his watch. It was time they were getting back to the station. Taking Jane's hand, he began running and pulling her after him. They were children again, as they had been in old King's Kettle lane, they reached the station, the coach came to a stop. Andrew caught Jane in his arms and whispered, "The dearest and most precious sweetheart that a man ever loved, and you will be mine through all eternity." He kissed her tenderly, and jumped on the moving coach. Andrew slumped into the first seat he reached. Hugh joined him. Neither spoke. Andrew had known it would be hard to part from Jane, but how hard he had never guessed. He turned and looked out of the window, watched one field and another mile pass by like a dream in a strange panorama. He studied the people about him, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948 strained, work-hardened faces, men, women, and children crowded into the cheap compartment. He spoke to Hugh, "We little know what lies before us, but all the joy and sweetness of life have been worked out of these good people, the best that live on the earth." After awhile Hugh spoke, "Say, fellow, come out of it and listen to what I have to say." He shook Andrew and began laughing at the mood they found themselves in. "Say, let's forget it. Father was telling me last night of another Andrew who left Dumferline, sometime ago." "Who was it?" Andrew began showing some interest. "Did he belong to the Church?" "No. His name was Andrew Carnegie. He left and went to America to make money. He was doing all right here, but he could make it faster over there. Lots of men make fortunes over there." Both boys became silent for a time. Andrew spoke first. "My fortune, I hope, will be in spiritual values. I shall be content to live with the people of God, own my own home, and have enough to make my loved ones secure." "That's the way I feel, Rumgay." "It will be wonderful to be with those who love the things that I love, whose ideals and principles are those I have learned are true. They will by my people and my fortune." They traveled mile after mile, station after station, city after city, until they came to Liverpool. "Change cars for America," Hugh shouted, picking up his suitcase. "Yes," returned Andrew with enthusiasm, "Zion, we are coming!" (To be continued)

A New Stove for Mother Norma Wrathall that balmy autumn day, October first, mother's birthday, things might have been different if the Center City bus had arrived a little later than schedule, or if Harry had phoned earlier than he did. It was nearly noon, and we three girls had been at mother's old home since five that morning. Kate, the eldest of us, always laughs when I say girls, for we're all on the best side of forty. Kate and I were working like fury, putting the finishing touches on mother's apartment before her arrival on the bus, and Em was polishing the stove. "T must say," she grumbled, pushing her damp gray hair back with one smudged hand, "these old-fashioned stoves might be wonderful to cook on, such a big top, and all, and maybe mother never would get used to a modern one; but they're miserable things to clean." "It was your own idea, Em, you know it was," retorted Kate. "Dot and I wanted to get her a new white enameled range, but you said...." "Mother will be pleased as punch," I interrupted quickly. "You know what store she has always set by her old things. It's lucky she didn't sell anything when she went to Center City to live with Aunt Celia, even though it looked, at the time, as if the arrangement might be permanent." "It was a funny thing, though," Kate mused, "Mother kept all her other things—warned us to store everything, not sell a thing—but she Page 240 gave her stove to that man who used to go around fixing lawn mowers.

He had a wife and seven children, and he told Mother, that fall when she moved, that he didn't have a stove good enough to last the winter. So Mother gave him her old Kitchen Queen; didn't even ask him to do any work in return for it." "Yes, it's the only improvident thing I've ever known Mother to do," said Em, "but she may have regretted it. I remember, she said to me, at the time, 'Sometimes, when I think of giving my stove to that poor man, I feel almost guilty.'" "That's what I think," I agreed. '"Mother's good heart got the best of her judgment. Later, when she thought of how she'd had the stove ever since she was married, she felt sort of sentimental about having given it away." 

AS I placed the ornaments on the whatnot which Pa had carved from native wood so many years ago, I was thinking of how nice it was that Mother could come back here to live. She had moved out to Center City to live with her sister Celia, soon after Harry left to join the navy. He was one of the first to go, two years before the war actually started, so it had been several years since he left. Mother had felt that she couldn't keep up the big place, and Aunt Celia being alone at the time, they had decided to combine households.

Harry is the son of our only brother, who was killed in World War I. His young wife at that time was living here at the old home with Mother, but a few months after the baby was born, she skipped off with another man, leaving the infant Harry with a note pinned to him, leaving him for Mother to care for. Mother already had a load of sorrow, for Pa had died suddenly a few years back, so I guess Harry filled a need in her life. As he grew up, there was always a strong bond of affection between them. But she was strict with him.

Why, I remember how, when he was just a little tad, he used to carry water, and coal, and wood. Mother rented out the farm, but even so her income was small, so she saved and made over everything she could. That may have been one reason she took such good care of her furniture. In later years, she was offered a good price for some pieces, such as her spool bed, the old-fashioned highboy, and the grandfather's clock, but she wouldn't part with any of them.

When Harry came back from World War II, he said at once that he was going to take his G. I. Money and the savings he had, and fix up the old home for Mother. He said he knew she wasn't really happy living in someone else's house. So he had the rambling old house remodeled into a duplex, with new plumbing and a furnace. Mother was to have one apartment, and rent the other. Harry would stay there with her, and go back and forth to his work in an electrical supply factory.

Thus it was that on her birthday, she was to come home. We had planned a little party for her, open 241 house for her friends during the afternoon. Since Em's house is the closest to Mother's, we had the lunch ready there, to bring over at the last minute. We had planned the whole thing about two weeks earlier, while we were at Em's place one afternoon, helping her tie a quilt.

KK FE were trying to think what to get for Mother's birthday present. Harry had already spent so much that we felt we should get something special. Kate was saying that about the only thing Mother lacked was a cook stove. If the three of us went in together, it wouldn't be too expensive. "But how would a new white-enameled range look in here with all these fine old pieces?" demanded Em. "Besides, I think Mother would never want to cook on anything but a Kitchen Queen range. You both know how she took such pride in it, polishing it every morning, no matter what. Remember how she used to tell us, 'the stove and the floor, girls; that's what people notice first.'" 

Kate was a little doubtful. "Mother took pride in keeping everything clean, as far as that goes. And I don't know...." But Em and I won her over. To us, our happiest childhood memories were blended with the great black range, the firelight glowing around the rims of the lids on winter evenings, the warmth from the open oven door on shivery mornings. I can remember coming home from school, stiff with cold, and warming my spread-out fingers over the range.

As we sat there talking, Harry came breezing in. Even as a little boy he'd had an irritating habit of barging in, just when you were talking about something. But if you said a word, he'd cock one eyebrow, and stay right there. "Hi, Aunts," he said, helping himself to one of Em's oatmeal cookies, "what's the big discussion?" I explained carefully that we were planning a little surprise for Mother's birthday. But I wouldn't tell him what it was.

"Think you should let me help with it," he insisted. "After all, she's been Mother, Father, and Gramma, all rolled into one, to me. And besides, I know just what she wants." Kate said patiently, "Not this time, Harry. You've done enough already. And perhaps we understand old people a little better than you do. You could just get her some flowers, or something."

Harry kept right on insisting, until he'd finished all the cookies. He said he certainly understood old people, especially Gramma. What about that time he took her over to Center City to a show, and bought her a new hat for Christmas, when we'd suggested house slippers? But we were firm with him, and he left, not knowing what we intended to get.

AS it turned out, maybe we should have taken him into our confidence. It was the night before Mother's birthday before we could get the range installed, because Em had such a time finding one; it seemed the company had stopped making them some time before the war. Em's husband, Jim, and a neighbor, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�APRIL 1948 put the stove up. Harry had gone out of town on business for his firm for a day or two, which made it all the easier to keep the secret.

But by the morning of October first, he still hadn't come back, and we hoped he hadn't been delayed. Mother would be terribly disappointed if he wasn't home to welcome her. Em put the can of Shining Sun stove polish on the warming oven—it was the kind Mother had always used—and gave a few extra touches to the nickel trimming on the stove. She was standing on newspapers, because I had waxed the linoleum.

Well, what do you think of it?" _ She stepped back to admire her work, Kate put the blue willow-ware pitcher up into the cupboard, and climbed down from her chair before answering. "Well, it's in good shape," she said, after a moment. "But it's so black looking." "Black, of course it's black," I said hastily. Em was warm and tired. "But oh, doesn't it remind you of school mornings, when Mother would stand there, frying hot cakes for us? And that blue pitcher full of syrup on the warming oven—so the syrup would pour easily." I could almost see Mother, her tall, spare figure bent over the griddle, a clean, faded apron tied around her waist. "I can just about taste those hot cakes—melted butter on them, too," sighed Kate. "And can either of you, for all your electric ranges, bake bread like Mother's?" "No," admitted Em. "And I have never been able to bake a decent batch of popovers. As soon as A NEW STOVE FOR MOTHER Mother gets settled, I'm coming over and hint strongly for popovers." Kate said, "How that stove takes me back! Don't you remember, when we were little, and the threshers were there for dinner? My, those were the meals! Meat and potatoes and vegetables, and two desserts." "Yes, and popping corn on winter evenings," said Em. She was at the sink washing her hands. I began gathering the newspapers from the floor. It was nearly bus time. I wish Harry would come," said Kate. Do you think we should have told him about the stove?" "No need to; surely we could do this much ourselves," I answered. Yes then, the phone rang, and Em went into the hall to answer it. I heard her saying, "But Harry! Why didn't you tell us? Oh, dear, goodness knows what we'll do now...!" Before I could ask her what was the matter, Kate had run to the front door. "It's Mother—the bus is here!" she cried, and the next instant we were all at the door. Mother stood there smiling, looking so nice in the new print dress she'd made herself, and wearing her little straw hat. She never would wear her felt hat until winter had set in. She exclaimed over everything as we led her through the rooms. "Oh, it's all so nice, real nice," she kept saying. "But where is Harry?" "Oh, he'll be along," said Em, vaguely. "He phoned, and...." She didn't finish the sentence. Kate had tied a handkerchief over Mother's eyes, and was leading her into the kitchen. "This is the best surprise of all," she said. 243 We stood around smiling, as Kate removed the blindfold. Mother didn't notice the stove at first, because her back was toward it. Her cheeks were pink with pleasure, and her eyes misted as she saw the crisp red-and-white dotted swiss curtains at the sparkling windows, the familiar ornaments on her own corner shelves, the dishes, shining through the glass doors of the cupboard. There was a bowl of chrysanthemums on the table, and her own round, rag rugs on the floor. It looked so comfortable and homey, you could almost smell the homemade bread baking. Then Mother turned around and saw the stove. I have seen Mother happy, and sad, and even angry, at times. But the look on her face was a mixture of all these, plus amazement. A dull red replaced the flush of pleasure in her cheeks. Tears came into her eyes. But I think we all knew that they were not tears of happiness. "Girls—is this my old stove?" she asked, at last. Em swallowed. "Why, no, Mother. It's a newer one, just like yours. I—that is, we thought...." Her voice seemed to fail. Em had an odd look on her face. Kate faltered, "We thought you'd like it, to remind you of old times...." I couldn't say a word. After a pause, Mother said, in a dull voice, "It does. Yes, it reminds me of old times. Times that managed somehow to be happy in spite of it." She cleared her throat. "It's funny, how something like that stove can take you back. All the years I stood over it in the heat, cooking and baking and putting up fruit, and the summers, when there were threshers and hay hands to cook for. And getting up early to take out the soot and ashes, after Pa died and wasn't here to help me. And blacking the old thing every morning of the world before the fire was made! There was a place in the grate where the fire would fall out, and the oven get cold if you didn't place the fuel just right." MOTHER made a little helpless gesture with her hands, and sat down in her rocking chair. "Then she said, gently, "There, now. I shouldn't have said that. But it took me so by surprise—I thought it was the same one, after I'd thought I was rid—that is, it's been so many years. My goodness, I know how hard you've all worked to make things nice for me. And you'll never, never, know how wonderful it is to be home again. Don't let anyone ever tell you there's a place on earth like home! I appreciate all you've done, and the money that's been spent—all my lovely old things, kept just like new." She gave a little laugh. "You girls will have to forgive me. I guess there's nothing like an old stove, to bring out the worst in a woman's nature." Her words echoed away into the silence. I tried to say that, of course, we could take the stove back. But I couldn't get the words past the lump in my throat. All at once, I knew just how she felt. To see that great black stove, and all that work starting over again. As Kate pointed out later, it's fine to revere the past, but you don't have to live in it. For once, it was a relief when Harry came bouncing in. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948 "Hi, everybody. Well, look who's here!" He leaned over, and gave Mother a resounding kiss. "Why are all of you so quiet? And why did you put that stove up in here? I thought we were going to put it on the back porch." He was standing near me, and kicked me, hard, on the ankle. Mother began, "Now, I've made a mistake...." "Never mind that," laughed Har- "Come out to the front porch, and see how you like your birthday present." "You mean there's something else? What is it, dear?" "Oh, just some flowers." winked at Kate. As we all trouped out, he stepped back, and hissed into my ear, "Lucky Jim told me in time. Maybe after this...." He had bought her some flowers, all right. A dozen long-stemmed American Beauty roses. And they were lying on top of a brand new electric range. Mother's face was radiant. "Oh, Harry—" she choked. "An electric stove! After all these years! Oh, you shouldn't have!" She covered her face with her hands. "Why, sure, Gramma. There, there, now.

You're not going to cry, are you? On your birthday?" He put his arm around her, and pulled a handkerchief from his pocket. Somehow, we three made our way back into the house. "We'd better go over to Em's and get the lunch," Harry muttered to Kate. As I followed Em out the back door, I saw she had something hidden under her apron. It was the can of black stove polish.

MORE THAN LOVE
Grace Sayre

Music is song on a silver night.
Sunlight over a brook's mossed stones,
Beads on the air in a slant of rain,
A meadow lark's liquid tones.
Music is petaled bloom adrift,
Fragrance of summer's mystic white.
Whispers of gladness, shadow of pain.
Clouds of the darkness, glories of light.
Music is more than love can spill
In overflowing of joy and song.
Music is more than the heart can hold.
And more than love, the whole day long.

UNTIL THEY RISE
LeRoy Burke Meagher

I shall weep when Easter comes,
Though Christ shall rise again.
In tabernacles of the hearts
Of all believing men.
I shall weep for doubting ones
Who long have sepulchered
Their faith in worldly deeds beyond
The hearing of his word.
I shall weep until all men's
Hosannas shall proclaim
They, too, have risen with the Christ
On Easter, in his name.

Sixty Years Ago
Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, April 1 and April 15, 1888

"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations"

EVERYDAY WORK
The sweetest lives are those to duty wed.
Whose deeds, both great and small,
Are close-knit strands of one unbroken thread,
Where love ennobles all.
The world may sound no trumpets, ring no bells.
The Book of Life the shining record tells.

SELECTED POI:
Plenty of poi and fish, or meat, a grass hut to shelter one from the storms, and the simplest of summer clothing—these are the Hawaiian's necessities. Here is a brief description of the kalo plant, from which poi is made. The leaves are very much like those of the calla lily. The root, which is the part eaten, grows to a size not exceeding six inches long, and three inches through. The kalo cannot be raised, pulled and garnered for future use as are most of our temperate vegetables, but has to be used within a month after it is ripe; and after having been gathered, if not cooked immediately, dries and is spoiled.

HOMESPUN
APRIL CONFERENCE: On Sunday afternoon, April 8, Apostle F. D. Richards presented the authorities of the Church to be voted for. Our late lamented sister, Eliza R. Snow Smith, has been president of the Relief Society ever since its organization in these mountains, and has labored with unexampled diligence for its welfare and advancement. Her death now leaves the organization without a president. Sister Zina D. Young was her first counselor. It is now moved and seconded that she be made president. Sister Young was chosen by unanimous vote.

THE OLD HOME
Sold! my home—and to a stranger; one who will never know how the heart clung to every stone and board and brick of that old crumbled house, how in its very ruins it was dearer than the palaces of kings. For the years could never tell them and they could never know, all the sunshine, all the gladness, all the sorrow, all the sadness that is woven in our lives in the old sweet precious home.
Oh, the memories! How they all come back again; my eyes are dim, my heart aches, the home is sold and to a stranger.

A.W.C. A WORD TO YOUNG MOTHERS:
Mothers, let me plead with you first to study the future welfare of your children, rather than the present gratification of all their little whims and appetites. If you know what is best for your child, as you, most of all, should do, insist upon obedience to your mature judgment, rather than humor his ignorance, when you know it will be injurious to him. Children are sure to meet with disappointments; they must learn self-denial sometime in their lives, and there is no easier, better time to begin to teach them this severe lesson, than when they are babes at your knee.

M.H.T.
WISDOM:
We should endeavor to purchase the good will of all men, and quarrel with no man needlessly, since any man's love may be useful, and every man's hatred is dangerous.
I. Barrow

MRS. AGNES OLSEN THOMAS, for nearly twenty-six years leader of the Salt Lake Stake Relief Society chorus, and member of the Tabernacle choir for more than fifty years, passed away January 9. She was almost ninety-one years of age. Her contributions to the musical culture of Utah were invaluable. Although she was the mother of nine children, she still found time to sing at countless funerals—without recompense, and was frequently contralto soloist with the Tabernacle choir. In her native Christiania, now Oslo, Norway, she sang (at a Latter-day Saints Church concert) "Solveig's Song" from the Peer Gynt suite by Grieg. This was the song's first public rendition. The choir leader was a member of the Christiania orchestra which was rehearsing Grieg's work. The director of the famous orchestra was in attendance and was very enthusiastic about Miss Olsen's voice.

TACKINANNY is a story by Mrs. Lizzie O. Borgeson White and granddaughter Dianne Olivia White about two little girl friends, one Indian and one white, and their common interest in the story of the Book of Mormon.
TO be published in the National Anthology of Patriotic Declamation, 1948, is Mrs. Bertha A. Kleinman's poem, "The Empire of the Free." Selected as one of the outstanding poems among 3,000 entries in the Thanksgiving contest of the National Poetry Foundation, it received a merit citation.

It has a fine, marching rhythm, and sonorous, ringing diction. Page 247 APRIL 1948 NO. 4 The Annual General Church Conference AS the season approaches for calling together the greatest assemblage held on earth—a general conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—all members have cause to reflect upon the deep significance of the occasion and the great responsibility resting upon the leaders of the Church and upon this people. It is a time appointed for the gathering in of the saints from near and far, to learn the will of the Lord from the lips of his chosen servants during these last days of prophetic import. To one but recently arrived from a distant land, attendance at a great general conference in the Tabernacle is a never-to-be-forgotten experience. Instead of meeting with a mere handful of saints, often under stringent circumstances, he now finds himself crowded into a magnificent and unique edifice made hallowed by the faithfulness and sacrifices of its pioneer builders and the stalwart saints who have succeeded them. He sees those living prophets, seers, and revelators, previously revered names, seated in majesty behind the rising tiers of pulpits. He notices the great center of the building filled with members of the priesthood, leaders in the stakes and missions of the Church.

Even to a regular attendant it is a sight which never fails to thrill and inspire, and as the anthems of Praise to the Lord rise ever higher, accompanied by the deep and mighty tones of the organ, the beholder seems to become a part of heaven on earth. All saints who are privileged to attend a general Church conference should come with broken hearts and contrite spirits, offering themselves as receptive vessels into which may be freely poured 'the blessings, exhortations, injunctions, and commandments pronounced by the living prophets. While this Church has a promise that the gospel will never be given to another people, the tempo at which the will of the Lord may be done on the earth depends, in great measure, upon the faithfulness and obedience of the members of the Church who must prove themselves worthy—instruments in the hands of the Lord that he may speedily accomplish his purposes. Let each saint, then, live by the Master's words, "Not my will but thine be done," and whether or not he can attend a general Church conference in person, let him in reality be a participant through reading, studying, and obeying the words of the prophets as enunciated therein.

Be done on earth as it is in heaven," Then will the passing of each general conference mark an increase in the righteousness of the saints. Then can they truly pay "they will be done on earth as it is in heaven," and look forward with eager expectancy to the fulfillment of this prayer on earth. M. C. S.

Notes to the Field: Change in Regulations or Membership in the Mormon Handicraft Gift Shop. A change in the regulations for memberships in the Mormon Handicraft Gift Shop was adopted by the general board of Relief Society on December 3, 1947, whereby stake and ward memberships will be confined to stake and ward organizations submitting merchandise for sale for the benefit of their own organizations. This new regulation will take effect on expiration of the present memberships. Members of Relief Society, as individuals, will no longer be able to submit articles under the stake and ward memberships but will be required to pay an individual membership fee of $1 annually. To simplify the payment of individual fees, the $1 will be deducted from the first sale of merchandise submitted by the prospective member. This will eliminate the necessity of paying membership fees in advance.

My Latest Inspiration Nan S. Richardson Sometime ago, about eighty-six years, I came to this world of joy and tears. I'm thankful for parents who Came with the band And established a home in this glorious land: I'm thankful for music, for books and flowers To enlighten one's mind and while away hours. I'm thankful for faith, and the gospel, and health That's been more to me than all the world's wealth. I'm thankful for sons and grandchildren, too, And brothers and sisters, and friends so true. But I don't like arthritis; I would be very pleased If I could buy hinges that would limber my knees.

Page 250 Bright April Margery S. Stewart Visiting teaching for the month would be done. Nora Linden took a deep breath of the sunsplashed autumn air and turned into the walk that led to the very small duplex at the end of the street. She stepped over red toy trucks and scattered blue doll dishes, climbed the steps, and rang the bell. In the glass that decorated the door she could see her face. She noted, with a wry dismay, the lines that ran upward from her eyes and the powdering of gray in her bright, brown hair. She could hear a baby crying inside, and suddenly an older child wailed sharply. Not a propitious moment for a call. But her finger found the bell again. The door was opened by a girl, she was not more than that, who held the knob with one hand, while a wailing baby on her other arm kicked and a little boy of two clutched at her knees and roared in angry grief.

Somewhere beyond the wildly disordered room, a voice shrieked for "Mommy!" "I'm Nora Linden." She held out her arms. "Let me hold the baby, then you can tend to him." The girl laid the baby in Nora's arms and knelt beside the boy. She lifted his hand, covered a bruised forefinger with kisses. "There, darling, there. It will be all tight. See it's all better." Nora saw that the girl's hands were shaking. "Smile, Bobby." "It's broke," he said. Ice one more house and her.

She rose. "Thank you. My name is Ann Bentley." Nora looked at the girl's long, dark hair, at her drawn but still lovely pointed face, her amazingly beautiful eyes, blue and tilted at the corners, at her slim rough hands. "You were Ann Phillips, weren't you?" "Yes." "I went to school with your mother. I remember you, especially when you drove around in that bright red convertible... Most beautiful girl in town." "Most beautiful girl in town?" The girl's smile was a distorted twist of her lovely mouth. "Sounds like someone I met... Not me." Tears crowded hot and thick down her white cheeks. "Ann Phillips, the little girl with the large dreams."

"ANN?" Nora looked helplessly at the girl. "I'm sorry. It's been... A rugged day." She hid her face in the baby's blanket, her young shoulders rocked.

Nora led her to a chair, brushed blocks from it, and eased the girl down. She lifted the baby higher on her shoulder. "I know just what it's like. I've cried many and many a time."

"We have three children," she said, "and we can't take care of them. Three, and our lives are a rotten, quarreling mess." "I know it's a struggle," Nora said.

"Struggle!" She lifted her face to Nora. "I can't struggle any more. I'm going to get a divorce."

"No," Nora said. "Please..."

"Yes," the girl cried. "Yes and yes and yes! I'm not going to stay home, fight dirt, meals, never on top of any of them, while Ted rides high, having fun, afraid to soil his hands. I won't take it any more."

For the first time, Nora permitted herself a look around the room. It might be a pretty room under the dust and the litter of magazines and the chair filled with unironed clothes.

"Isn't it a mess? Dotty, my little girl, has been sick for two days, besides I just can't seem to get things organized. I didn't know how to boil water when we were married, and..." faint laughter touched the words, "I'm still burning it."

She sat up. "I'm all right now. I'm sorry I bothered you with my troubles." But Nora saw the strain it was for the pale mouth not to tremble, the hands to knot tightly so they could not shake. Exhaustion.

How well Nora knew the signs. "Took," she said, "knowing your mother makes me practically an aunt, and you know how aunts are always interfering. First... How long since you've been to town?"

"Three weeks." "Good gracious! Well, you pop into the tub and get dressed. Make an appointment to get your hair done tomorrow, make a date for lunch, and right now you'll just have time to meet this Ted of yours for dinner and a show. I'll baby tend."

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948

"But Dotty?" "What is it?" "A cold." "Tish!" Nora sniffed. "Colds run when they see me coming." "But your own family?" Ann was wavering.

Expertly, Nora fished in the chair load of clothes for a diaper, carried it and the baby to the couch. She folded the dry cloth around the dimpled legs.

"We just live up the street. I'll call and tell them not to wait for me. There's a casserole dish in the oven." "I can really go?" Nora watched the delight kindle beauty in the young face. "Go, child, and don't worry about a thing."

When Ann had left, Nora made a quick survey of the house and went to work. She changed the linen in the baby's bed under the grave scrutiny of the four-year-old Dotty, who trotted after her in pink pajamas and fluffy blue slippers.

"You're handsome," Dotty said largely. "Grandmother is handsome too, but she's in California." "What's California?" Bobby wanted to know. He brought his red chair and thumped it down on the bedroom floor. "Let's talk about lions."

Laughter ran through Nora. "I... I don't know any lions." "They eat people," Dotty prompted, "to get their vitamins, Daddy says."

Nora found store cookies and milk, settled the children at the kitchen table, and went downstairs to tackle an overdue wash. She was hanging diapers in a long, neat line when Mrs. Finch, next door, came across the lawn.

"Whatever are you doing?" Nora took clothespins out of her mouth. "Neighboring." Mrs. Finch shaded her eyes from the last rays of the sun. Nora watched the thin lips purse and braced herself. "Honestly, Nora Linden, as if you didn't have work enough of your own! Down here doing the work of a great, strapping girl!"

"It's hard," Nora said. "Remember? You were in tears more than once." "Tears? Ever see such a house? Cry night and day."

"So did ours Fiddlesticks! Did you know?" Nora shook out a nightgown and pinned it on the line. "There's an answer to it."

"Tell me if you find it," Mrs. Finch said acidly, and went in the direction of the house.

Names and problems. Ann's name slipped in... "Help me to help her, and bless her children I pray...."

She finished hanging the clothes, went in and bathed the children and the baby. She fed them and tucked them into smooth, clean beds. The kitchen was a cheerful room, especially when she had washed the floor, and under it the living cushions that brought out the vivid coloring in six Chinese prints.

A slim book of poems lay open on the table. Nora picked it up and read the lines Ann had been reading. Nostalgia stabbed her. "When I am dead and over me bright April shakes out her rain-drenched hair...."

With the familiar lines, came the remembrance of the defenselessness of youth, the intensity and anguish of its loves. She closed the book and put it gently on the shelf.

It was almost midnight when they came home. Nora, nodding over the mending in her hands, straightened and smoothed her hair. Ann flung open the door. "Are they all right?" "Yes, indeed." Nora noted with approval the sparkle in Ann's face, the relaxed curves of her mouth. A tall, young man, with a mop of curly brown hair and a quick, white smile, looked at the place! Why can't this be a daily event?"

Nora watched the laughter die on Ann's lips. She introduced Ted, her voice low.

The children woke and, hearing voices, sent up a demanding shriek. Ted reached for the evening paper and slid into a chair. "Quiet them, Ann." Nora rose. "I'll see you along."

Be back tomorrow, around twelve." 254 Ann came with her to the door. "Thank you, are such inadequate words." "You're very welcome." Nora went eagerly down the steps and up the street toward home. They had all gone to bed. She tiptoed upstairs. Tom, senior, had fallen asleep over a magazine. She took off his glasses, put them on the night table, slid one of the two pillows out from under his head. 'Tom, junior, had taken advantage of her absence to invite Spot upstairs. The puppy's tail thumped in greeting when she tiptoed into his son's room. Carol's long lashes made half-circles on the lovely cheeks. Nora stood over her daughter for a long time. Fifteen... A tender year, fragile and fleet. Nora noted the smooth, slim fingers, no vestige of the stubby childhood hands. Soon they would be a woman's hands. Nora looked around the room, at the dress limp on the floor, the closet door open, shoes spilling out. Carol's lashes fluttered and lifted. "We had a party, Mother. Bill came. Bill Carlos!" "No!" breathed Nora, with expected enthusiasm and a wild mental groping. "Oh, yes, the high-school football star. Darling, how wonderful!" "Mother, he said he might come again." Nora bent and kissed the radiant face, inside the fierce pleading, "Help me to help her, to show her the way...." She went downstairs. The kitchen was a shambles. Glasses, plates, silverware stacked helter-skelter on the long tile drainboard. Wearily, she began to gather them up. She RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1948 thought of Ann and paused. She put the plates she had gathered back in the places where she had found them and marched upstairs into Carol's room. She shook her daughter awake. "Put on your robe and slippers and come downstairs and clean up that mess." Carol sat bolt upright. "Mother! Are you mad? Dishes this time of night?" Nora flung back the covers. "Revolting, isn't it? But I've a new job." "A new job?" Carol squeaked. She reached for her robe and fumbled about for slippers. "Mother, what on earth?" Nora, sitting on the stool by the refrigerator, eating leftover chicken, told her about Ann. "So I'm going back tomorrow, and when you come home from school you'll have to get dinner... Might as well scrub and wax this floor." Carol lifted her hands out of the soapy water. "But I've never scrubbed a floor in my life." "I know," said Nora, "neither had Ann. It's hard to learn everything at once." THE days sped by. Nora saw that she was wearing a path in the lawn where she turned down to go to Ann's house. Now Bobby and Dotty ran to meet her, fighting over her hands. Ann came swiftly to the door, lovely, eager, brimming with gratitude. Nora could not persuade her very often to leave the little house. Ann preferred to follow Nora, watching, listening, asking questions. The little house shone every day. Fragrance poured out of it, bread baking, beans simmering in molasses and mustard, apple pies browning. BRIGHT APRIL 255 her arms frighteningly so. The delicate bones showed in her neck. Was it Ted? Nora made excuses to run over in the evenings. Ann sat alone, mending or reading the thin book of poems. Nora asked, point-blank, one evening. "Ann bent her head above her mending. 'Ted? He's bowling.' 'He likes sports?' 'Mad about them, baseball, basketball, there's always something going on.' She jabbed the needle through the darning cotton. 'I used to think I couldn't go on if he didn't stay home. Now I'm glad he's gone. Glad. Glad.' " Nora's heart turned sick. She'd known, of course, that it took two. Not all Ann's effort, her courage, her willingness to learn were enough. Nora remembered Bob, in the early years of their marriage, walking the floor with the babies. He said once that something tangible and lovely came into being between two people who were doing a job together. Nora said, "I heard Ted used to be tops in scout work when he was a youngster. My sister lives in his old ward." Ann shrugged. "Now I can't get him to go to Church. I'll go alone, take the children. 'They should be learning.' She bent over her work again. Something in the young shoulders, bending so quietly to their task, made tears burn in Nora's throat. EVEN IF YOU SHOULD LEAN ABOVE ME, I SHALL NOT CARE..

She was awake when the phone rang at three and ran swiftly to answer it before the repeated rings should arouse the household. It was Ann. Dotty was very ill. The doctor was out on call. Would Nora mind coming over? Nora dressed swiftly and ran down the block. A white-faced Ted met her at the door and led her to the children's room. Nora went to Dotty's bed and leaned past Ann. Dotty's face was scarlet, her forehead dry and burning under Nora's hand. Her wheezing was the loudest thing in the room. Ann lifted the thermometer to the light. "One hundred and four," she said. Nora worked swiftly, using all the time-honored remedies. Ann fetched and carried. Ted paced from bedroom to living room window and back. "That doctor! Him?" Nora watched him bend over his daughter. He looked very young, with his tousled hair, his shirt open at the neck. The words pushed themselves out of her throat, "You... You are an elder?" Ted glanced up sharply, "Elder?

DESCRIPTIVE POETRY
LYDIA HALL
And there is one who always passes by,
As many do, in search of greening fields
And buttercups beneath an azure sky;
Who thinks he garners nature's richest yields
Because he loves a narrow country lane
Where lilacs blow; because he lingers where
Sweet grasses feel the silver touch of rain
And pampered roses freight the heavy air.
He'll live his long life through and never know
The wonder of this desert's blossoming:
"These bright-winged things that are like sunset glow
Or crimson flames that waken in the spring,
When God, more than in any other land,
Flings loveliness across the arid sand.
Sweeter Than Any Story
HAZEL K. T todd
WRITER ON THE DESK
For a brief minute she looked at the rows of keys with their millions of unwritten words. But she was too tired. Instead, she went out on the porch and sat in the late daylight on the red porch chair that had been scratched by little feet climbing up and down. It was a relief just to sit for a few minutes with no babies tugging at her skirts and no immediate pressing task. The three smallest children were in bed. Peter and Beth, seven and nine, were playing with a group of neighbor children. Frank had not come home to his evening meal yet, so she had a few minutes before she cleared away the supper things. But she had no heart for anything but just to sit.
Since before the twins were born a year and a half ago, it seemed she had hardly had a night's sleep without uncomfortable feelings or crying babies. Then there was all the sickness of the past year, tonsils and measles, and little four-year-old Terry's ruptured appendix. Now, with the thoughts of a new one to nurse through cutting teeth and all the other baby hardships, she was filled with self-pity and resentment. Besides, there were all the stories she meant to write some day. How her fingers itched sometimes to tap out on the typewriter some of the things that came and went mystically through her mind while she ironed little dresses and sewed shirt buttons. She had thought, with the children growing older, she might have a chance. But now another baby was coming to take all her time.
Across the yard in the early twilight she could see Mrs. Nelson, her newest neighbor, working in her flowers. How carefree she looked, cutting roses, slim in her cool dress with a bright kerchief around her hair. Morning and evening she had time to trim roses or tie up sweet peas. But then, she had no children, never any little dirty faces to wash, or baby food to prepare.
Now. She was running across the grass to her husband, coming up the walk. Julie bit her lip. She used to run to meet Frank. Now she wondered if she would ever run again. She watched them standing by a half dozen lilies with long, slender stalks. She had seen Mrs. Nelson fuss with them often. She looked at her own shaggy garden. Only today the twins had made the kitten a bed in the middle of her double petunias. They lay mashed and broken, just a ragged mess of leaves and wilted color.
Suddenly hot tears sprang to her eyes. It was so easy to cry now.
SHE brushed the tears away and the hair that had fallen over her face. As she did so, her glance reached across the yard again. Mrs. Nelson was looking at her curiously. She was alone, now, holding a bouquet of sweet peas. Since early spring they had lived with only a lane between them, and there had been no more conversation than a few words of greeting. Once the babies had strayed through the gate someone had left open, and she had caught them just before they went into the Nelson's yard. As she had hurried them back, she had caught Mrs. Nelson looking at her strangely.
Afraid they would get into her flowers, thought Julie. Now Mrs. Nelson was coming toward Julie's own gate with the flowers.
Page 257

At the same time Frank came around the house. Julie stood up, a little confused. "I wondered if you would like a bouquet of flowers," Mrs. Nelson asked quietly. "I didn't think you had any sweet peas." Of course she didn't have any! How could she have sweet peas when at the time they should have been planted both babies were cutting teeth, and she could barely get them out of her arms long enough to do the necessary things. "That is very thoughtful of you," Frank was saying. "You have beautiful flowers, Mrs. Nelson." Juice at last found her tongue. "Oh, yes, of course," she said, her face pink. "I don't have any." At that moment Beth and Peter came racing through the gate with laughter and excitement. At sight of the visitor, Beth, always shy, stopped by her father. But Peter, seeing the flowers, pulled down his mother's arm and buried his nose into the blossoms. "Do you like flowers?" Mrs. Nelson asked, with an amused smile. 

" Oh, sure," he said and turned a somersault which landed his shoe against the visitor's leg so that she stumbled to keep from falling. "Go into the house!" Julie spoke sharply, in humiliation. "I'm so sorry," she stammered. "Oh, that's quite all right," said Mrs. Nelson. Then, as Julie still stood embarrassed, she added, "I think my husband is waiting for me." And, turning, she walked quickly down the path. "Seems to be a pleasant person," Frank remarked. Again Julie swallowed the tears back in her throat. "If I had nothing to do but fuss with flowers, I could be pleasant, too," she snapped back at him. Frank looked at her quickly. "Julie," he said, putting his arm around her shoulder, tenderly, "this isn't like you. I know you are not well. Why don't you go to bed and get some rest?" "Rest!" she retorted. "Probably one of the babies will fuss all night." Then, hating herself for saying it, she turned, leaving him standing baffled and hurt. ER work finished, she stopped again by the typewriter and let her fingers run lightly over the keys. But there was no use to try to think of anything now. You couldn't write stories when your mind was in a turmoil and your body was tired out. She must go to bed and try to get some rest. At the door was dark-haired Beth for a good night kiss. She came to her mother a little hesitantly. Julie kissed her and watched the little girl go to her room, her dark hair bobbing up and down on her neck. She stopped by the door of the room shared by the two boys. Peter had gone to bed without saying good night. Switching on the light, she saw them lying there side by side, Peter and little Terry who had had appendicitis when he was only four. She looked at them a few minutes and then walked slowly to her own room. The little girl, she pulled were so sweet and still so small, too small to be pushed aside by another. 

The next day everything went wrong. Frank had suggested at the breakfast table that she take the children to the carnival that was in town, "I suppose that would be a pleasure to drag five children around a carnival!" she had answered impulsively. So he had gone away without saying goodbye, just as Peter had gone to bed without saying good night. All day it had rankled through her mind unpleasantly. Then the twins poured a pitcher of water into the dresser drawer. Peter and little Terry trying to clean up 4 mess of soap suds and glass on the floor. "What in the world are you doing?" gasped Julie, with a shudder at the mess. "But Mother, I was going to do the dishes and all the soap came out at once and when I was going to dip it out with the bottle, it fell and spilled everywhere," Peter said. In exasperation she slapped his face soundly. He looked shocked and frightened, and then ran crying into the bedroom. The twins took up the chorus and screamed loudly at the unexpected things happening. Peter slipped silently through the kitchen door, and Beth began fearfully to pick up bits of glass from the floor.

When the confusion had subsided, Julie, out on the porch, tried to calm herself. She sat on the scratched chair and folded her hands in her lap. Fence. She watched the bright colors sway and nod gently, her body gradually becoming relaxed. In a few short seconds her thoughts were off and away, past the land of crying babies, broken dishes, and unprepared dinners. In her mind new characters came into existence, walked mistily through new paths, and spoke bits of fascinating conversation. But suddenly they were the wrong words. "See! See!" Then tiny muddy fingers caught hers and wrapped themselves around her own. Away flew the land of enchantment on wings of suddenness.

Before her stood a little girl and a little boy, each with a tall flower clasped in a muddy hand, a tall flower, 4 stem and dangling roots. "Oh!" groaned Julie. "Mrs. Nelson's lilies, the ones she was showing her husband!" She snatched the flowers quickly from the two little muddy hands that reached vainly into the air. Pushing them away, she started down the porch steps, the two whimpering babies following her.

This was something that must be explained, apologized for. But how could she make Mrs. Nelson understand that children, something she had never had, could do impossible things. She must have left the gate unfastened herself when she hurried back with the two older children. Oh, what in the world could she say? At the door she rang the bell and waited, the two babies hanging to her skirt with muddy hands.

At last the door was opened and Mrs. Nelson looked into her face quizzically, then at the lilies, "My babies—they must have slipped through the gate and, Mrs. Nelson, I am so sorry, they have pulled up your lilies!" Mrs. Nelson's gaze went from the flowers to the children. "Oh, so you pulled my flowers," she said.

The two crept farther behind the mother, and Mrs. Nelson laughed. JULIE was thunderstruck. Was she using this way to shame her for the thing her children had done! She put an arm protectingly around each little neck, "I cannot replace them of course, Mrs. Nelson, but I assure you that they shall not come into your yard any more." With a quick gesture she took the babies by the hand, biting her lip to keep back the tears.

But she was detained by a hand on her shoulder, "Please do not go." Julie looked up into the strange expression. "I didn't mean to embarrass you. Don't you see, I am not concerned about the flowers? I can have more flowers. I was wondering why you always take your children away from me so soon."

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�APRIL 1948

"I know you have a lot to do and cannot always keep track of them." Julie could hold back the tears no longer. Dropping on the couch, she buried her face in her hands and cried bitterly, while two scared little children clung to her skirts and whimpered. She heard Mrs. Nelson speaking to them in a quiet voice, felt her take them away gently, and presently she could hear her talking brightly about shoes and cars and airplanes from a magazine that rattled as she turned the pages. Then Julie felt a soft touch on her shoulder. "Can you tell me what is the matter?" Julie forgot her restraint. "It's just that I'm going to have another," she said through quivering lips, "another baby!" Mrs. Nelson looked at her in astonishment, "But surely that is nothing to cry about." "But I already have five!" wailed Julie. "Five to cook and sew for; I never have any time to do anything for myself." "She wiped the tears away. "Don't you see, there are things I should like to do too, like you plant flowers. Well, I have always wanted to write stories." The words tumbled out, one after another, and suddenly sounded so childish to Julie that she dropped her eyes miserably. Mrs. Nelson was silent. Presently Julie looked at her, but she was staring at the babies now, happily looking at magazines. She said without turning her eyes, "You know, I would give all the flowers I could ever raise, all the stories in SWEETER THAN ANY STORY in the world, if I could just have one little child like that!" Julie looked at her in amazement. "You mean you would like children? I thought...." "Yes, I know you thought I didn't want children because they would spoil my flowers. I raise flowers because I cannot raise babies. I can never know what it is to feel my little soft baby in my arms, and feel its tiny hand on my face as I have seen babies do. You," she turned and looked at Julie, and the anguish in her face wrenched Julie's heart, "you have had five babies to cuddle. Now you are going to have another one, but I must go on with my foolish flowers!" Her eyes were misty, and she wiped them quickly. "Forgive me," she said again. "I am sorry if I have sounded harsh. I know you are tired. But if I could just make you realize what priceless treasures you have." 

JULIE was ashamed. She had never been so ashamed in her life before. If it had been a gentle rebuke, she had certainly needed it. Now she saw how foolish she had been acting lately; how unfair she had treated Frank that morning; how irritable she had been with the children. The slim figure sat beside her, and laid her hand on Julie's. "Why don't you let me help you? It would be a pleasure to watch the children while you have a rest or go to a movie with your husband, and let me help you sew for the new one. What a thrill it would be to make little things for a baby! If you knew how hungry I have been to hold one of your twins, to brush little Jane's curls!" 

261 Julie felt fresh and new. "Oh, thank you so much, Mrs. Nelson!" "My name is Ruth, and let me call you Julie." "Thank you, Ruth." Then she remembered it was nearly suppertime. Frank would be home, and she wanted to have something he especially liked. Maybe there was time for an apple pie. "I'd better be going." She stood up and started for the babies. But Ruth caught her hand. "Please let them stay awhile." So she left them, still happy with their magazines. Then, as she came up the steps of the porch, she thought of little Terry. She had punished him because he had tried to help. A sudden need to have his forgiveness awakened in her. She found him on his bed asleep, his little tear-stained face streaked with dirt. His shirt was pulled out, revealing the long appendicitis scar, vivid to her now as a token of remembrance. How could she have scolded him for breaking a bottle of water? What did it matter if he had spilled a dozen bottles of water? How glad, how lucky, she was to have him. She dropped to the bedside and stroked the hair of his head tenderly. 

The child stirred in his sleep, then opened large brown eyes, unknowingly, first, then, seeing his mother's face friendly and close beside his own, he smiled warmly with no trace of past grievances, and gave her a big kiss on the cheek. "Mother, why are you crying?" Julie brushed the moisture away. "Oh, I guess I'm just happy, Terry." And she knew that the warmth of her arms around him was all he needed to understand why she cried when she was glad. Then, while she sat with him in her lap, she thought of the stories she meant to write some day. There would be long years ahead when the children would be grown and away in houses of their own, with their own little Terrys. Then she could write stories, and they would be filled with the smiles of little children twining around the heart, with the mischief of twins, and with dark hair bobbing up and down on a shy girl's neck. Oh, they would be sweeter than any other stories! Her thoughts were interrupted by Beth and Peter, who came trooping into the room, glad to find their mother in a happier mood. Then the twins came home, each with a clothespin doll. "See! See!" they said joyously, holding out the dolls in chubby hands. "Mother, read us a story." It was Peter, with his tongue in the vacant spot of his upper tooth row. "Please do," put in Beth, and the twins added, "Tory, Tory," as if they knew what a story was. It was here Frank found them when he came home, unheard. Julie looked up and saw joyous relief in his face. "What is this?" he said with a grin. "Daddy, daddy!" piped the twins racing to reach him first. "Mother, read us a story," announced Beth standing up and straightening her pinafore. "Yes," agreed Julie, "I was going to make an apple pie, but I read a story." "What I found tonight," - said Frank, with his eyes on Julie, "was sweeter than any story."

FROM LOAM OF LEBANON
Dorothy J. Roberts

Sown with the kernel of his word, suspended, still,
Waiting the promise of an Easter sun,
The shadow of the cross fell dark upon the hill,
Winter-dark, as loam of Lebanon.

After the sorrow and the waning light,
Its full-blow flower of fertility
Burst into a bloom so vast and bright
It gilded the riffled blue of Galilee.

Now every sea, the Easter time returning,
Repeats upon its breast the ancient gold
And every Easter Sabbath, children, learning,
Mark the lily, from a tomb, unfold.

And Bethany, Capernaum, Judea, The loved geography disciples know, The sepulcher of him from Arimathaea, Gleam eternal in the lasting afterglow.

Chapter 3 (Conclusion)

JOE opened his eyes and stared unbelievably at Anne, standing near his bed. "How—when—did you come?" he gasped.

Anne bent over and kissed him. "Never mind, dear. I've come; that's all that matters."

"I'm so sorry," he said weakly, "I didn't get you away from there before this happened. It must be terrible for you out there alone with the kiddies. Delia was right. I should never have taken you away from town in the beginning. I'm glad you came. I want you to get Hadfield to take over. He can have the crop for anything he wants to give. You bring the children and come back to your mother's at once. I'll be out again in a couple of months—I hope."

"Joe, will you please stop talking," cried Anne, drawing a chair close to his bed in the little white hospital room. "Why, you're feverish."

"I'm the farmer now, dear, and I'm turning nothing over to Hadfield. What I'm anxious about is what have you turned over to him?"

Joe looked confused. "Well, honey, agreed to take what he offered. I could see I had to let the place go, and he was the only one who would give me anything."

Joe's face clouded, and he struggled to lift his head.

"Say, has he been bothering you?" Anne smiled.

"Not exactly, but he's going to. He says he gave you a down payment, and now he wants me to leave everything."

"Oh, yes, the check. I've never cashed it."

"Can we manage to get along without it?"

"You know better than I do, dear."

"Well, we can!" Anne made up her mind instantly, and felt new strength.

"Forgive me, dear, for being so impatient. I know now that I don't want to sell the homestead. I've learned to love it."

Tears and smiles lighted Anne's sensitive face at the same moment, and she struggled under a great emotion.

"Darling!" exclaimed Joe, "do you really mean it?"

He tried again to raise himself so that he could look squarely into her sparkling eyes to make sure he had not heard wrong.

"I know I can make it worth while—if you'll stay a little longer."

Suddenly, he fell back on his pillow weakly. "But Hadfield'll never let it go," he murmured in a tone of stark disillusionment.

Anne threw herself down by him and broke into sobs.

"I'm sorry, so sorry, dear. It's my fault."

Back on the homestead in a few days she took up her task again. The heat and drought of the late summer were forcing the wheat toward maturity, yet at the same time driving the ravenous squirrels down from the hills and the fly-pestered cattle along the sagging fences.

Fighting the squirrels and keeping back the cattle were like fighting a war. Anne tried to carry out the analogy in her own mind. For the life of her she had never been able to picture the tremendous clashes of two opposing armies. But she did understand, now, the meaning of struggle against elemental forces in nature, and she was learning the strategy of combat.

She could leave Dick and Betsy playing in the dry creek bed while she lugged a heavy bucket of poisoned oats around the wheat field, criss-crossing through it a half dozen times until her body was wet with perspiration, and her mouth was as dry as cotton. She could also set a broken fence post, tie and tighten a broken strand of barbed wire, even drive the cattle back over the ridge, yelling at them until she was hoarse.

She could do all this, and more, at the same time worrying lest a snake or a porcupine molest her chickens or her children. Then there was Joe lying in the hospital. The latest reports indicated he might have to have another operation on one of his legs. She often found relief in tears, but she also smiled bravely, and inwardly rejoiced over the discovery of hidden strength in her own nature.

She laughed and joked with Dickie and Betsy, and made up whimsical little games by which she turned their daily duties into play. She even laughed at her hard, blistered hands and brown face.

"What would Della say now," she wondered.

Suddenly Joe started to write regularly. He had his arm and one of his legs out of the cast, and RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948 what was even more wonderful, the threatened second operation was not going to be necessary.

"Just a little longer," he declared, "and I'll be out. Then you're going to have it easy the rest of your life. I'm already dickering again for the house I hoped to get in the first place. My first act is going to be to get you into it."

She wrote back, without mentioning the house:

"I went up to the top of the hill last night and let the breeze blow in my face for an hour while I thought of you and watched the lights come on in the valley. Oh, how I wished you were here."

A week before the grain was ready to cut, Hadfield rounded up a bunch of his hungry cattle and put them in his dry pasture above the Raines homestead.

Anne woke at dawn to hear the defiant bellowing of a range bull. Before she was out of bed, the crashing of a post and the whining of tight wires, giving way before the impact of heavy bodies, smote her ears. She sprang to her feet and ran outside. At least twenty head of hungry cattle were fanning out at the top of the wheat field, tearing it up in great bunches with their huge mouths and trampling it under foot while a score of others were coming over the ridge, bent on similar destruction.

"Whoo-oo-oo," she cried running up the hill. Halfway through the wheat, she felt her lungs burning from the exertion but kept on.

"Whoo-oo-oo," she cried again, nearing the first animal. "Get out of here! Sic 'em, get out of here!"

Whirling her hat in her hand, she attacked the animal with a fury that made her feel capable of tearing it to pieces with her bare hands.

Windy Hilltop

But the bovine giant merely ran a few paces and turned to look at her with oxlike stolidity as if wondering if she were some new kind of fly or other nuisance. She ran at another of the animals, shouting and clapping her hands. But they merely circled around in the grain, tearing more of it up with their great mouths and wallowing more under their feet.

Others were pouring in along the edge of the wheat. Anne's temples throbbed, her heartbeat choked her, and she realized with sudden terror that she was on the verge of collapse. But she couldn't stop. Something had to be done.

She wished blindly she had the power to wave her arm and strike this terrific mass of invading power dead with a single stroke. She was in the midst of the milling herd now, but danger to herself never came to her mind. Once she would have been frightened to death at the more presence of these wild, relentless animals, but at the moment, she was aware only of the havoc they were doing to her precious wheat. She was thinking of the hard work Joe had done, plowing, harrowing and planting it. She remembered the night he had come down to the corral with the dog after finishing the last round. He was as black as a negro, she had said, but as lighthearted as a schoolboy, and she had gone out to meet him in one of her most dissatisfied moods.

"Whoo-ooo," she cried. "Get out of here!"

Suddenly, the cattle stirred uneasily, as if the very desperation of her efforts had at last stricken them with fear. In a moment they began moving back out of the grain, starting at first slowly, then breaking to 265 a run.

Then, for the first time, Anne realized a dog was barking and nipping savagely at their heels. Man's voice, too, broke upon the morning stillness, echoing along the ridge like shrill thunder. She saw him ride down the gully, jumping his horse over the sagging wires, and circling around the remnants of the cattle with amazing speed.

Of course it was Hadfield. "Confound it!" he yelled, "I'll be glad when you get this wheat cut. We'll have nothing but trouble now they've found it."

He passed in a flash of speed. This long-limbed, hawklike man in a broad-brimmed hat and high-heeled boots seemed like a character riding directly out of the pages of an adventure story. How could anyone cope with him?

Anne drew her arm over her hot, perspiring face and sank down on a boulder.

A few minutes later, she was aware he had come back. "When'll Joe be home?" Hadfield demanded. "I don't know," she said. She looked up, half admiring Hadfield's magnificent strength. She could never have driven the cattle out alone. "Thanks for helping me," she murmured. "I'll fix the fence," he replied, not unkindly.

ANNE was numb with weariness when she started down through the wheat, and the morning sunshine was directly in her face. She was nearly down to the house, therefore, before she realized a car had Betsy running from the house. Realized it was time she could bring all her tired faculties to bear on the scene, she not only saw Della but also Joe getting out of the car. Then she found herself running again, her weariness forgotten.

He came toward her with the help of his cane. "Oh, Joe, Joe, darling, I'm so glad!" she cried, almost collapsing in his arms. "Sweetheart," he murmured, holding her tightly. "This has been terrible for you. But it's all over now. I've bargained for the place in town. We're going to move."

Anne braced herself with sudden alertness. "But darling, the wheat's got to be cut. I've arranged for the headers to come next week. Then of course, you know we've got to thresh. Besides there's a lot of stuff in the garden yet to dig. Why, we've got enough food to last us all winter."

"Honey, I saw you chasing those cattle when we were down in the valley, and I knew what a killing ordeal you were having. I've tried it myself. And I said to Della then, 'Sis, you're right, the meanest thing I ever did was to bring Anne out to this forsaken place." Joe's voice quivered. "But, dear, you're here now. Everything'll be easy. I don't want to leave, not yet. Our job isn't finished here. I'm a changed woman, Joe; I've learned to see so many things your way."

"And I've learned to see things your way," protested Joe. "I guess it was just stupid of me to get so attached to this place." They began to follow Della and the children to the house, but before they had gone many steps, they were aware of Hadfield riding into the yard.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948

"Hello, Joe," he said. "I'm glad to see you back, and I want to tell you this little wife of yours has sure looked after things." Hadfield leaned on the horn of his saddle and looked down into their serious faces. "I hope your legs are all right."

"They'll be as good as ever in a few more weeks," replied Joe.

"Well, how about the deal?" Hadfield came to the point. "Oh, yes, the deal for the place. Well, honestly, Mr. Hadfield, we've decided not to sell for the present, but we'll still give you a chance if we decide to later," replied Joe, reaching the decision so quickly he was half-afraid and looked at Anne to see if she approved.

"That's right," said Anne. "We're going to make ever so many improvements first, however, so we can get a good price for it."

Hadfield's face clouded. "I've already made a payment on it, you know." "Oh, yes, the check." Joe fumbled in his pocket and finally produced the one evidence of the sale. "Here it is. You see, I didn't cash it. I was able to make other arrangements for my hospital bill." He held it up, but Anne took it and tore it to bits.

"Mr. Hadfield doesn't want it. His money's all in the bank and everybody's happy," Anne laughed impudently, then hysterically, but in a moment she was crying again. "You won't try to hold us to it, will you?"

The scowl on Hadfield's hawklike face broadened into a grin. "You win," he said, "good luck."

THE sporting wind was cool and soothing when Anne and Joe reached the hilltop to watch the sun go down, and a lone hawk was spreading its wings to cut a true course directly against the current. Hand in hand, they stood silent against the benediction of the sky, surrounded by the vast solitude.

"How often I pictured this place in my mind when I was lying in the hospital," Joe said reflectively. "And were unhappy to think of losing it," prompted Anne.

Joe grinned. "Yes, I admit it."

They surveyed their rough acres, partly subdued by their toil, and a mutual pride of achievement possessed them. "Darling," said Anne, "as soon as you were hurt, and I started to feel responsible, I began to love everything here, and with you gone, I began to realize how it bound us together."

Fervently, he drew her to him. "Dear, you are wonderful. I don't believe any other man ever had such a heroic little wife. And because of that, your little cottage in town is still going to come true." She looked up questioningly.

"We're about the last of the homesteaders, and we can be thankful to have had such an opportunity. This humble heritage should always be ours and our children's. I have a good trade, and there are still other things I can do in the winter.

And, you know, we don't owe anything on this place." Anne caught the vision instantly. "What wonderful summers we'll have here while the children are growing up, and what grand things we'll raise to eat. All our friends in town will be jealous because we have a country home and a city home, too." She laughed as the wind blew her golden hair in wisps about her face. Looking up, she saw the hawk make a magnificent dive into the wind. "Our wings are set right," she murmured, putting her lips up to be kissed.

A New Coat for an Old One
Blanche N. Coe Would like to convert an old, straight coat into a new, flared model to wear with full, long dresses? By carefully following the directions given in this article, you can perform this transformation. Before you begin the remodeling process, carefully observe the way in which the bottom of the coat is finished so that you can refinish the new one in the same way.

First, make a chalk mark around the sleeve halfway between the inside of the elbow joint and the wrist joint. Cut at the chalk mark. (See Diagram A). Carefully press with a damp cloth the pieces you have cut off as you are going to use them later. Open the underarm seam of the sleeve almost to the armhole. Also open the inside seam of the lining of the sleeve almost to the armhole. Remove the padding at the top of the sleeve and at the shoulder and insert the new-style padding for the shoulder. After you have placed pad correctly, put a tailor's mitt in the top of the sleeve and shoulder, cover with a cloth wrung from warm water, and steam-press into shape.

If the material in your coat won't shrink into a nice shape, the top of the armhole seam can be opened and part of the old sleeve cut out to make it fit the new pad. With a thin piece of tailor's chalk, or a piece of soap, mark the new hemline of the coat evenly, about a quarter of an inch below the finger-tips when the hands are hanging at Page 268 the sides. Use a yardstick so that the bottom of the coat is exactly the same distance from the floor at every point. Cut on the dotted line of the chalk marks. (See Diagram A).

Diagram B represents one of the pieces cut off from each sleeve. From each piece cut a triangle (1.) with which to widen the sleeves (See Diagram C). Make a triangle pattern with paper as long as the arm seam opening and as wide as the goods allows and lay the pattern on the cloth as shown in Diagram B. Sew the flare (triangle) in place as shown in Diagram C, with the wide part of the triangle at the bottom of the sleeve.

Open the side seams of the coat and lining almost to the armhole. From the piece which you have cut off the bottom of the coat cut two flares, (triangles 2 and 3), to put into the side openings of the coat, one for each side. Also cut the circular pieces (4) to be put in the bottom of each sleeve from this same piece of material. Cut these circles as large as possible. The diagrams (D-1 and D-2) show two ways of doing this.

If the piece of material cut from the bottom of the coat is sufficiently wide, and the pattern of the material is such that it can be used crosswise, then cut as in Diagram D-1. If the pattern of the material, however, such as a stripe, cannot be used crosswise, then cut as in Diagram D-2.

Join the pieces carefully, matching the notches of 2 and 3, and press the seams well before joining them to the sides of the coat. Sew the straight side of the triangle to the front seam of the coat. Sew the circles to the bottom of the sleeves (Diagram E). Bind the inside of the circle to form a cuff at the wrist. Press all the seams carefully with a steam iron or with a cloth wrung from warm water.

Use the same pattern and method of cutting and sewing for making the lining into a flare, and for making the new lining for the sleeves. A different material may be needed to line the sleeve circle. You observed the original bottom finish on your old coat. Even the side flares and finish the new coat the same way.

And here's your new coat (Diagram F). It's Fun to Make Pie
Velma N. Simonsen Second Counselor, General Presidency of Relief Society

IT'S fun to make pie, and it is quick and easy if you use a pastry cloth and a rolling pin jacket! These can be purchased in any store, but it is much cheaper to make your own.

Buy a piece of white canvas at any farm store. The canvas comes in various widths from 30 inches to 60 inches. Two-thirds of a yard of the 30-inch canvas will make two pastry cloths. Cut the edges with pinking shears or turn a small narrow hem on the raw edges.

For the rolling pin jacket buy a small pair of child's white stockings, cut off the feet, and you have two rolling pin jackets. Pull one jacket over the rolling pin. If the stocking is too long turn the ends back in on themselves.

Before using, work or rub as much flour into the jacket and cloth as they will absorb. Do not leave excess flour on the surface. Also use the cloth and jacket to roll cookies, doughnuts, rolls, noodles, or any rolled dough. With this pastry cloth and rolling pin jacket you can handle a much softer dough as they never stick and the dough to the board and the rolling pin. They also eliminate frequent adding of flour when making pastry, thereby assuring you of lighter and more tender pie crusts.

Have you ever tried hot water pie crust? Here is a never-fail recipe:

1 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup shortening
1 cup boiling water

Pour boiling water over shortening and beat until creamy. Sift in flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir and roll out. Makes 2 crusts.

Many recipes advise chilling in the ice box, but with a pastry cloth this is unnecessary, and warm dough is easier to handle and makes a more flaky crust.

Bake at oven temperature suitable for the type and size of the pie, between 400° and 550° F.

The "Basic-Seven" Pattern for Nutrition
Bernice Stookey Linford Iron County, Utah, Home Agent

PHYSICAL health is necessary for mental and spiritual growth and well-being. We eat food primarily for nutrition. Food at best is expensive, but malnutrition is often found in families which spend the most money for food. This may be due to lack of information and poor selection or preparation. Many overweight people are malnourished because they do not have a balanced diet.

A food pattern for health is definitely included in the Word of Wisdom, as well as the harmful effects of the use of liquor, tobacco, tea, coffee, and drug-containing drinks.
". . . all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man—Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly . . . . All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth (D. & C. 89:10 ff.)."

"In the season thereof" may, in my opinion, refer to natural foods at proper maturity—fresh or properly preserved.

Each day we read warnings written by food specialists urging us to eat more natural foods, not only to ensure health, but to build resistance against disease. Disease always follows or goes hand in hand with hunger, the aftermath of war.

Vitamins are vital substances found in natural, fresh, and properly prepared foods. They regulate body processes and build up resistance against disease. "The destroying angel shall pass by them"—can this not mean that health could be so fortified that disease germs could be thrown from the body? Vitamin D, so potent in protecting health, is manufactured in the body by exposing the skin to direct sunlight.

Food, "in the season thereof," eaten raw, cooked, canned, or frozen, is rich in vitamins. The cost, in many cases, can be reduced more than 100%, and the food is more wholesome and better flavored if prepared at home. A well-balanced diet, including, each day, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, mineral salts, vitamins, and water will supply body needs without adding synthetic vitamins.

The following "basic-seven" pattern is recommended by the National Food and Nutrition Board. It is recognized as an ideal health pattern. Include some foods from each group in the diet each day.
MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS
Fluid milk (adults, 1 pint; children, ½ to 1 quart; expectant and nursing mothers, 1 quart)
If fluid milk is unavailable or unsafe,
Page 271 a 1-pint can of evaporated milk or ¼ cup dried milk are equivalent to 1 quart fluid milk. Ice cream and various types of cheese, too, can be used to make up this group—American cheese, and cottage cheese.

GREEN AND YELLOW VEGETABLES (One or more servings)
Cabbage
Broccoli
Lettuce
Carrots
Spinach
Sweet Potatoes
Asparagus
Yellow squash
Peas
Pumpkin
Beans
Yellow turnips

ORANGES, TOMATOES, GRAPEFRUIT (One or more servings)
Fresh or canned juices
Raw cabbage
Raw vegetables in salad

POTATOES AND OTHER VEGETABLES AND FRUITS (One or more servings)
Potatoes (at least once daily)
Grapes (fresh or canned, frozen beans or dried)
Cauliflower
Berries
Onions
Melons
Com Cantaloupes
Turnips
Peaches
Pears
Dates
Apples
Figs
Radishes
Prunes

MEAT, POULTRY, FISH, ECEs (One serving of meat, poultry, or fish daily)
One egg daily (at least four a week)
Dried beans: (an excellent source of calcium, as well as of minerals and protein )
Peas
Nuts
Peanut Butter

BREAD, FLOUR AND CEREALS (Enriched or whole-grain)
Bread, or its equivalent at each meal, according to age and energy needs of the individual.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—APRIL 1948
BUTTER AND FORTIFIED MARGARINE VITAMIN A ADDED
Two to three level tablespoons. Serve some with each meal.
Other animal and vegetable fats as needed.
Six to eight glasses of water should be included in each daily diet. A glass of warm water taken early in the morning is beneficial.
'The juice of one half lemon added to the water and taken thirty minutes before breakfast, before any food is taken into the body, is an effective regulator and also corrects bad Families with low incomes may find it impossible to include as much meat, poultry, and butter as desired, but in all diets it is recommended to include liver, heart, or kidney, at least once a week.
Liver is our most valuable meat. Liver from calves, beef, pork, or sheep is similar in nutritive value. The milder the flavor, the higher the price. Stronger flavored liver may be ground and sage, onion, celery, and bread crumbs added to make liver loaf.
If changes must be made because of low income, natural molasses, soybeans, dried beans and peas, peanut butter, and rice—especially brown rice—should be included often. Increase the use of whole grains, as whole-wheat cereals and breads. Serve more fruits and vegetables, fresh, canned, frozen, or dried.
But most important, increase milk and milk products. Milk is our most perfect food. It supplies energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals. It is our best insurance against diet deficiencies. It is also our best source of calcium, which is essential for the functioning of every cell in the body, for building teeth, bones, and blood, and for all body processes.
When meat, cheese, and fluid milk are scarce, or unsafe because cows are not properly tested, dried milk can be used. Dried whole milk should be kept under refrigeration, since the fat becomes rancid. Dried skimmed milk may be used in many ways and is very reasonable in price. One half cup of dried milk contains milk solids equal to one quart of fresh milk.
Use it in creamed soups, breads, gravies, puddings, ice cream, cookies, and add it to cooked YELLOW VEGETABLES. Cereals.
Dried milk has the advantage, too, that an extra amount can be added, if necessary, for protection of health. For cooking, it is much easier and quicker to measure out the amount needed for the recipe, then mix or sift the dried milk with the dry ingredients, instead of putting it in with the moisture, as is usually done in recipes. The particles of milk absorb moisture very slowly; it takes a long time for the milk, if mixed with water, to make a smooth paste, but it can be done quickly by putting milk in a small (Continued on page 285)

FROM THE FIELD
Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer

REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUBMITTAL OF MATERIAL FOR "NOTES FROM THE FIELD"
(All notes and photographs are to be submitted through stake and mission Relief Society presidents).

This section of the Magazine is reserved for narrative reports and pictures of Relief Society activities in the stakes and missions.

Its purpose is threefold: (1) to provide a medium for the exchange of ideas and methods for conducting Relief Society work which have proved successful in some organizations and which may be helpful and stimulating to others; (2) to recognize outstanding or unique accomplishments of Relief Society organizations; (3) to note the progress of Relief Society work in various parts of the world. It is recognized that personal accounts of individuals who have long served Relief Society, or who have otherwise distinguished themselves, are always of great interest, but the space available for "Notes From the Field" is so limited in relation to the number of stakes and missions that it must be reserved for reports on the work of the organization rather than that of individuals. Wards and branches desiring to submit reports for publication in "Notes From the Field" are requested to send them through the stake or mission presidents. It often happens that one or two wards or branches in a stake or mission will send reports on special activities which are being conducted on a stake-wide or mission-wide basis, and, in such instances, it would be to the advantage of the stake or mission to have the report cover the entire activity in the same issue of the Magazine, with all participating wards or branches represented. Reports and photographs should be submitted as promptly as possible after the events described have taken place in order that they may be published while the activities are still of current interest. Where narrative reports are submitted, with or without accompanying photographs, the name of the stake and ward, or mission and branch, should be given together with the title of the activity reported, the date, and other pertinent data, including the name, address, and position of the person making the report. Pictures which are submitted for publication can be used only if they are clear and distinct and will make good cuts for reproduction. Black and white glossy prints reproduce most satisfactorily. Pictures should have the following information written clearly on the back: Name of stake and ward, or mission and branch Title of picture, stating the activity represented or the purpose Date picture was taken Name, address, and position in Relief Society of person submitting the picture Identification of persons in the picture should be made on the reverse side. Names should be given from left to right, written clearly, and spelled correctly. The given names of the women should be used, not their husbands' names (for instance, Sarah D. Erickson, not Mrs. James Erickson). The positions of the executive officers: president, counselors, and secretary-treasurer If the photograph has reference to some particular activity, such as sewing, visiting teaching, etc., the name of the leader and her position should also be listed. Material submitted for "Notes From the Field" should be addressed to the General Secretary-Treasurer of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah.

FINLAND MISSION, HELSINKI BAZAAR

Sister Mae Matis reports that none of the articles in this bazaar were made from new material and yet each article was beautifully made and will be very serviceable. In commenting upon the activities of our Finnish sisters, President Matis writes: "From this faraway country the sisters of the Relief Society send their choicest greetings.... We now have four active Relief Society groups in Finland, at Helsinki, Turku, Larsmo, and Jacobstad. All the sisters are willing and anxious to do their part and we are looking forward with a great deal of anticipation.

'Two of the groups held bazaars in December. I admired their spirit to even try with so little material to work with. It is impossible to buy material or yarn of any kind here. The sisters unraveled old sweaters, socks, and shawls which had already been made over several times and remade them. They were happy with their efforts and it was a goal for them to work toward."

(Worse, she had forgotten his birthday. She had forgotten everything but this. She looked critically at the paper, and for a moment her heart pounded with pride; but even work socks would have been better than nothing. In quick anger, she started to tear the paper across. No-o. No. This was Starlight. Strangers had lost the stallion, but she had him. He could never run away from her. Run away? She could find the Indian camp. The Indians liked her as she was. They wouldn't expect her to earn money, but she couldn't leave Papa, no matter what.)

THE family was at the supper table when she stumbled into the kitchen, tired and heartsick. Immediately three pairs of eyes were turned toward her. "Was Mrs. Home late getting home?" Marie asked. "I didn't see her in town." "Likely they were at Stangers," Levi said. "I heard they caught Starlight." "See the package Mama sent and Papa likes his hat so well he won't take it off," Marie added.

Gloria wet her lips with her tongue. The hat was wonderful. Papa cocked his head to one side to show off. The fun in his eyes was more than she could stand. "Did you lose your tongue?" Levi demanded, "I know," Marie's voice took on that know-it-all tone. "She has her pencils. You didn't buy Papa a birthday present, did you?"

The old pec'cy pain tightened inside Gloria. Her eyes stung and her heart was broken in two, but she would not let Marie know. "Course, I brought him something." "Where is it? Why don't you give it to him?" They all waited. She kept her eyes away from Papa. If only she had found a horse— if only she had tried to find one, but she hadn't remembered.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�APRIL 1948 "Did you lead him home or did he just follow you?" The defiance in Gloria crumbled fast. Her nostrils flared, but her head was high and her voice steady. "Here he is, Papa." The sudden stillness was horrible. Papa held the paper before him.

He pushed back his hat to get the benefit of the fading light. Marie and Levi were back of him, looking over his shoulder. Gloria waited. If he would scold her she could stand it. "Glory! Glory!" was all he said, and in a frenzy of regret she threw herself into his arms. "I do love you, Papa," she sobbed. "Don't believe her when she says I don't love you. I love you more than all the world." One hand still held the paper to the light, and it was trembling. With the other arm, he drew her close against him. There was a queer note in his voice when he spoke, as if he were laughing and crying at the same time. "Glory, you have killed my pecancy humor. We shall never use the word again." Marie and Levi exchanged glances. This was queer talk, even for Papa. "It is good, isn't it? I mean really - good?" Marie had forgotten her impatience. "I'll bet anyone who has seen Starlight would recognize it," Levi added. 

Papa spoke to all of them. "Some day this sketch will be exhibited as an example of the early work of a famous painter of animals in action. This is the most precious gift a man ever received." Gloria looked into his eyes and THE GIFT knew that something very special had happened to him, and it was her drawing that had done it. Once again that pain swelled and swelled inside her, but it was not pec'cy anymore.

The Basic-Seven Pattern for Nutrition (Continued from page 273)

To thicken soups, add a small amount of flour or cornstarch to cold water in a separate bowl, mix well, then stir into the soup. Use a wooden spoon to blend thoroughly. For gravies and sauces, use the same method but add more thickener as needed.

Whole-wheat cereals and flour, brown, unpolished rice, oats, and other whole-grain products contain the "enrichment and vitamins" nature produced in them. They are more valuable as food and less expensive than synthetically enriched flours and cereals.

Far-sighted home-makers will protect health by including daily in the family diet milk and milk products; fruit and vegetables; meats, fish, cheese, or eggs; cereals, whole-grain or enriched breads; butter, margarine, or other animal and vegetable fats. They will reduce expense by planting gardens and preserving food at home.

With "prudence and thanksgiving," they will gather the harvest in the time of plenty "in the season thereof" and store it for the lean days to come.
