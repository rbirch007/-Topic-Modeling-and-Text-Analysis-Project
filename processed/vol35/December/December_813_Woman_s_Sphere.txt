Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon

EMMA LUCY GATES, wife of Elder Albert E. Bowen of the Council of the Twelve, and granddaughter of President Brigham Young, was signally honored by the citizens of Utah and outstanding musical friends when more than 2,500 music lovers gathered at a testimonial in the Assembly Hall, Temple Square, October 25, 1948. A specially selected chorus and forty members of the Utah Symphony opened the program with Bach's "Magnificat," the work in which Mrs. Bowen made her debut in Berlin in 1900. It was the audience itself which "commanded" the once great star of European and American concert and opera stages to close the testimonial with the singing of the role of Violetta in the "disintegration" scene from the third act of Verdi's "La Traviata" which had just been presented as closing selection with many former students of Mrs. Bowen signing as soloists and members of the chorus. An appreciative and well-earned tribute which touched the hearts of the audience was paid Mrs. Bowen by her accomplished friend Becky Almond. The response by Mrs. Bowen was in perfect taste. The entire proceeds of the testimonial were given to the Utah Building Fund.

IN St. George, Utah, a drugstore is owned and operated entirely by women.

JUST off the press is a book of poems, beautifully bound in maroon and gold, titled Wayside Whispering. The author is Grace M. Candland, well-known Utah poet, whose work has frequently appeared in Church magazines.

IN little stone houses on a fifty-five acre reservation in central Arizona live eight Indian families who constitute the Yavapai tribe. They are governed by Viola Jimulla, sixty-seven years old, the only woman in the United States who rules an Indian tribe. However, a three-man council can outvote her.

IN Bristol, England, at a Methodist conference, women speakers opposed a resolution that women should be accepted as ministers.

MARVA BANKS LINDSAY of Salt Lake City has been appointed to a national post in the field of education. She will serve on the national committee on teacher preparation and professional standards of the National Education Association, and will live in Washington, D. C., during her three-year term of service.

"The Heavens Declare the Glory"
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork (Psalm 19:1).

WHEN the seasons are fulfilled and Christmas comes again, we think of the story of the Wise Men of the East and the sign in the heavens that guided them across the mountains and the deserts to the manger at Bethlehem. Christmas is truly a time for considering the stars and all the "handywork" of God.

For centuries the stars have been to the earthbound a symbol of that which endures in beauty and serenity. Today, in the midst of much tumult, in the confusion and conflict of ideas and ideologies, we turn with a spiritual yearning to that which seems steadfast, to eternal patterns, and to everlasting law.

Many travelers have observed that the stars which are visible in the Holy Land seem more beautiful than those in any other place in all the world. This may, perhaps, be explained by the fact that Palestine is largely desert country, rifted by mountains and cut by gullies. And in contrast to this wilderness which is the land, the stars shine with utmost brilliance and they seem to be very near to earth.

Above the hills of the East appeared the new star, a fulfillment of prophecy, a guide, and a beacon. The Magi followed that star with implicit faith akin to that high spiritual dedication with which many in succeeding ages have followed the gospel of which the star was a symbol. And many have thought of the message that Jesus brought to the earth as being like unto the stars in its steadfast shining.

It has been said that the heavens are an open book in which the stars are golden letters. Yet there is much that men, without revelation, cannot understand. For in the star is written the story of how the worlds were made and set in place. The Prophet Joseph Smith has told us that:
The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God.

Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand them? Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who has seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power (D&C 88:45-47).
In this time and in this place may we be comforted by the symbol of eternal patterns which the stars reveal, and let us rest assured that more knowledge will be given us in that time and place which God has set for our knowing.
Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! And thou sayest, How doth God know? Can he judge through the dark clouds? Thick clouds are a covering to him . . . and he walketh in the circuit of heaven (Job 22:12-14).

Priscilla L. Evans and Florence G. Smith Released from the General Board

It is with keen regret and with an appreciation for the fine work done by Priscilla L. Evans and Florence G. Smith on the general board of Relief Society, that the general board has accepted the requests made by these sisters that they be released. Sister Evans' resignation became effective as of October 15, 1948, and Sister Smith's on October 20, 1948.

Sister Evans was appointed to the general board in June 1941 during the administration of President Amy Brown Lyman. She came endowed with unusual creative ability and was qualified by training to give outstanding service in matters pertaining to legal questions. From her previous position as mission Relief Society president of the Eastern States Mission she also brought to her position an understanding of Relief Society work, with particular insight into the needs and requirements of mission Relief Societies. She has fulfilled the manifold requirements devolving upon her as a member of the general board with distinction. Sister Evans will be long remembered as the creator and writer of the March 1947 Sunday night Radio Society program "A Story in Granite and Bronze," as well as for her co-operation in writing and impressive delivery of "From the Shadow of a Dream to the Sunlight of Promise" which recognized the stakes and missions in the Building Fund Program at the recent annual general Relief Society conference. She has also served Relief Society members and friends and recognition for herself and the organization during the past nine years through holding the position of corresponding secretary of the National Council of Women.

While Sister Evans has found it advisable to be relieved of the pressing and exacting duties of general board work, she will no doubt continue to give freely of her great ability and talents, as she may be called upon, both to her Church and State to which she has always been so generous in rendering outstanding service in the past.

SISTER Florence G. Smith was called to the general board in November 1946 during the administration of President Belle S. Spafford. She brought to her general board duties an understanding of Relief Society work growing out of many years' experience in presiding over the Relief Societies of the South African, California, and Northwestern States Missions. This service has made Sister Smith very cognizant of the differing conditions under which Relief Society functions in various parts of the world. In carrying out her general board assignment, she has manifested a willingness to serve and an appreciation of the opportunity to serve, coupled with a gentleness of spirit and a love for the women of the Church. Her services will remain to bless Relief Society.

She has now been called to serve as matron of the Bee Hive House for young women, an appointment which will be quite exacting but to which she will bring her wholehearted attention and splendid gifts of graciousness.

In Memoriam�Alice Merrill Horne

ALICE MERRILL HORNE, beloved member of the Relief Society general board (1902-1916), passed away October 7, 1948, at the age of eighty. Through her mother Bathsheba Smith Merrill, Sister Horne was a granddaughter of George A. Smith (cousin of the Prophet Joseph and First Counselor to President Brigham Young) and Bathsheba W. Smith, a beautiful and gracious woman, fourth general president of Relief Society. President George Albert Smith is a cousin of Alice Merrill Horne.

Sister Horne was also blessed with a rich spiritual and intellectual heritage from her father, Clarence Merrill. Alice Merrill, wife of George W. Horne, was richly endowed with beauty and strength of mind and personality. Whatever her capable hands touched blossomed with enduring symmetry. She served her State as an active member of the Legislature and in numerous other positions of civic trust and responsibility.

Sister Horne's work on the general board covered a wide range of activities, including the chairmanship of the Public Health Committee which established a series of sanitary milk stations in Salt Lake City and accomplished many other reforms vital to the welfare of mothers and children. She traveled widely as a representative of Relief Society, attending the International Council of Women in Berlin in 1904 and the meetings of the National Council of Women in 1902 and 1909, the Worlds Fair in 1915, and many other meetings of importance.

In the field of art, Sister Horne rendered invaluable service. She made many beautiful designs for Relief Society programs, bulletins, and other publications. A series of lessons which she prepared was published under the title Devotees and Their Shrines, a Handbook of Utah Art (1914). The book was adopted as a text in the schools of Utah and has been widely read, still maintaining its place as a most inspiring reference book. The preface, a masterpiece in prose, expresses Sister Horne's life-long philosophy of accomplishment: "Every spirit which enters mortality comes stamped with infinity�with a power to reach out and grow illimitably.... Listen to the infinite of your soul when it calls."

A gifted artist herself, Sister Horne devoted much of her life to the encouragement and welfare of other artists. She supported all groups and individuals interested in poetry, music, and cultural development of every type. Her life was broad and beautiful; she lived fully and richly and helped all who knew her to partake of the same bounty. She leaves an able and gifted family, two sons who are doctors, and three talented and lovely daughters, who are carrying forward much of their mother's unfinished work.

Alice Merrill Horne will be long remembered for her kind nursing of the sick, her innumerable kindnesses as a neighbor, and her untiring devotion as a friend. Many remember her precious guardianship of pioneer ideals and skills. She will also be remembered as a woman richly endowed who gave liberally of all that she possessed.

Relief Society women who attended the annual general Relief Society conference, held just prior to Sister Horne's death, will remember her as she sat on the stand as an honored woman who had labored long and faithfully for the advancement of Relief Society work in all its many phases—a woman of whom we all may well be proud and appreciative that she has lived among us.

New Serial to Begin in January

THE first chapter of "Joanna," a new serial by Margery Stockseth Stewart, will begin in the January issue of the Relief Society Magazine. 'The story relates the courageous efforts of a young widow to give her four children the best in life. The character portrayal is excellent, and the entire story is beautifully written. The author is the wife of Russell Stewart and the mother of two children. She is of Norwegian descent and has received a Citizenship Award from the Salt Lake City Junior Chamber of Commerce given for outstanding accomplishments of descendants of foreign-born Americans. A gifted writer of both stories and poetry, Mrs. Stewart has won many prizes. In 1946 her story "The Return" placed first in the Relief Society Short Story Contest. Many of her poems have appeared in the Magazine, including several frontispiece poems. Mrs. Stewart is a member of several literary organizations: the League of Utah Writers, the Barnacles (a Salt Lake City story-writing group), and she recently organized a chapter of the National Writers' Club. Her Church work has been varied, with service in dramatics in the M.I.A., being particularly outstanding.

WINTER

Alice R. Rich

North wind, like unleashed fury, comes from bare and sodden hills,
And sapless, naked trees and shrubs creak with its biting chills;
Gray, lumbering clouds roll ominously, without turmoil or sound,
Then loose their mist to spread a skirt of crystals on the ground.

Aprons for Christmas

Alice Willardson

IT seems only yesterday that we had our annual "Day with Longfellow." I mean the day we spend each fall in the canyon. We sit on a hillside in the warm sunshine absorbing the quiet and glorious color while we take turns in reading Longfellow's poems. It has become a sort of personal holiday to keep the autumn from slipping past us.

This year the maple leaves were so colorful that with the sunlight on them they actually seemed to give off light and warmth like fire, fire which does not leap and fade but remains steadily brilliant. I am glad, too, for the pine boughs and the cedar berries, for today the sky is gray and the wind is furious. Dead leaves are blown carelessly against the windowpanes; the fire in the fireplace feels good. The smell of the pine boughs burning in the grate is so pungent that I can close my eyes and see the Christmas tree. I can see all the gifts and wrappings scattered everywhere and hear all the happy noises and excitement. It won't be long till Christmas! You know!

This year I think I'll have an apron Christmas! This morning the sewing room looks very cozy and inviting. And just last week I heard Vina say she didn't have a single good apron. She likes one that is big and serviceable. Kate likes them to be sort of pretty and serviceable, too. I have a pattern with a ruffle on the shoulders, pinafore style, that will give it a festive appearance. She likes red, too, and it will sort of go with her kitchen. Anne always loves yellow and I have those scraps of flowered dimity which will combine with either white or yellow organdy beautifully.

That's one thing about giving aprons; they can be so individual. And they are within the pocketbook of the giver and always welcomed by the receiver. There are so many styles, colors, and materials—aprons for all occasions and all ages. Apron styles like those in illustrations No. 1 and No. 2 will cover your whole dress from danger of splashings. Made from percale, and minus the ruffles, they will be very practical. If made from dimity, they wear exceptionally well, too, and are so pretty to protect your nice dress while you serve the Sunday dinner. With the ruffles, or a touch of applique, they are pretty as well as serviceable. Notice the back in picture No. 2.

If you are tired of washing and untangling apron strings, this button back is very neat and effective. And if you want to save ironing, leave off the ruffles and just trim with braid, bias tape, or a combination material. There are many other styles for anyone who wants an apron to really work in, one that covers the dress completely. Wrap-around styles are the handiest and most useful aprons for the busy housewife.

Next, there are all the lovely little serving aprons—aprons as pretty and dainty as flowers. These can be No. 4 made from lawn, dimity, organdy, dotted Swiss (and by the way, if you want a very fragile, dainty looking apron that will really stand many washings, you can't beat dotted Swiss). There are three pictures of serving aprons illustrated here, Nos. 3, 4, and 5, which can be made from combinations of materials. They allow you to use scraps of quite a variety of shapes and sizes. Often when you have to use your own ingenuity to make something of the material you already have on hand, the result is much prettier than if you had bought special material and used a commercial pattern. A combination of materials is usually prettier than just one material, and you can use old aprons for cutting patterns for new ones.

No. 6

APRON No. 6 gives a suggestion for using applique trimming to form the pocket. Applique is used also to trim No. 7. An excellent idea for getting flowers, fruit, etc., for your applique work is to cut them out from some of the many colorful materials with large and distinct designs.

Aprons may be effectively trimmed with ruffles of self material (as illustrated in No. 8) or they may be accented with ruffles of a contrasting color. A very lovely decorative apron was made from white organdy as illustrated in No. 9. Colorful flowers cut from percale were inserted under the hem. The hem was turned over the flowers and fastened down on the right side by a dainty featherstitch. The same motif was also sewed under the organdy pocket. The flowers under the organdy not only made the work less inclined to ravel, and more easily ironed, but they also gave it a sort of ethereal, fairylike touch so suitable to organdy.

No. 10

There are no gifts more acceptable to both mothers and daughters than the lovely pinafores illustrated in No. 10. Make the "daughter" apron out of material just like mother's.

There are all types of trimmings, too. Braids and laces of all kinds are on the market now. There are all kinds of handwork, from blanket or featherstitching to lovely embroidery done in silk.

And, if you feel so inclined, there are now available fabric paints which are suitable and absolutely washfast. I have a painted tea towel which washes right along with my dish towels regularly.

If you are looking for something really different, there are all the aprons for special work, like clothespin aprons and sewing aprons. I even got an idea for a man's apron the other day as I watched my son priming the car. Why not make an apron of heavy, waterproof material, containing pockets for the sponge, the cleaner, the wax, the chamois, etc.? Might save a lot of hunting for them. This apron could be hung in the basement after it was used and it would be ready for use again the next time, complete with all the equipment.

Maybe I'm planning a gift that would be more welcomed by the man than by my gift that way, it's an idea!

Questing Lights
Belle Watson Anderson

CHAPTER 8 (Conclusion)

When a Scotchman really makes up his mind, things begin to happen. That's why Margaret was just hanging up the curtains in the cabin when the Missionary walked in.

"Andrew!" She hopped down from the ladder. "We weren't expecting you so soon. How did you manage it?"

Andrew spoke impetuously, "Margaret, when a man's in love, he says to the whole world, 'Step aside, and let me pass!' Well, here I am! Nothing will ever stop me if you are willing, Margaret, could you learn to love me?"

"Learn to love you?" Margaret stood silent for 4 minutes, then laughed joyously. "You see, man, I am far ahead of you. Like Rachel of old, I have waited seven long years for this, with not the encouragement she received, either," her face grew grave as she relived the years in her thoughts.

"You mean—Oh! Margaret, it is unbelievable." He took her tenderly in his arms and kissed her. "Darling, I will spend a lifetime to say I'm grateful."

The bairns outside heard voices and came in on the run.

"If only mother could see her bairns today, she wouldna' worry," Andrew prophesied. "Margaret, how can I pay you?"

"I love the bairns, Andrew." He took them all in his arms together. "Oh! You are all so marvelous. What a homecoming! I'm a very happy man."

If Andrew had put time and effort into his Missionary work, Margaret had been just as busy in the care of the bairns and the wool. In Tooele she had been thrifty and saved her money. She loved to work in the soft, fine, white wool, and to the cards, she had added a spinning wheel and a loom for weaving carpet and tugs. She had even purchased a jig for knitting socks and stockings. She looked forward to owning a home of her own someday on the millrace, where she would install a large loom for weaving cloth.

Linsey-woolsey was very popular. The loom could be rigged to a water wheel in the big creek. Many bats of many hanks of yarn, white and beautiful colors, for knitting, carpets, come out when she had too much to do, Kathleen and Mother had helped her. So the loom clicked and clattered, and the spinning wheel hummed and away the hours while Andrew had been away preaching the gospel.

In the cabin Margaret had also put glass in the windows, changed the mud roof for homemade shingles, laid carpet on the floors, and planted many roses and walnut trees around the home. At once, by Margaret had also put glass in the windows, changed the mud roof for homemade shingles, laid carpet on the floors, and planted many roses and walnut trees around the home.

ANDREW wanted to be married at once, but Margaret wanted a beautiful wedding. At the store when they could not pay her in cash, she got many yards of lovely material, and sometimes whole bolts of lace. She wanted some bonny and dainty things for herself and for her home.

In Scotland the girls began early to make and plan their trousseaux. Kathleen and Mother were wonderful sewers, and with their help, they all could have beautiful dresses, and she could have some lovely things for her home. So she left the spinning room in the cabin for a sewing room at Mother's for a time.

They baked a wedding cake, fruit puddings, and shortbread, everything that was essential for a very wonderful wedding. And while they worked they talked.

Kathleen and Mother told Margaret of the time when Andrew had raised grain on the river bottoms and timbered in the forest and that when he received word of Jane's marriage he hadn't gone back to the fields or to the forest.

"Yes, he was hard hit for a time, my darling, but his mission has cured him of all that," Mother said.

Margaret remembered the "Jane look," as she had called it on the plains when Andrew would sit for a long time and look far beyond the camp. She had known he was dreaming of Jane. That was all passed now; she did not need to worry about Jane. Margaret knew now that Andrew loved her. Yes, Andrew loved her but why did he not go back to the land and to the forest? The wool was her job. Andrew's was the harvest and grain. She thought of a plan.

She was curious, and wanted to go to the river bottoms with Andrew Rumgay. She suggested to him that they take a horseback ride the next Saturday afternoon. She was tired of being shut up in the sewing room; she wanted to get out in the sunshine.

Andrew thought it was a wonderful idea, so he brought Gypsy and Pinto up to Mother's for their ride.

They slowly walked their horses to the canyon. Resplendence was beautiful at this time of year. A tapestry in every tone and color of the autumn had been hung from the ceiling of the mountains. Farther up in the hills, vesper campfires were bright burning. The river sang low, sacred melodies for the rituals of the harvest time.

They tied their horses to some maple brush and walked into the great silent woodlands. Higher up in the mountains they heard the loud crash of falling trees and the wild cry of timber.

"The more trees that come down in the forest the more homes go up in the valleys. Many people are coming to the mountains to find homes every year, Margaret. They must find them. Soon I must return to the forests."

They walked back to their horses, mounted, and when they reached the river road Margaret touched the reins with her quirt, and they were off to a gallop towards the bottoms. At the crossing they reined their horses. Margaret was off Pinto in a jiffy. They stood almost speechless in the beauty of the valley and listened to the wild singing of the stream. They found a boulder on the edge of the creek and sat down.

ANDREW was particularly interested in the songs of the stream. He smiled.

Can you imagine anything so far-fetched as to interpret these very happy roundelays of music into weird and solemn dirges?
"Oh, it's so peaceful here. Wouldn't it be wonderful to live out here? You could farm and I could card wool. When you harvested I could bind and gather the sheaves."
"When the Indians become more friendly, Margaret, we will build our home in the bottoms." Andrew arose and led Margaret to the fields. The one hundred sixty acres had been raised on some of it this year. He picked up some of the fine black soil, pressed it in his hands, and slowly let it fall back to mother earth.
"I am like my kinsmen in Scotland, Margaret. I would like to own some land."
Margaret gave a big sigh of relief. "We will find other fields, darling, and build greater harvests. The bottoms have wonderful dreams of home, wife, and children. Margaret, life will be so complete."
The young lady looked up and smiled. "Brother Rumgay, did I remember to tell you that I love you, and I think you are wonderful?" She put her arms around him and kissed him. "Name our wedding day, Andrew, and I will make arrangements to be there."
On their way home Andrew spoke seriously. "Margaret, we have treasure on our land, but we will never hang on the wall or place on the mantel." They walked into the plains one day.
"They are more precious than the crown jewels of Scotland. Mother has her rocks, the sage, ginger tea, even the catnip. Then what comes, Margaret?"
"Her prayers and faith, Andrew. I know that my Redeemer liveth."
"With such a wife, darling, I know I cannot fail." They planned to be married as soon as arrangements could be carried out. They would take two covered wagons for the wedding trip to the temple, and all the Macs, and this time the bairns.
One afternoon Andrew left his wagon up at Mother Mac's, for the women to pack everything they would need on the trip. They expected to leave at five the next morning. In the evening he went along to see that everything was ready. Bob was just putting in the wagon box the table and benches he had chopped to build fires.
"What, no Bob to build the fires?" Andrew asked.
"Mother is taking everything we used on the plains--tents, camp kettles, dishes, bedding, and this time we have a lantern."
"Mother says we are just now finishing up the trek, attending to the business that should have been taken care of years ago."
"Your mother has something there, Bob. Why didn't she mention it to me? How are the boxes? Mine are full. I can trust your mother."
"Well, that part won't be just like the plains," Bob gratefully admitted.
The Macs had planned to hold a reception at Mother's when they returned, but the people of the ward had taken things over. The meetinghouse was decorated, and the sisters had cooked a big wedding supper at the Hunters. They had baked other wedding cakes, as one would not be enough for everyone in town to have a piece. After the supper there was a wonderful program, and at the last Brother Huntcraft had a few words to say to Andrew and Margaret.
"I'll only keep you a few minutes. I know you all want to dance. I'd like to find a word Angus started. Andrew, a few years ago you and I picked out some land on the river bottoms.
"Well, after you left on your mission, the people decided that since you were so willing to go into the world and represent us, they would like to do something for you. Tonight we are giving you back the one hundred and sixty acres, all paid for, and nearly all broken up. And this is just one of the many wedding presents the people of Resplendence are giving to you tomorrow night, Brother and Sister Rumgay. A long and happy married life!"
Andrew felt he had the world in his arms when the Lord gave him Margaret. Now, with the land, and the many gifts his friends had showered upon them, he was amazed.
They called for a speech, and Andrew stood up. "Brothers and Sisters, my heart is too full for expression tonight. When a man has the gospel, a wife, home, land, beautiful gifts, and kind friends, no words can express his appreciation. I hope through my life and the rest of my life to prove to the Lord, and to you, how grateful I really am. Thanks a lot, folks."
At the end of the party they passed the wedding cake. Everyone called for a dance by the Macs. The orchestra began playing "Annie Laurie." Brother Coleman danced with Mother Mac, Bob chose Helen Hunter who was just about a Mac.
Margaret was beautiful in her white wedding gown and long veil of white, soft lace, which she had made, sewing yard after yard, upon row until it was long enough to fall into the full, rippling folds of her dress. She wore a wreath of white satin rosebuds with blue and ivory centers. Her corsage and bouquet were of white and pink lady slippers combined with blue sisters.
Kathleen was lovely in a beautiful shade of yellow. Mother, with the softest of blue hair, was very bonny in pale lavender. Janet, the little flower girl, wore pink.
The strains of the romantic music of "Annie Laurie" were changed to the sweet rhythm of "Home, Sweet Home." Everyone took partners and joined the Macs in the last dance. The music was sacred, the theme divine, as the bridal couple kept time to its beautiful melody.
"I love the cabin down on the millrace, Margaret," Andrew spoke softly.
"I have learned to love it too."
They danced a few measures, and Margaret added, "And the bairns."
Andrew waited breathlessly until Margaret spoke. "And you, too." 

Christmas Presents Can Be Different
Elizabeth Williamson

Side from the personalized gifts you will select for your family and close friends this Christmas, there are two other groups you may want to consider—your neighbors, and the people who seem to have everything. Well, who can resist good food, especially if it appeals to someone's special taste and is packaged attractively? Here are some suggestions for the people who have everything:

Page 826

Small cheeses, wrapped in bright cellophane, and attached to an evergreen branch
Packaged caviar
Spreads and relishes
Imported hors d'oeuvres
Homemade jams or jellies

If you are famous among your friends for making an unusual cake, or specializing in Christmas plum puddings, or confections, you may want to give one of these. Dates stuffed with fondant seem to be a favorite of everyone. These, wrapped in bright Christmas papers or colored tin foils, are attractive and tempting.

If your friend who has everything lives in an apartment, she will especially appreciate food. Perhaps some of your home-canned fruits, jellies, or pickles will be very welcome. You may give vegetables from your own garden, such as dried onions, potatoes, or squash.

Packaged fresh fruit, containing oranges, lemons, or grapefruit, with a liberal sprinkling of nuts, is another idea. Put these (fruits or vegetables) in large containers which can be used later. For example, use a wastepaper basket full of assorted fruit, or a magazine rack containing squash and onions. Dish drainers, lettuce drainers, or anything which appeals to your imagination can be used.

Your close neighbors very likely will have the same type of garden, grow the same vegetables, and make the same jams and jellies you do, so perhaps the food suggested above 827 will not serve as a very exciting gift for them, but don't you think freshly baked Christmas pastry, or a big crunchy breakfast cake, dotted with nuts and maraschino cherries, will appeal to them for their Christmas breakfast? Individual plum puddings, a mincemeat pie, fruitcakes, will be gratefully received. Your neighbor will be very pleased to know that you haven't forgotten her during the rush of the holiday season.

Christmas Letter
Grace Rushton Squire in the real sense of the word, Christmas means more to a mother than it means to anyone else.
That means more than a mother? It commemorates the birth of the Savior, and who knows just what lies in the hearts of all mothers as a sacred knowledge of the reality for which Christ truly stands—the birth of a little Babe. The spirit of that Babe of Bethlehem dwells in every mother's heart and acts as a focus which at Christmas time, when hearts are softened with the spirit of giving, draws closer the bond of kindred hearts, which the cares, pleasures, and sorrows of this world are continually striving to break.
At this season of the year, when the earth is wrapped in a sheet of white, when trees are bare and nature is lying asleep, the heart is turned to the spiritual and moral. The call is for in her family lie her hopes, joys, and ambitions. The mother's heart is then calling her family—the family circle that is where her heart is calling.

Sister Ann Jane Killpack, President, North Central States Relief Society, reports that the sisters of the Williston Branch have been blessed abundantly for their willingness to serve and have found great joy in doing so. Under the able direction of President Anne Bean, the principal goal of this group has been to support the Welfare program to their utmost.
"Already on the way to Europe," Sister Killpack reports, "are five large and five small quilts, ten baby blankets, seventeen kimonas, and two dozen pairs of mittens. The mittens are exceptionally outstanding as they were all made from old winter coats, then lined with flannel, and reinforced with the tops of men's socks to hold them tight at the wrists. Thus they are warm, resisting both the rain and the snow. Along with these were sent boxes of made-over garments."

The setting was inspired from the cantata "Messengers of Mercy" by Gladys Rich, and fifteen events were pictured in a large frame, showing the progress of Relief Society from the beginning to the present day. Each ward participated in the arrangement of the scenes which were depicted with musical accompaniment. A lovely reception followed the pageant.

South Los Angeles Stake (California) Entertains Relief Society Members Over Seventy
Approximately 450 guests attended this delightful social honoring the forty-two members of the stake Relief Societies who are over seventy years old. Especially honored was Sister Mary Rockwood (inset), ninety years of age, who has been a secretary in Relief Society for more than twenty-five years. As an infant she was brought across the plains to Utah in a covered wagon. As a young woman she was an officer in the Retrenchment Society and also delivered copies of the Woman's Exponent from door to door, to save postage for mailing that pioneer publication.
"The mother of ten children, Sister Rockwood experienced the hard work and trials connected with rearing a large family under pioneer conditions. She made soap, candles, quilts, carpets, and clothing; she dried fruit, took care of a garden, sat up with the sick, and helped to prepare the dead for burial. Sister Rockwood now lives in Huntington Park Ward with her daughter Laura Stephens.

832 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1948 "Lean Your Ear This Way" (Continued from page 807) finger, not "'aside of his nose," but in the familiar, self-conscious gesture of pushing back his hair, for just the split second before he recollected that some of his hair simply could not bear pushing back. Unmistakable, the familiar young hand on the pudgy old body! She could almost see the willing-to-please expression behind that puffy, round smile. Wanting to laugh almost as much as she wanted to cry, Adele remained for the rest of the conversation. "You won't be seeing me on Christmas Eve, boys, but I'll be seeing you," concluded Santa Claus.

AS the boys moved out of earshot, Adele stepped forward. "Isn't it about time for your lunch, Santa?" she inquired. "I beg your pardon, madam," Roy said. Then, noticing the giveaway in the tone of his voice, despite his effort to disguise it, he added ruefully, "I might have known you'd find me out. I admit it's more than lunch time. Just wait a second, while I change coats, and I'll take you out for a sandwich."

"I have to talk to a saleswoman upstairs," said Adele. "Tl attend to that while I wait. But, Roy, whatever happened at Freem's, you should have told me." "Nothing spectacular happened at F'reem's," he stated simply. "Just the unexpected return from Tokyo of one Major Dickson, an expert assistant manager, with honorable discharge papers in good order, and considerably more than a murmur ailing his heart. I would have told you, if I hadn't known that I could keep us in the income class by Santa Clausing until Christmas and helping with the pre-inventory sale here until the new year. And after that I have the promise of helping out with income tax returns at the State Capitol. In my spare time I'll continue to haunt the employment agency, in the hope of getting something really good lined up again."

"And I know you will," reassured Adele.

The beauty of it was, she felt, that she actually did know that he would. It might be ridiculous, but, after all, it was traditional to feel just this warmly confident when one walked beside that bulky, redclad figure. All the while she had worried so about wherever Roy could be, he had been fully competent to take care of his share in their partnership.

Conscious that Roy was still talking as he led her toward the back of the store, Adele centered her attention on his words. "I certainly wasn't going to tell you about this stunt until afterward. I'm glad it doesn't strike you as being too rugged. But, once I get a real job lined up again, no more of this Santa Claus gag for me!"

"T wasn't going to tell you, either," said Adele, and the merriment in her eyes became something that was deeper.

"But, 'Lean your ear this way,' Saint Nicholas! No matter how good a job you line up—from this year on, you'll have to count on assuming the role of Santa Claus, permanently."

LIVING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD 833 Living to Enjoy the Blessings of the Lord (Continued from page 800) before you, in the not far distant future, the possibility of a building, a women's building, erected by the generosity and self-sacrifice and faith and devotion of the women of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that will be the equal, I am sure, of any building that women use in all the world as a women's building. So I congratulate you on your possibilities, on your probabilities, because I think in the not far distant future, if the world will come to its senses, if they will stop quarreling with one another, people will stop fighting one another and do more praying and less fussing, I think we can begin the erection of our building for the Relief Society that will not only give joy to you who are particularly interested, but all the rest of us will be happy that you have it.

We have been doing a lot of repairing of one kind and another, been working on this organ, making that a little better than it was before, that is, we hope we have. I have not been listening to it lately, but I am assuming that it is very 'much improved, and when they get it finished I am sure we will all be happy. But think what it means. Here you are. You have come into this greatest of all houses of worship. "There is not anything else like it, no other house in the world with a dome like this, no other house in the world that has the acoustics that this building has, and in this building we have one of the loveliest organs that anybody has in all the world. And wonderful choirs sing here. The voices of our Father's sons and daughters are heard here. It does seem to me when we sing if we would just appreciate how good he has been to us, it ought to be the easiest thing in the world to sing his praises while we are here in this marvelous building.

Blessings of Saints As I look over the audience I see the children and the children's children of some of those who were pioneers, came into this valley in an early day, and they came here with the word of the Lord in their hands. They not only had the Old and the New Testament, the Holy Bible, but they brought with them the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and other scriptures, all that the world has in the way of true scripture we have, plus a lot of other scripture that the world has not had until the Lord gave it to us. Surely we are not unmindful of all these things.

And when I think of the beautiful block that we are on here, and the flowers and the shrubs and the trees, the glorious sunshine that we enjoy here in this part of the world, and all of the blessings that God has bestowed upon us in such a rich way, and our homes, I am extremely grateful. Do you realize that when the people came into this valley, a little over one hundred and one years ago, there was not a house that a human being could live in? Now look at it. Lovely homes, lovely churches, streets, conveniences of almost every kind you can think of.

I cannot think
of a convenience that is important in all the world that we do not have
right here in this valley that a hundred and one years ago was a desert.
And when President Brigham Young looked over this valley and said: 'This is the place,' I can imagine that there were people in that group of 143 men, three women, and two children, who thought he must be dreaming. They could not imagine that this could be the place the Lord wanted them to settle.
But it was, and see what has happened.
And now, people come from all parts of the world to see what has been accomplished here in the last hundred years. Hardly a week passes that somebody does not come into the office who has never been here before and says, "This is one of the most beautiful cities as you have here."
Promises to the Righteous
Now, all the blessings that have come to us, brothers and sisters, are the result of keeping the commandments of God. All these blessings are not the result of our willfulness, our carelessness, or our indifference, but they are the result of honoring God and keeping his commandments, and there have been enough of our people who have saved the day for the rest.
You will remember in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, when Abraham pleaded for two great cities that they be not destroyed because the people were so wicked, and when he asked: "Why would you not destroy the righteous people who are there in those cities," and the heavenly personage said to him: "No, not if there are enough of them."
Then Abraham began to plead. "If there are fifty people in those two great cities can they all be saved?"
"Yes."
"Forty?"
"Yes."
"Thirty?"
"Yes."
"Twenty?"
"Yes."
"Ten?"
Yes.
That is how precious righteous people are. Let us not forget that.
If there had been ten righteous people in those two great cities, and they were populous cities, the fire would not have come down from heaven to destroy them, but they would have had another chance.
Now, think of what we have here. Think of the righteous men and women that live in the community that you live in, and they are righteous. They are not perfect. I do not know any perfect people, but I have known some that it seemed to me were just as near perfect as it was possible to be. That is what the Lord has promised. If you seek first, not last, but seek his kingdom and his righteousness and all other things will be added that are worthwhile. That is what he means.
And think what we have. Think of the peace and quiet enjoyed here today and in some parts of the world bombs may be dropped any moment, guns may begin firing at any time. Why? Because the difference being, here we are trying to do what our Heavenly Father would like us to do and there, many of them are doing what they know they should not do.
Now, my brethren and sisters, and particularly the sisters, because you are the majority in this great audience today by far, I congratulate you. I congratulate you on belonging to the finest organization in all the world, officered, managed, and planned and carried on by women. There is not anything else like it, and I hope that you will keep in mind the suggestion of one of your sisters today to look after those who are not taking advantage of their opportunities. Do a little missionary work wherever you are and encourage others to do the same thing, and instead of having a few thousand people who are willing to do what the Lord wants them to do and make every effort to do that, there will be millions of people who are influenced to keep the commandments of God and stay the destruction that the Lord has said will come upon the earth unless the people repent of their sins and turn to him. He has already assured us that it will take repentance.
I would not like to sound a discordant note here, nor cause anybody to begin to worry because of the destruction that may come, but I can say this that the Lord has promised you in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that if you will seek first his kingdom, that all desirable things will be added. That means the undesirable things will be stayed and your homes will be the abiding place of peace and thanksgiving and gratitude to God, and mothers and fathers will love one another and work together in rearing their families. Parents will cherish their children and bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and children will be taught to honor father and mother with the assurance that their days may be long in the land that the Lord our God gives unto us.
Gratitude for Hospitality
I have just touched upon a few of the things that the Lord has promised to us and to all people who will accept him and his advice. I think it is marvelous. I want to take this occasion to thank you, good women living in different parts of the country, who have taken care of us who are General Authorities of the Church as we have traveled through the country; we have been in your homes. You have fed us; you have given us places where we could be made comfortable, and in many cases you and your husbands have carried us on our way. I am grateful to you for the kindness that I have received.
It has been marvelous to me how many times I have been in a position where I needed real help, and it has come as a result of good women and good men in the community where I happened to be.
Now, coming back to the building, I wish we could tell you right now when it can be started. I wish we could tell you just when a number of them could be started. We are needing buildings for the Church in so many cases. We were in need of over four hundred houses of worship and structures to be used by the Church a year ago, and it may interest you to know that over two hundred of them are already finished or are in the course of completion.
Half of them, but there are yet another two hundred and more, and in so many cases where two communities or three use the same house for worship, in due time each will have its own house and its place of recreation, and all will meet together as brothers and sisters under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord.
How wonderful it is to have that influence. Come into this building when there is not a soul here and close your eyes and I think you will feel like others have.

Time after time people have said there seems to be an influence here that I have never felt any place else. There should be. There should be an influence in this building that people can feel because the Lord has promised that his Spirit will abide in these places that have been dedicated to him as long as we treat them as we ought to. I congratulate you. I wish I had words to express my appreciation for what you are doing, what has been done by those who have preceded you and for what your daughters who are coming along will do even after you are gone. What an opportunity the Lord has blessed us with, to give us the fulness of the earth in these marvelous mountain vales, and all the advantages and opportunities of the civilization of our day, plus the testimony that burns in the souls of hundreds of thousands of people that we are the children of God and we know it, and if we are righteous, may remain close to him throughout the ages of eternity. I congratulate the leadership of this great organization, your presidency and general board, the stake RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE DECEMBER 1948 officers, and the ward officers. If you could get them all together this block would not hold them, to say nothing of this building. They are a great army of women and when you realize that at one time ten righteous people could have saved Sodom and Gomorrah from destruction, think what an influence you have, think what power you have in this world if you are recorded among those who are righteous, honoring God and keeping his commandments. It will not be long before disaster will come to the earth. It will not be very long before this earth will be cleansed and purified by fire and become the celestial kingdom, but in the meantime, the Lord has given to us the opportunity to go forward, rear our families, develop our homes, prepare our institutions of learning and all the advantages, under the influence of the same spirit, if we will, that will be here when our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, our Lord, will be here in person. Think what a wonderful thing it is! That is the preparation for it, that is why these commandments were given and the other commandments of the Lord, not to prevent us from happiness, but to add to our joy and our comfort and our satisfaction, day by day, while we go forward looking to the time when we will be with those whom we love forever. As I stand here today I realize it may not be long until the summons reaches me. When it comes I will pass out of the picture here in mortality, but when that time comes I am looking forward to meeting the dear ones that have preceded me, those who have gone before. And LIVING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD there are many of them on the other side that have gone through the experiences of mortal life, have lived true and faithfully and devotedly, so that our Heavenly Father has promised them they may return to earth as celestial beings and dwell here throughout the ages of eternity. That is what these books are for. That is why the Lord gives us so much information that we refer to as scripture. It is not that we may have food and clothing and houses and lands here. That is only a part of it. It is that day by day we may so adjust our lives that we will become more perfect as the years go by, rear our families to be more perfect. That is the purpose of it all, in order that all may be saved in the celestial kingdom and have the companionship of those who are dear to us, forever. Relief Society for All the Sisters That is what this great organization you belong to was instituted for. It was not just to make quilts. It was not just to go from door to door and ask people to make a contribution to your fund. That was only a part of it. The Relief Society of this Church was organized that all of the daughters of our Heavenly Father, I say all of them, because it was intended that they should, those who are worthy should be identified with the Relief Society of the Church, and that each one should not only be a member but that each should be a faithful, devoted daughter of the Lord, working in that organization of Relief Society for the blessing of all your sisters. What an influence you have in the world, and how much more influence can be had if you can persuade your sisters in the communities in which you live, that are not doing anything particular in preparation for eternal life in the celestial kingdom, to come into the fold and begin work. I have been talking about the sisters, inferring that there are some women that are not yet doing all they should in the Church, but I would like to say to the two or three or half a dozen brethren that are here, we have a whole group of men in the Church whom unless we can get the sisters to help us, I do not think we will get very far with. We have men in the Church who have grown up in it, who do not even hold the Priesthood and we have others who ought to hold the Melchizedek Priesthood who only hold the Aaronic Priesthood, hundreds of them, and if they die under those circumstances they may lose their opportunity of eternal life in the celestial kingdom, and they are your brothers and husbands and fathers, in some cases. I do not mean you who are sitting here, but I mean the women, husbands and fathers and brothers, these men, and we need to do teamwork, and we need to set our homes in order. If our sisters would only encourage their husbands to do their part, visiting in the wards in which they live as ward teachers, trying to draw the men in that have not done just what they should, and then the women would go out and do their share, encouraging the women to come in. Do you realize what the Lord has said? What matters it though you spend your whole life here upon earth, performing the duties incident to mortality, spend your whole life, and during that time the result of your effort is the salvation of one soul, and that your own? He said you shall have great joy in our Father's kingdom with that soul. We all have something to do, and I congratulate you on what you have done.

No other group of women in all the world has compared with what you have done in the way of blessing mankind, rearing your families and devoting yourselves unselfishly to bringing peace and happiness to those that were in distress, and because of that, the Lord loves you, and he is anxious that you should have every advantage and every blessing, and he will give it to you just as fast as you are worthy. I am grateful to be here with you today. I thank these sisters who invited me to come and visit with you, and I want to be among those who will be permitted to come into your new building when it is completed. I hope that it may be kept so sweet and clean and wholesome and beautiful and delightful that the Spirit of the Lord will find comfort there. That is what I hope it to be, and I trust that that will be in the not far distant future. I wish I could tell you just where it could be located. I wish I knew, but it will not be far away from the Temple. It will not be far away from the Tabernacle, and I want to say to you it will not be very far away from the Lord, and that is the important part. So keep smiling, keep working, keep planning, and praying. Remember your sisters in the old world, millions of them, who have comparatively no comforts. In twenty-four hours they could not enjoy the peace that you have here in five minutes in this RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE DECEMBER 1948 building today, wherever they are, and they are your sisters. We have over five thousand missionaries in the world endeavoring to bring the peace and happiness that you have to our Father's other sons and daughters. A good many of those in the world are women. There was a time when our sisters did not go into the world very much as missionaries. There was a time when some of the mission presidents did not think they could do missionary work very well, it was so difficult, but if you would see some of the letters that are written in from mission presidents now, "Cannot you send us some of those fine women that can do such splendid work among the women and among the children in these lands?" There is a way. It is coming. In the not far distant future there will be more missionaries out. If we will just keep the standard of liberty and of righteousness floating here in our homeland, keeping our homes in order, husbands faithful and devoted to wives, and wives faithful and devoted to husbands, parents to children, children to parents, neighbors to neighbors, remembering that the second great commandment referred to in this wonderful volume by the Savior of the world was: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." If we did that how wonderful it would be to go from house to house and from village to village and find dwelling in every heart the Spirit of God burning there in a luminous, delightful way, filling the soul with happiness and peace and comfort and satisfaction and knowing that that will endure forever. I pray that the Lord will bless LIVING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD these presiding officers, the general officers, the stake officers, the ward officers, all these who have responsibility, and oh, let your light so shine that others seeing your good works will be constrained to glorify the name of our Heavenly Father. We are his children. This is a part of his family that is gathered here today. How wonderful it is to know that he is not far from us, that he is all-powerful, and has promised us that if trouble comes, if necessary he will come down in heaven, not from heaven, he will bring heaven with him upon this earth and fight our battles and preserve us, and we will go on living throughout the ages of eternity. That is the promise of our Heavenly Father.

| Again, I thank you for your kindness to me and to my associates as we travel in your communities, your kindness to all those who need you, your kindness to those people who live across the great and mighty ocean. I do not know whether you have been told, but probably you have, one hundred and twelve carloads, each car the capacity of forty tons, a hundred and twelve carloads of food and bedding and clothing have been shipped across the ocean 839 since the war to feed and make comfortable your other brothers and sisters, some of whom have not yet come into the Church. That has been your contribution. How many quilts did you have? We have had in total about nine thousand. My goodness! Just about two months from now you will wake up some morning, somebody has left the window open and the fire has gone out and you will wish you had just one more quilt, and then realize that the organization that you belong to, in that one item—that is only one item—over nine thousand handmade, homemade, quilts have been made by your organization, and then you have asked for the privilege of giving them, not selling them 'of giving them to our Father's other children that they may be, in part at least, as comfortable as you are. God bless you for your faith and your devotion and your fine work. Keep your homes in order. Keep the adversary away. Live so that the Spirit of God will be with you all the time, and I can say to you that if you will do that you will be happy all the time and that you may so be, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ONE LONE STAR
Dorothy J. Roberts

I shall be there; I must return
Tonight when one lone star will burn
Across the acres of the world.
Before its last faint gleam is furled
I shall follow the camel's hoof;
See winter silver on the roof;
And set my heart attune to hear—
Despite the centuries—one clear Hosanna,
Filtered though it be, coming from hilltops far from me.

I shall breathe the scent of myrrh
Blent by the kneeling worshipper;
And behold the jewels spread
Beside one on his humble bed.
With all the hungering hosts of men,
I shall partake of peace again.
Before the waning year is spent
I shall return for sacrament.

Effective Choral Organization
Florence Jepperson Madsen
Member, Relief Society General Board

Just as the piano and organ are built to produce balanced volume when chords are played, so should a singing group be organized to produce a tonal balance when engaged in part singing. Therefore, when effecting a singing organization, careful attention should be given in choosing the proper number and type of voices for the various parts. Thus, for example, in a chorus of fifty trained singers the division should be about as follows: twenty first sopranos, sixteen second sopranos, and fourteen altos.

In organizations made up of both trained and untrained singers, or of untrained singers entirely, the proportion of distribution necessarily varies. One may be able to sing the soprano part in a mixed chorus with comparative ease and still be unable to sustain the highest part in a women's chorus without effort and strain. This is due to the fact that in a women's chorus there are two and often three voices singing below the soprano, necessitating constant singing on higher pitch levels; while, in a mixed chorus, there is but the one treble voice (alto) below the soprano, therefore, generally requiring a more normal range of voice. In classifying and distributing membership care should be exercised, especially in relation to the sopranos so that only those who can sustain high tones easily should be selected for this part. Thus it is seen that those who are chosen to sing the first soprano part should possess voices of the high, lyric type. Such classification not only conduces to better tone quality but also to more accuracy in pitch. One loud, strained voice can upset the pitch of an entire group. When not enough high sopranos are available to balance the other parts of a chorus, it is advisable to choose songs which the moderately high soprano voices can sing with ease. It is often necessary to strengthen the second soprano part. This is easily done by having a number of the medium high sopranos assist. However, different members should be chosen for different songs, thus giving more sopranos experience in singing inner parts.

'The value of such experience is emphasized by Robert Schumann in the following statement: "Sing frequently in choruses, especially on the middle parts. This makes you musical." MUSIC C. Cameron Johns

This is the universal tongue;
The soft diapason speaks to every heart,
In simple terms that each may understand.
There is no Babel
Where the searching fingers of melody
Explore the labyrinth of sound.
In the might roll and ebb of notes
The organ speaks to the earth-bound
With the voice of God.

Theology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior
Lesson 14—"A Period of Darkening Opposition"
Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 22, by Elder James E. Talmage)

For Tuesday, March 1, 1949

Objective: To acquaint class members with the events of the Savior's life during the time he was preparing the apostles for their final great responsibilities.

Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ.

Our Lord had spent two years in the great work of his ministry during which he had received considerable popular acclaim. The plain people heard him gladly. There was a turning against him that boded ill during the third year. That was the sifting period when those who really believed would be separated from the "lukewarm" and those who were openly opposed. Spies had been watching him closely both in Galilee and Jerusalem.

Ceremonial Washings
"And Many Such Like Things"

Jesus began detailed instructions to the apostles. He wanted them to be prepared to carry on after his foreknown death. They were yet to make a great change in discarding the rabbinical forms and ceremonies of the Jews and to go wholly to the plain, but glorious requirements of the gospel of the kingdom.

Already, with the approval of the Lord, they had so far transgressed "the tradition of the elders" as to omit the practice of ceremonial cleansing of hands before eating. They were ignoring customs that had become rabbinical laws. It should be remembered that "the offense charged against the disciples was that of ceremonial uncleanliness, not physical uncleanliness or disregard of sanitary propriety." Not because they had soiled hands, were they criticized, but because they did not perform the ceremony.

When this criticism was made, Jesus replied by asking a question, "Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?" He called them hypocrites and cited Isaiah's prophecy, "... This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me" (Mark 7:6). To prove his accusation he cited the commandment of God, "Honor thy father and thy mother." Moses had even proclaimed death to him "that curseth his father, or his mother" (Ex. 21:17), The law requiring a son to assist needy parents had been so changed

that a wicked or ungrateful son could escape responsibility by declaring a thing required by parents to be "corban," something intended as a gift to God. (Read Mark 7:11.) The undutiful son had a lifetime to make the gift. In other words, these unauthorized changes made the word of God noneffective. "They were straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel."

In this day the members of the Church are taught the same fundamental law of honoring one's father and mother and caring for one's relatives. A fundamental concept of the great Church Welfare Plan is to provide for one's own. Present-day Church leaders have pointed out, quoting words of the Savior, the duty of children to parents, of husband to wife, of parents to children, concerning adult children, and the position of widows, orphans, and the poor.

No Church member in this day can excuse himself as not having been taught to care for his own insofar as it is possible to do so (See "Fundamentals of the Church Welfare Plan," Pres. J. Reuben Clark, Jr., General Conference, October 6, 1944).

Leaving those who were trying to trap him, Jesus called the people together and taught them a great truth:

. . . Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear (Mark 7:14-16).

This announcement came in direct conflict with the rabbinical teachings of the day. The Pharisees took offense. Their rule was not only to wash the hands but also to clean them by ritual. Jesus explained that the food taken into the body remained only for a time. It was that which came from the mouth which defiled. Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts and all manner of crimes. "As we think, so we are."

There was to be no compromise between the teachings of the Lord and corrupt Judaism. Jesus could only state his doctrine and let the consequences follow. When principle is involved, there can be no compromise.

Within the Borders of Tyre and Sidon
Jesus, evidently seeking seclusion where he might instruct the Twelve, decided to go north into the country known as Phoenicia. But, in the language of one of the disciples, his presence "could not be hid." There were people in the region of Tyre and Sidon who had heard him speak and knew of his fame. The Canaanites were held in particular disrepute. However, one woman of that tribe came to the Master and said, ". . .

Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil." By the manner of her address she clearly showed her faith in the Messiah. She continued her pleadings until the disciples asked him to send her away. Her earnest cry, "... Lord, help me," and the faith and persistence she manifested, touched the Savior and he said unto her, ". . . O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour" (Matt. 15:22-28). (It is recommended that class members read also Mark 7:24-30.) 

Some wonder why the Lord delayed granting the request of the woman. Well, we do not always know God's ways. We do know that the woman's faith was proved and it was a great lesson to the disciples. The blessings of the Christ were for all who had faith. They were not to be confined to the children of Israel. After Jesus left Tyre and Sidon, he traveled for some days among people who were not Jews. Wherever he went he healed the lame, blind, and maimed. When they saw the mighty works, the gentiles glorified the God of Israel. In one particular instance, the people asked the Lord to lay his hands upon a man who was deaf and defective in speech. Jesus led the man away from the crowd, then put his hands in the man's ears and touched his tongue. "And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain" (Mark 7:35).

Another Meal in the Desert

On this trip Jesus again fed a large group of people—four thousand men, besides the women and children. These people were hungry and away from home. The disciples had only seven loaves and a few little fishes but the people were fed abundantly, as in the case of the prior miracle. (Read Matt. 15:32-38.)

Again Beset by Sign-Seekers

When he could not find seclusion elsewhere, the Lord took his disciples for another trip on the Sea of Galilee and gave them some profound instructions. He warned them against the false attitude and doctrines of the Pharisees and Sadducees. These two ordinarily discordant parties were united in their opposition to the truth. So often that is found. The most frequent trick of the adversary is to ask for a sign. When these wicked people asked Jesus for a sign he refused with a sharp rebuke: "A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas" (Matt. 16:1-4).

"Thou Art the Christ"

The writer of these lessons has purposely cut short the consideration of other topics in this chapter to give somewhat detailed study to one particular incident recorded in chapter 16 of Matthew. "When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?" Mark well the question which was really the subject of the conversation. He wanted them to know once and for all who he was. They reported to him the rumors, "Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets." The people seemed to have no intimation that he was the Messiah. In the eyes of the people he had not measured up to their expectations of a great deliverer and king. To many, signs had been given, but he had rejected their offer to crown him king of Israel.

Then to the Twelve, to whom had been given special training and preparation, he propounded the question, "But whom say ye that I am?" Peter answered for the group, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." That was a solemn testimony—a positive knowledge. "And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven." Then Jesus added, "And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:13-18).

Did he mean that he was going to build his church upon Peter or any other man? The Lord was referring to his own Church. Was it then to be given to a man? No, that would make it man's church. "Through direct revelation from God, Peter knew that Jesus was the Christ; and upon revelation, as a rock of secure foundation, the Church of Christ was to be built." A Church built upon that revelation is secure as a rock and the powers or "gates of hell" can never prevail against it as long as it is so led and guided. With due respect, any church built upon Peter would be Peter's church and not the Church of Jesus Christ. By revelation alone can his Church be builded and maintained.

Reference is made to Matthew 16:19. "And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." These keys were authority to act for God. They were given to the Twelve Apostles. What church upon the earth today claims authority for its presidency and apostleship to bind on earth and it shall be bound in heaven? Did the Lord give useless keys that were not to be used? The answer can only be given in the negative. To the Church of Jesus Christ in this day have been given the same keys of authority as are being used almost every day in the temples of God.

Questions and Suggestions

Discussion
1. Discuss the changes the rabbis had made in the law: "Honour thy father and thy mother."
2. Relate the incident of the healing of the daughter of the woman of Canaan.
3. Discuss the promise of the Lord that he would build his Church upon the rock of revelation.

Bend closer, angels
Alice Money Bailey

This is the moment when heaven touches earth—
Time and eternity are one at birth.
Bend closer, angels, let me hear your singing,
Tune your choir to my heart's deep ringing.
Stars lean near me, lease your slender light;
Lean and bless; I am one with you tonight.
Come, dawn, softly. Breathe across the hills,
Loose all the joy that a bird's throat spills.
Burst high, morning! Break wide, day!
Shine where new lambs dance and leap at their play,
Smile through my window, rest on my bed.
The curve of my arm holds a wee, silken head.

Visiting Teachers Messages—Our Savior Speaks
Lesson 6—"Ye Cannot Serve God and Mammon"
Elder H. Wayne Driggs

For Tuesday, March 1, 1949
Objective: To emphasize that the allurements of the world do not provide lasting happiness.

No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other" (Matthew 6:24). In this statement, from the Sermon on the Mount, our Savior was warning against setting our hearts too much upon material wealth and worldly possessions. "For," he declared, "where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matt. 6:21). Does this mean that we must forego pleasure in the good things of earth? No, for we are told that:...

The earth is man's and the fulness thereof... Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart; yea, for food and for raiment... And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess (D. & C. 59:18-20).

Note those concluding words: "to be used with judgment, not to excess." Is ours not an age of excess? As the poet Wordsworth phrased it, "The world is too much with us; late and soon, getting and spending, we lay waste our powers." If we are not careful, the worldly attractions in life can become so all-absorbing that we may fill our days with things of little worth. At such times we are in danger of losing the power to discern what constitutes true values.

In seeking to gain more and more of material things we are apt to become covetous. Against this sin the Savior warned: "Take heed, and be ware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth" (Luke 12:15). Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal (Matt. 6:19-20).

"Ye cannot serve God and mammon" (Matthew 6:24).

LESSON DEPARTMENT:. 847 Work Meeting Sewing
(A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)

Lesson 6 Blouses and Slips

Jean Ridges Jennings

For Tuesday, March 8, 1949

We mentioned in a previous lesson that men wear out shirts in strategic points long before the whole of the article has passed its usefulness. The same thing is true of women's blouses. They get generally shabby or the sleeves pull out. But the front section, which is the attractive part of the blouse, outlasts the garment as a whole. We also find this is often true of nice lingerie. The part that takes the rub goes, and we often have the embroidery and ruffles left in good condition.

Neckline accessories may be made from the odds and ends cut away from old blouses and lingerie. The smallest bit of lace can be renewed by squeezing it in soap suds, rinsing well and wrapping it, while wet, around a glass or bottle, pressing it out to full dimensions with the fingers and allowing it to dry and stiffen.

If necessary small pieces may be joined carefully by hand, following the pattern of the lace so the join will not show. These may then be used as edgings for collars or cuffs or inserts on collars or vestees.

Usable collar and cuffs or collar and vestee sets may be made from the good parts of blouses and trimmed with refurbished pieces of lace or embroidery. Collars can be cut to follow the neckline of the dress and the designs varied into square or rounded styles.

The front of an old blouse might be used intact as a vestee by cutting away underarm sections and sleeves, binding or hemming the edges, and holding it around the waistline with a tape sewed to the binding.

Pieces of ruffling or embroidery could be very ingeniously used as bows, ruffles or rosettes to be placed at the side of a neckline or elsewhere as lingerie touches to brighten up a drab dress. Oftentimes blouses that have been discarded by a grownup can be cut down into smaller sizes for young girls, thus eliminating the worn parts under the arms and around the sleeves, but still giving service.

In many cases there will be plenty of good material that can be salvaged from a slip when it is worn out as far as adult use is concerned to make a small girl a good serviceable slip. Add a touch of beading at the top of the ruffle with a ribbon drawn through it and a tiny bow, and the "small fry" who falls heir to it will be proud as a peacock.

Also, the good parts of these nice slips could easily be made into panties to be worn for "Sunday best" by the younger generation.

Literature of the Gospel Restoration Lesson 6 Lyric Expression of the Restoration Elder Howard R. Driggs

For Tuesday, March 15, 1949

A truly religious song is an overflow of the soul. When the heart gets "so full that a drop over fills it," lyric expression affords emotional relief. Singing has therefore ever been, except with extremely Puritan-minded folk, closely linked with religion.

The children of Israel let out their hearts in song. Thus came their soulful psalms and other lyrics. In later years when Christianity was first being spread among the folk of Europe, the carols, vibrant with love for the Savior, were created to bring continuing joy and uplift for all.

The psalms and carols may be called lyrics because they are an outpouring of great emotion—of praise and thanksgiving. The lyric is a poem which has the quality of music. It is a "form of musical utterance in words governed by emotion and set free by a harmonious rhythm."

Didactic poetry differs, in that it is instructive in nature or teaches a moral lesson.

Lyric poetry as distinguished from either didactic, epic, or dramatic, is expressive of the poet's feelings rather than of outward incident or events. There are certain laws of lyric form. One of them is the law of brevity. It is impossible to keep the lyric pitch for very long. The rapture turns to pain.

There is also the law of unity. Too, the lyric vocabulary should not seem studied or consciously ornate for that breaks the law of spontaneity.

Naturally, with the spiritual rejoicing inspired by the restoration, the impulse was to sing praises to the Lord.

Our Prophet was even given a revelation voicing divine approval of such lyric expression, in these beautiful words: "For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads." In the same revelation the Prophet's wife, Emma, was assigned the "selection of sacred hymns, as it shall be given thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church." With such heavenly sanction and guidance at the beginning, the Latter-day Saints were encouraged in making song and music an intrinsic part of their worship. At the outset, of course, there were no songs written by members of the Church. They could use only those created by others in accord with the spirit of the restored gospel. Within a few years, however, springing largely out of the missionary work, songs began to appear, a few of them set to music of earlier creation. Some of the hymns of high nonsectarian cast were found inspiring and helpful, and adopted. Some of these which are still sung are: "O God, Our Help" (From the Wesley Collection); "God Moves in a Mysterious Way," by Cowper; "Joy to the World," and "Sweet Is the Work," by Isaac Watts. Lyric lines from such hymns are akin to the psalms in soul-lifting quality.

To illustrate: O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Our shelter from the stormy blast, And our eternal home. God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform; He plants his footsteps in the sea, And rides upon the storm.

Note the majesty and strength in these simple lines, just given. Feel also the spiritual lift of the following lines: Joy to the world! The Lord will come And earth receive her King: Let every heart prepare Him room, And saints and angels sing. Latter-day Saints, in common with other God-loving folk, could sing with responsive hearts such songs.

There was need, however, for something even closer to the meaning and spirit of the newly restored gospel for the satisfaction of their inmost need. Nor was this something long in coming. Again we turn to Parley P. Pratt as a pioneer in the creation of distinctively Latter-day Saint hymns. In his Voice of Warning, which, as has been said, is poetic prose, he occasionally would express his thoughts in verse, as he did at the opening of his section on the Book of Mormon: Lo! From the opening heavens, in bright array, An angel comes—to earth he bends his way; Reveals to man, in power, as at the first, The fulness of the Gospel long since lost.

It was not long before this missionary poet was also creating hymns of classic cast—songs still dear to our people, and often sung. They are vibrant with the spirit of the restoration—and filled with truth. For example: The morning breaks, the shadows flee; Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled, The dawning of a brighter day Majestic rises on the world.

The above stirring lines and others in the hymn, set to music by another master, George Careless, as well as those that follow from the inspired pen of Parley P. Pratt, rank with the finest of religious lyrics: Come, O Thou King of Kings, We've waited long for thee, With healing in Thy wings, To set Thy people free.... Come, make an end to sin, And cleanse the earth by fire, And righteousness bring in, That saints may tune the lyre....

No need is here to quote at length from the songs which have become so much a part of us. Mere giving of an opening line will set a Latter-day Saint congregation ready to sing the hymns dear to our hearts. And sing they must to get the full beauty of the lyric lines. Singing is just a more beautiful way of reading. Through a song one lingers on expressive words.

Yet this also should be remembered: One can sing a song soulfully only when one can read the song aloud expressively. Try it.

As the epic rise of the Church continued, lyrics expressive of the emotional high points of the restoration naturally were created.
Many songs are the heart throbs of history, created when feeling was high, or during ecstatic remembrance of stirring events. An example of the latter is the loved lyric, "Joseph Smith's First Prayer," written in after years by George Manwaring.

Sweet sincerity, beautiful pictures, and an impressive message are in its rhythmic lines, a few of which follow:
O how lovely was the morning Radiant beamed the sun above. Bees were humming, sweet birds singing, Music ringing through the grove. When within the shady woodland Joseph sought the God of love. Suddenly a light descended Brighter far than noon-day sun And a shining, glorious pillar O'er him fell, around him shone While appeared two heavenly beings, God the Father and the Son.

"An Angel from on High," of earlier creation, by Parley P. Pratt, sings of another event of deep significance, in such lines as these:
An angel from on high, the long, long silence broke; Descending from the sky These gracious words he spoke: "Lo, in Cumorah's lonely hill, a Sacred record lies concealed; Sealed by Moroni's hand. It has for ages To wait the Lord's command. From dust to speak again.

Still another, created by one of the great song writers of the Church, William W. Phelps, just after the martyrdom, keeps Joseph Smith in vivid, sacred remembrance, with flaming lyric lines, expressive of courage and prophetic. The opening stanza and the chorus of this classic song follow:
Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah! Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer, Blessed to open the last dispensation; Kings shall extol Him and nations revere. Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven! Traitors and tyrants now fight him in vain; Mingling with Gods, he can plan for his defense Death cannot conquer the hero again.

Another splendid hymn by William W. Phelps, vibrant with the spirit of the restoration, begins with these lifting lines:
The Spirit of God like a fire is burning! The latter-day glory begins to come forth; The visions and blessings of old are returning, And angels are coming to visit the earth. We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb. Let glory to them in the highest be given Henceforth and forever; amen and amen!

Readers of this lesson will probably recognize that a dominant characteristic of these earlier expressions is a distinctive lyric quality. Little didacticism or sermonizing is in the lines. The lyrics mentioned above sing the gospel of the latter days. Its light and truth newly revealed brought joy and gladness. In them one feels the conviction of the poet in the reality that God lives and Jesus is the Christ.

Out of the lengthened years of darkness, doubt, dissension among the multiplying creeds, God again had spoken; his Son Jesus Christ had come again in person to re-establish his work in purity, simplicity, and power on the earth. Those of poetic skill expressed these truths with fervor and devotion. In doing so they left us all a rich heritage of lyric literature.

LESSON DEPARTMENT

Nor was it men alone who voiced with true emotion, with beauty and clarity, the feelings and thoughts that lifted their souls. Gifted women of the Church likewise created lyrics. Among these was Eliza R. Snow, whose life links with not only the period of the restoration but with the stirring years that followed. One of the most loved of her poems is "O My Father—a prayer perfect—in its artistry of lyric expression." It carries also one of the sweetest, most divine tributes to mothers ever expressed.

I had learned to call Thee Father, thro' Thy spirit from on high; But until the Key of Knowledge was restored, I knew not why. In the heav'ns are parents single? No; the thought makes reason stare. Truth is reason, truth eternal tells me I've a mother there. When I leave this frail existence, when I lay this mortal by, Father, Mother, may I meet you in your royal courts on high?

Then, at length, when I've completed all Thou sent me forth to do, With your mutual approbation, let me come and dwell with you.

Here is precious truth given under inspiration for not only Latter-day Saints but for all the world. In this brief study, we have been able only to open the door to treasures. It is hoped that those who participate in the lesson will be intrigued to search for and enjoy more of the songs that make the restoration live again.

Indeed, the members of the Relief Society have been doing just this through the years. May the writer, with this closing word, pay tribute to those of this great organization who chose the Relief Society Songs. This hymnal, if such it may be called, contains a precious selection of uplifting religious lyrics. Congratulations also are due this splendid society for the forward-looking creation of the "Singing Mothers." It is an inspirational example for all the world.

Studies and Activities

1. A. What is a lyric? How does it differ from didactic poetry?
B. Why may the psalms and the carols generally be classified as lyrics?

2. What are the characteristics of the earlier lyrics or songs created by members of our Church? Illustrate.

3. Make a brief comparative study of "Come, O Thou King of Kings," by Parley P. Pratt, and "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning," by W. W. Phelps. In what basic respect are they alike? How do they differ?

4. Discuss briefly the statement that "singing is a more beautiful way of reading." Take some stanza of a song; as, "O My Father"; "Jesus Once of Humble Birth"; "Joseph Smith's First Prayer," "Praise to the Man"; "Rest, Rest on the Hillside, Rest"; or another of your choice, read it aloud, then sing it, noting the difference.

5. Be ready to join with the class in expressive singing of some song that expresses the joy of the restoration of the gospel.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—DECEMBER 1948

Social Science—Latter-day Saint Political Thought
Lesson 5—Main Currents in Latter-day Saint Political Thought as Revealed in Discourse and Literature
Elder G. Homer Durham

For Tuesday, March 22, 1949

By some of the early Church leaders.

EVAN JENSEN

The doctrines of the Christian religion are the foundation stones of Latter-day Saint political thinking. Translated into the terminology of political philosophy, the following appear to be basic:

1. The State and government are essential.
2. The State must recognize man as a child of God and so respect human liberty. Religious freedom is not only essential to man's nature as a child of God, but is the means whereby eternal truth can be made available to men in society, who can then provide the basis for a healthy State and good government.

4. The government of God is fundamentally limited in that it will not interfere with human liberty—on pain of ceasing to be Godly—and governments in their operations should recognize a similar limitation.

5. The Constitution of the United States partakes of divine inspiration because it recognizes the above principle, and thus serves as a model for all governments.

In, through, and around these more or less basic postulates, are many rich expressions in the literature of Latter-day Saint political thought.

Sidney Rigdon (1793-1876)

Prominently identified with the rise of Mormonism was Sidney Rigdon. The "Lectures on Faith," for many years printed in editions of the Doctrine and Covenants, constitute his principal contribution to Latter-day Saint literature. For notation here, however, attention is called to a discourse of July 4, 1838, at Far West, Missouri, sometimes styled by Joseph Smith as a Mormon "declaration of independence." Copies of the speech were printed in pamphlet form and are today very rare. In 1941 a San Francisco bookseller was holding a copy for sale at $800.

The speech was uttered in the midst of the Missouri persecutions. It sets forth the right of resistance when liberty is infringed. The Latter-day Saint answer to the deep problem of political thought is thus suggested: When is violence, if ever, justified? Rigdon's statement is perhaps the most fiery, radical statement in Latter-day Saint thought and can only be understood in relation to the trials and sufferings of the driven, persecuted saints.

Remember it then, all men. We will never be the aggressors; we will infringe on the rights of no people, but shall stand for our own until death...

And the mob that comes on us to disturb us, there shall be between us and them a war of extermination... (Whitney's History of Utah, I, page 144; see B. H. Roberts, Missouri Persecutions, page 193, for a complete quotation).

Parley Parker Pratt (1807-1857)

Perhaps one of the most romantic figures among the early saints, aside from Joseph Smith, was Parley Parker Pratt, who joined the Church in August 1830. In 1837, in vigorous prose, Pratt produced The Voice of Warning, probably Mormonism's oldest, most famous tract. Chapter three of this work is devoted to an enlarged explanation of the kingdom of God idea, viewing the restored Church as God's "organized government on the earth." The Voice of Warning is easily available and excerpts from chapter three can readily be examined.

Brigham Young (1800-1877) Brigham Young, that great empire builder whose stature grows with the years, has yet to be recognized, as he some day will be, for his deep philosophic insight. A beginning was made in 1937 when Professors Gabriel, Warfel, and Williams of Yale University included Brigham Young's views on government in their anthology, The American Mind. (See also Discourses of Brigham Young, chapter 31, "Political Government." ) Quite outstanding among President Young's many statements bordering on the subject of political philosophy, is his discourse on "The Kingdom of God," July 8, 1855. (Journal of Discourses II, 309-317). Here is the stated ideal of the great, tolerant, Christian world society towards which Church and State should strive in their "co-ordinate" capacity, and in which one need not be a Christian so long as he respects the rights of others. When the Kingdom of God is fully set up and established on the face of the earth... It will protect the people in the enjoyment of all their rights, no matter what they believe, what they profess, or what they worship. If they wish to worship a God of their own workmanship, instead of the true and living God, all right, if they will mind their own business and let other people alone... That Kingdom grows out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but it is not the Church, for a man may be a legislator in that Body which will issue laws... And still not belong to the Church of Jesus Christ at all.

John Taylor (1808-1887) The third president of the Church produced a work concerning which Hubert Howe Bancroft wrote: As a dissertation on a general and abstract subject, it probably has not its equal in point of ability within the whole range of Mormon literature (History of Utah, page 433). This was The Government of God (Liverpool: 1851). President Taylor faced some of the most severe political problems of the Church. Book Five of The Gospel Kingdom (pp. 297-349), published in 1943, contains the choice selections of his thought in many matters ranging from world problems, to the Latter-day Saint position with regard to the American nation, socialism, and other movements. In 1855, while publishing a weekly newspaper, The Mormon, in New York City, John Taylor wrote, for example, the following: We believe that our fathers were inspired to write the Constitution of the United States, and that it is an instrument, full, lucid, and comprehensive.... That it is the great bulwark of American liberty and that the strict and implicit observance of which is the only safeguard of this mighty nation. We believe that the president, governors, judges, and governmental officers ought to be respected, honored, and sustained in their stations but that they ought to use their positions and power, not for political emolument, or party purposes, but for the administration of justice, and equity, and for the well being and happiness of the people (The Gospel Kingdom, pp. 309-310).

Wilford Woodruff (1807-1898) President Wilford Woodruff inherited—and solved—the great political problems thrust on the Latter-day Saints during President Taylor's administration, many of them going back to 1830. In so doing, Latter-day Saint thought is indebted to President Woodruff for one of the most clarifying concepts we have concerning Church-State relationships and the problem of the "kingdom of God" therein. In answer to a public question, "What is the Mormon idea of its rule as the Kingdom of God?" President Woodruff replied, in harmony with the Latter-day Saint "co-ordinate" theory of fundamental limits—for human liberty's sake—on both Church and State: It is this: we hold that this Church was set up and organized by command of the Almighty; that it has the right to formulate and maintain rules of church discipline applying to its own members; that the extent of its punitive power is the excommunication of the transgressor; that it has no power to punish anyone by deprivation of life, liberty or property or personal injury in any form; that governments should not regulate the church, nor the church seek to control the state; that all men should be politically free and equal to vote as they please and to sustain what politics they please, so that they do not infringe on the rights of others (The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, 1946, page 193. An important "Official Declaration" of December 12, 1889, pp. 193-195, preceded the above statement).

The presidents of the Church who have followed: Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, Heber J. Grant, and George Albert Smith, have continued, with others, to expound and develop the Latter-day Saint contribution to the more adequate political theory that scholars, statesmen, and modern men seek. Problems of war, peace, labor relations, industrial strife, and social organization have all been discussed and gospel solutions therefor suggested by modern Church leaders.

Questions for Discussion 1. In America and England, the Society of Friends (or Quakers), have attracted world-wide attention because they refuse to bear arms. American and English law, accordingly, has recognized their rights as "conscientious objectors" to war. When, if ever, is the use of force justified? On what basis can Sidney Rigdon's address of July 4, 1838, be understood? The participation of thousands of boys and some girls belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the armed services?

2. Chapter 9, in President Heber J. Grant's book of compiled discourses, Gospel Standards, is entitled, "Government and Public Affairs." Class leaders might examine this chapter as well as chapter 21, "Political Government" in the Discourses of Brigham Young for source material.

3. Discuss Brigham Young's statement that a man may be a legislator in the kingdom of God "and still not belong to the Church of Jesus Christ at all."

4. How does the above statement relate to the quotation given from President Wilford Woodruff in this lesson?

The Presidency a unit

George QO. Cannon
President John Taylor

At Milnthorpe, Westmoreland, England, on November 1, 1808, a child was born in humble surroundings whose influence as a stalwart defender of religious truth, was destined to be felt in Canada, the United States, and the continent of Europe before his life closed seventy-nine years later. John Taylor was his name and he became the third President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Born into a Church of England family, he was discontented with its theology and sought for more vital religion. When about fifteen years of age he joined the Methodist Church and was soon functioning as a local exhorter. About 1828 he emigrated to the New World and within a year John Taylor Joseph F. Smith or two had established himself in Toronto, Canada, as a local Methodist preacher. He was a wood turner and made his living at this trade.

It was not long, however, until he became dissatisfied with Methodism. He was an assiduous reader and had an analytical mind. His treading and thinking showed him how far Methodism was removed from the gospel of the New Testament Church, and so he withdrew from the Methodist organization, taking a large following with him, and formed with them a study group for the purpose of discovering the true Biblical teachings concerning the fundamentals of Christianity. They came to be known as "Dissenters."

At this time a new sect known as the "Irvingites" was making LESSON DEPARTMENT claim that God had called a prophet and that the Primitive Church was again formed upon the earth. John Taylor was attracted to this movement but soon saw its inadequacy and withdrew from it, continuing his search for the true Church.

It was at this critical time in his life that Parley P. Pratt arrived in Toronto. He traveled as did the ancient apostles "without purse or scrip," depending upon God to direct him to the honest in heart. Elder Pratt began holding meetings and among those who attended were John Taylor and his wife. "John wrote down eight sermons which Apostle Pratt preached," says B. H. Roberts, "and compared them with the scripture." He also investigated the evidences of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. "I made a regular business of it for three weeks," John relates, "and followed Brother Parley from place to place."

The result of this thorough investigation was that John Taylor and his wife, Leonora Cannon Taylor, were baptized on May 9, 1836, by Elder Pratt. Elder Taylor became a staunch supporter of the Prophet Joseph. He was called to the apostleship by revelation on July 8, 1838, and thus began a career of Church leadership that was to continue for forty-nine years.

-At Nauvoo he was editor of the Church weekly, the Nauvoo Neighbor and also for a time of the monthly periodical Times and Seasons (a semi-monthly publication after the first year). In these capacities he became intimately associated with Joseph Smith and grew to love him with a bond that was stronger than any fear of death. He voluntarily accompanied Joseph Smith to Carthage jail and the Prophet's last hours in mortality, indeed his very last hour, were soothed and comforted by the tender and wholesome spirit and loving friendship of John Taylor.

During the attack in which the Prophet lost his life, Elder Taylor received four musket balls in his body, one of which he carried with him to the grave. As a member of the Council of the Twelve he did extensive missionary work, opening Ireland, France, and Germany to the preaching of the gospel: and supervising the translation of the Book of Mormon into French and German.

At the death of Brigham Young in 1877, John Taylor was senior member of the Council of The Twelve and by virtue of this office, presided over the Church during the apostolic presidency which lasted until 1880. In October of the latter year the First Presidency was reorganized and he was sustained as President of the Church, with George Q. Cannon (whom he had converted in England in 1840) and Joseph F. Smith (later to become the sixth President of the Church) as his counselors. This Presidency served the Church until 1887.

This decade from 1877 to 1887 was a trying one, filled with a series of vexatious crusades and troublesome political struggles carried on by enemies of the Church against the Church in the Territory of Utah. The courage that President Taylor had manifested in the face of death in Carthage jail now guided him in his administration of Church affairs.

In addition to conducting the affairs of the Church at headquarters, he planned and directed the openings of the Mexican and Maori (New Zealand) missions; inaugurated the Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Upper Snake River Valley colonizations of the saints; planned the colonization of saints in Mexico and sent missionaries to labor among the Indians in Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Arizona.

It was during President Taylor's administration that the golden jubilee of the Church was celebrated, and in spite, of the persecution that was directed against the saints it was made a time of rejoicing.

Debts due the Perpetual Emigration Fund by poor saints were cancelled, as were overdue tithes; cattle, and sheep were distributed to the poor and the needy; and the Relief Society was called upon to assist in the good work for the benefit of the Church as a whole. The preceding year had been one of great drought and there was a scarcity of seed-wheat for the new crop. President Taylor suggested that the Relief Society sisters lend their 34,761 bushels of stored wheat— they had been accumulating it for years against a time of need—to the farmers, to be repaid without interest after the harvest. 'This was gladly done and proved to be of great benefit to all of the settlements.

President Taylor was a man of culture and refinement. He wrote as a gifted theologian and a profoundly religious philosopher. His literary writings, as well as his sermons, manifest a beautiful style. As recreation he wrote religious poetry and drama. His best known poems which have been set to music are the missionary hymn, "Go Ye Messengers of Glory," "The Glorious Plan," and "The Seer," in which latter he poured out his heart concerning his departed Prophet-leader.

Due to the crusade that was being waged against the Church, President Taylor was faced with the alternative of submitting to a prison sentence or retiring from the public eye. He chose the latter course and made no public appearance after February 1884. From his post in exile he directed the affairs of the Church to the best of his ability. The enforced separation from his family and his inability to get the exercise to which he was accustomed, undoubtedly shortened his life. He died in exile at Kaysville, Utah, on July 25, 1887.

God had guided this leader from his native England to the New World where the restored gospel awaited him, and then given him inspiration to guide the destinies of the kingdom. Of God on earth was George O. Cannon

George Q. Cannon, whom President Taylor chose to be his first counselor in 1880, was born in Liverpool, England in 1827, and was baptized by Elder Taylor in June 1840. Emigrating with his parents to Nauvoo in 1842, he went to live at the home of his uncle, Elder John Taylor, and until 1849 was considered a part of the Taylor household. At Nauvoo he learned the printing and publishing business under the tutelage of his uncle, and this skill proved of great worth to himself and the Church in later years.

He emigrated to Utah in 1847. "Bibles Since 1863 at Your Bookstore" "Better Living" Buy From YOUR DEALER Utah Power & Light Company

Brigham Young recognized in him a man of great ability both in temporal and spiritual matters, and he was called as a missionary to the Hawaiian Islands in 1850. He remained there until 1854 and during these four years was primarily instrumental in the conversion of about four thousand natives to the Church. He acquired great proficiency in the use of the Hawaiian language and translated The Book of Mormon into that tongue, and later at San Francisco, published this work.

He was ordained an apostle August 26, 1860, and left soon afterward for New York where he acted as immigration agent for the Church. In 1861 he established the first Church owned printing shop in England, and for many years this establishment was the chief publishing center for Church literature. While in charge of the British Mission between 1862 and 1864, he directed the emigration of upwards of 13,000 saints to America in especially chartered vessels. Charles Dickens visited one of these vessels before it sailed, to make a report on emigration, and saw President Cannon supervising and organizing the group for the voyage. He paid President Cannon and the Mormon emigrants some fine compliments in his article in Uncommercial Traveler.

President Cannon established the Juvenile Instructor (now The Instructor) in 1866, as a means of teaching the gospel to the youth of Zion. He devoted many years to the organization of the Sunday Schools in the Church and was a member of the Sunday School Union from its organization in 1867 until his death in 1901. A man of great speaking and reasoning ability, he was elected as territorial delegate to Congress for ten years and held numerous positions within the territorial government of Utah.

To President Cannon the Church is greatly indebted for the publishing of much of its literature. He encouraged many of the early converts to the Church and more recent ones to write their religious experiences for the benefit of the young people. These were subsequently published in the Juvenile Instructor and as pamphlets or booklets. As first counselor to John Taylor, he shared with his President the hardships of the persecutions of the 1880's and stood by him as a valiant assistant in managing the affairs of the Church.

Joseph F. Smith The second counselor of President John Taylor, Joseph F. Smith, was a son of Hyrum Smith, brother of the Prophet, and was born at Far West, Missouri, on November 13, 1838. He had spent a life of service for the Church at the time the call to the Presidency came in 1880. He had gone on his first mission at the age of fifteen to the Hawaiians and had been ordained an apostle in 1866.

A further account of his life and labors will appear in the following lesson and the one dealing with him as President of the Church.
