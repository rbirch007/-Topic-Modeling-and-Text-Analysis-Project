Main Currents in Latter-day Saint Political Thought as Revealed in Discourse and Literature
Elder G. Homer Durham

For Tuesday, March 22, 1949

By some of the early Church leaders.

EVAN JENSEN

The doctrines of the Christian religion are the foundation stones of Latter-day Saint political thinking. Translated into the terminology of political philosophy, the following appear to be basic:

1. The State and government are essential.
2. The State must recognize man as a child of God and so respect human liberty. Religious freedom is not only essential to man's nature as a child of God, but is the means whereby eternal truth can be made available to men in society, who can then provide the basis for a healthy State and good government.

4. The government of God is fundamentally limited in that it will not interfere with human liberty—on pain of ceasing to be Godly—and governments in their operations should recognize a similar limitation.

5. The Constitution of the United States partakes of divine inspiration because it recognizes the above principle, and thus serves as a model for all governments.

In, through, and around these more or less basic postulates, are many rich expressions in the literature of Latter-day Saint political thought.

Sidney Rigdon (1793-1876)

Prominently identified with the rise of Mormonism was Sidney Rigdon. The "Lectures on Faith," for many years printed in editions of the Doctrine and Covenants, constitute his principal contribution to Latter-day Saint literature. For notation here, however, attention is called to a discourse of July 4, 1838, at Far West, Missouri, sometimes styled by Joseph Smith as a Mormon "declaration of independence." Copies of the speech were printed in pamphlet form and are today very rare. In 1941 a San Francisco bookseller was holding a copy for sale at $800.

The speech was uttered in the midst of the Missouri persecutions. It sets forth the right of resistance when liberty is infringed. The Latter-day Saint answer to the deep problem of political thought is thus suggested: When is violence, if ever, justified? Rigdon's statement is perhaps the most fiery, radical statement in Latter-day Saint thought and can only be understood in relation to the trials and sufferings of the driven, persecuted saints.

Remember it then, all men. We will never be the aggressors; we will infringe on the rights of no people, but shall stand for our own until death...

And the mob that comes on us to disturb us, there shall be between us and them a war of extermination... (Whitney's History of Utah, I, page 144; see B. H. Roberts, Missouri Persecutions, page 193, for a complete quotation).

Parley Parker Pratt (1807-1857)

Perhaps one of the most romantic figures among the early saints, aside from Joseph Smith, was Parley Parker Pratt, who joined the Church in August 1830. In 1837, in vigorous prose, Pratt produced The Voice of Warning, probably Mormonism's oldest, most famous tract. Chapter three of this work is devoted to an enlarged explanation of the kingdom of God idea, viewing the restored Church as God's "organized government on the earth." The Voice of Warning is easily available and excerpts from chapter three can readily be examined.

Brigham Young (1800-1877) Brigham Young, that great empire builder whose stature grows with the years, has yet to be recognized, as he some day will be, for his deep philosophic insight. A beginning was made in 1937 when Professors Gabriel, Warfel, and Williams of Yale University included Brigham Young's views on government in their anthology, The American Mind. (See also Discourses of Brigham Young, chapter 31, "Political Government." ) Quite outstanding among President Young's many statements bordering on the subject of political philosophy, is his discourse on "The Kingdom of God," July 8, 1855. (Journal of Discourses II, 309-317). Here is the stated ideal of the great, tolerant, Christian world society towards which Church and State should strive in their "co-ordinate" capacity, and in which one need not be a Christian so long as he respects the rights of others. When the Kingdom of God is fully set up and established on the face of the earth... It will protect the people in the enjoyment of all their rights, no matter what they believe, what they profess, or what they worship. If they wish to worship a God of their own workmanship, instead of the true and living God, all right, if they will mind their own business and let other people alone... That Kingdom grows out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but it is not the Church, for a man may be a legislator in that Body which will issue laws... And still not belong to the Church of Jesus Christ at all.

John Taylor (1808-1887) The third president of the Church produced a work concerning which Hubert Howe Bancroft wrote: As a dissertation on a general and abstract subject, it probably has not its equal in point of ability within the whole range of Mormon literature (History of Utah, page 433). This was The Government of God (Liverpool: 1851). President Taylor faced some of the most severe political problems of the Church. Book Five of The Gospel Kingdom (pp. 297-349), published in 1943, contains the choice selections of his thought in many matters ranging from world problems, to the Latter-day Saint position with regard to the American nation, socialism, and other movements. In 1855, while publishing a weekly newspaper, The Mormon, in New York City, John Taylor wrote, for example, the following: We believe that our fathers were inspired to write the Constitution of the United States, and that it is an instrument, full, lucid, and comprehensive.... That it is the great bulwark of American liberty and that the strict and implicit observance of which is the only safeguard of this mighty nation. We believe that the president, governors, judges, and governmental officers ought to be respected, honored, and sustained in their stations but that they ought to use their positions and power, not for political emolument, or party purposes, but for the administration of justice, and equity, and for the well being and happiness of the people (The Gospel Kingdom, pp. 309-310).

Wilford Woodruff (1807-1898) President Wilford Woodruff inherited—and solved—the great political problems thrust on the Latter-day Saints during President Taylor's administration, many of them going back to 1830. In so doing, Latter-day Saint thought is indebted to President Woodruff for one of the most clarifying concepts we have concerning Church-State relationships and the problem of the "kingdom of God" therein. In answer to a public question, "What is the Mormon idea of its rule as the Kingdom of God?" President Woodruff replied, in harmony with the Latter-day Saint "co-ordinate" theory of fundamental limits—for human liberty's sake—on both Church and State: It is this: we hold that this Church was set up and organized by command of the Almighty; that it has the right to formulate and maintain rules of church discipline applying to its own members; that the extent of its punitive power is the excommunication of the transgressor; that it has no power to punish anyone by deprivation of life, liberty or property or personal injury in any form; that governments should not regulate the church, nor the church seek to control the state; that all men should be politically free and equal to vote as they please and to sustain what politics they please, so that they do not infringe on the rights of others (The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, 1946, page 193. An important "Official Declaration" of December 12, 1889, pp. 193-195, preceded the above statement).

The presidents of the Church who have followed: Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, Heber J. Grant, and George Albert Smith, have continued, with others, to expound and develop the Latter-day Saint contribution to the more adequate political theory that scholars, statesmen, and modern men seek. Problems of war, peace, labor relations, industrial strife, and social organization have all been discussed and gospel solutions therefor suggested by modern Church leaders.

Questions for Discussion 1. In America and England, the Society of Friends (or Quakers), have attracted world-wide attention because they refuse to bear arms. American and English law, accordingly, has recognized their rights as "conscientious objectors" to war. When, if ever, is the use of force justified? On what basis can Sidney Rigdon's address of July 4, 1838, be understood? The participation of thousands of boys and some girls belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the armed services?

2. Chapter 9, in President Heber J. Grant's book of compiled discourses, Gospel Standards, is entitled, "Government and Public Affairs." Class leaders might examine this chapter as well as chapter 21, "Political Government" in the Discourses of Brigham Young for source material.

3. Discuss Brigham Young's statement that a man may be a legislator in the kingdom of God "and still not belong to the Church of Jesus Christ at all."

4. How does the above statement relate to the quotation given from President Wilford Woodruff in this lesson?

Lesson 5�The Presidency of John Taylor
Elder T. Edgar Lyon
For Tuesday, March 22, 1949

The Presidency a unit
The three ARE ONE
George QO. Cannon
President John Taylor

At Milnthorpe, Westmoreland, England, on November 1, 1808, a child was born in humble surroundings whose influence as a stalwart defender of religious truth, was destined to be felt in Canada, the United States, and the continent of Europe before his life closed seventy-nine years later. John Taylor was his name and he became the third President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Born into a Church of England family, he was discontented with its theology and sought for more vital religion. When about fifteen years of age he joined the Methodist Church and was soon functioning as a local exhorter. About 1828 he emigrated to the New World and within a year John Taylor Joseph F. Smith or two had established himself in Toronto, Canada, as a local Methodist preacher. He was a wood turner and made his living at this trade.

It was not long, however, until he became dissatisfied with Methodism. He was an assiduous reader and had an analytical mind. His treading and thinking showed him how far Methodism was removed from the gospel of the New Testament Church, and so he withdrew from the Methodist organization, taking a large following with him, and formed with them a study group for the purpose of discovering the true Biblical teachings concerning the fundamentals of Christianity. They came to be known as "Dissenters."

At this time a new sect known as the "Irvingites" was making LESSON DEPARTMENT claim that God had called a prophet and that the Primitive Church was again formed upon the earth. John Taylor was attracted to this movement but soon saw its inadequacy and withdrew from it, continuing his search for the true Church.

It was at this critical time in his life that Parley P. Pratt arrived in Toronto. He traveled as did the ancient apostles "without purse or scrip," depending upon God to direct him to the honest in heart. Elder Pratt began holding meetings and among those who attended were John Taylor and his wife. "John wrote down eight sermons which Apostle Pratt preached," says B. H. Roberts, "and compared them with the scripture." He also investigated the evidences of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. "I made a regular business of it for three weeks," John relates, "and followed Brother Parley from place to place."

The result of this thorough investigation was that John Taylor and his wife, Leonora Cannon Taylor, were baptized on May 9, 1836, by Elder Pratt. Elder Taylor became a staunch supporter of the Prophet Joseph. He was called to the apostleship by revelation on July 8, 1838, and thus began a career of Church leadership that was to continue for forty-nine years.

-At Nauvoo he was editor of the Church weekly, the Nauvoo Neighbor and also for a time of the monthly periodical Times and Seasons (a semi-monthly publication after the first year). In these capacities he became intimately associated with Joseph Smith and grew to love him with a bond that was stronger than any fear of death. He voluntarily accompanied Joseph Smith to Carthage jail and the Prophet's last hours in mortality, indeed his very last hour, were soothed and comforted by the tender and wholesome spirit and loving friendship of John Taylor.

During the attack in which the Prophet lost his life, Elder Taylor received four musket balls in his body, one of which he carried with him to the grave. As a member of the Council of the Twelve he did extensive missionary work, opening Ireland, France, and Germany to the preaching of the gospel: and supervising the translation of the Book of Mormon into French and German.

At the death of Brigham Young in 1877, John Taylor was senior member of the Council of The Twelve and by virtue of this office, presided over the Church during the apostolic presidency which lasted until 1880. In October of the latter year the First Presidency was reorganized and he was sustained as President of the Church, with George Q. Cannon (whom he had converted in England in 1840) and Joseph F. Smith (later to become the sixth President of the Church) as his counselors. This Presidency served the Church until 1887.

This decade from 1877 to 1887 was a trying one, filled with a series of vexatious crusades and troublesome political struggles carried on by enemies of the Church against the Church in the Territory of Utah. The courage that President Taylor had manifested in the face of death in Carthage jail now guided him in his administration of Church affairs.

In addition to conducting the affairs of the Church at headquarters, he planned and directed the openings of the Mexican and Maori (New Zealand) missions; inaugurated the Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Upper Snake River Valley colonizations of the saints; planned the colonization of saints in Mexico and sent missionaries to labor among the Indians in Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Arizona.

It was during President Taylor's administration that the golden jubilee of the Church was celebrated, and in spite, of the persecution that was directed against the saints it was made a time of rejoicing.

Debts due the Perpetual Emigration Fund by poor saints were cancelled, as were overdue tithes; cattle, and sheep were distributed to the poor and the needy; and the Relief Society was called upon to assist in the good work for the benefit of the Church as a whole. The preceding year had been one of great drought and there was a scarcity of seed-wheat for the new crop. President Taylor suggested that the Relief Society sisters lend their 34,761 bushels of stored wheat— they had been accumulating it for years against a time of need—to the farmers, to be repaid without interest after the harvest. 'This was gladly done and proved to be of great benefit to all of the settlements.

President Taylor was a man of culture and refinement. He wrote as a gifted theologian and a profoundly religious philosopher. His literary writings, as well as his sermons, manifest a beautiful style. As recreation he wrote religious poetry and drama. His best known poems which have been set to music are the missionary hymn, "Go Ye Messengers of Glory," "The Glorious Plan," and "The Seer," in which latter he poured out his heart concerning his departed Prophet-leader.

Due to the crusade that was being waged against the Church, President Taylor was faced with the alternative of submitting to a prison sentence or retiring from the public eye. He chose the latter course and made no public appearance after February 1884. From his post in exile he directed the affairs of the Church to the best of his ability. The enforced separation from his family and his inability to get the exercise to which he was accustomed, undoubtedly shortened his life. He died in exile at Kaysville, Utah, on July 25, 1887.

God had guided this leader from his native England to the New World where the restored gospel awaited him, and then given him inspiration to guide the destinies of the kingdom. Of God on earth was George O. Cannon

George Q. Cannon, whom President Taylor chose to be his first counselor in 1880, was born in Liverpool, England in 1827, and was baptized by Elder Taylor in June 1840. Emigrating with his parents to Nauvoo in 1842, he went to live at the home of his uncle, Elder John Taylor, and until 1849 was considered a part of the Taylor household. At Nauvoo he learned the printing and publishing business under the tutelage of his uncle, and this skill proved of great worth to himself and the Church in later years.

He emigrated to Utah in 1847. "Bibles Since 1863 at Your Bookstore" "Better Living" Buy From YOUR DEALER Utah Power & Light Company

Brigham Young recognized in him a man of great ability both in temporal and spiritual matters, and he was called as a missionary to the Hawaiian Islands in 1850. He remained there until 1854 and during these four years was primarily instrumental in the conversion of about four thousand natives to the Church. He acquired great proficiency in the use of the Hawaiian language and translated The Book of Mormon into that tongue, and later at San Francisco, published this work.

He was ordained an apostle August 26, 1860, and left soon afterward for New York where he acted as immigration agent for the Church. In 1861 he established the first Church owned printing shop in England, and for many years this establishment was the chief publishing center for Church literature. While in charge of the British Mission between 1862 and 1864, he directed the emigration of upwards of 13,000 saints to America in especially chartered vessels. Charles Dickens visited one of these vessels before it sailed, to make a report on emigration, and saw President Cannon supervising and organizing the group for the voyage. He paid President Cannon and the Mormon emigrants some fine compliments in his article in Uncommercial Traveler.

President Cannon established the Juvenile Instructor (now The Instructor) in 1866, as a means of teaching the gospel to the youth of Zion. He devoted many years to the organization of the Sunday Schools in the Church and was a member of the Sunday School Union from its organization in 1867 until his death in 1901. A man of great speaking and reasoning ability, he was elected as territorial delegate to Congress for ten years and held numerous positions within the territorial government of Utah.

To President Cannon the Church is greatly indebted for the publishing of much of its literature. He encouraged many of the early converts to the Church and more recent ones to write their religious experiences for the benefit of the young people. These were subsequently published in the Juvenile Instructor and as pamphlets or booklets. As first counselor to John Taylor, he shared with his President the hardships of the persecutions of the 1880's and stood by him as a valiant assistant in managing the affairs of the Church.

Joseph F. Smith The second counselor of President John Taylor, Joseph F. Smith, was a son of Hyrum Smith, brother of the Prophet, and was born at Far West, Missouri, on November 13, 1838. He had spent a life of service for the Church at the time the call to the Presidency came in 1880. He had gone on his first mission at the age of fifteen to the Hawaiians and had been ordained an apostle in 1866.

A further account of his life and labors will appear in the following lesson and the one dealing with him as President of the Church.
