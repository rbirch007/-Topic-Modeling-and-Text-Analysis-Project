Risen Flame

Ruth Harwood All life should be fluidic,

Should freely flow upon the stream of time.

Save only man's one constancy.

Save only spirit's risen flame!

The attitude of complacency with which we think of home is responsible for many of the accidents which occur therein. We think of home as a place to drop all our troubles and worries—the one place where we can completely relax. But often we relax too completely.

We must be alert to the hazards in our homes, for they are more common than we realize. We caution our children to be careful when they go out away from the home circle, when they are driving, or taking part in sports, or even in crossing the streets, but we seldom think it necessary to caution them of conditions in the home. Another reason for home accidents is the fact that we are so familiar with conditions in and around our own homes that we don't recognize them as dangers, or if we do, we feel sure we can successfully cope with them. Perhaps our basement stairs have been poorly lighted or without a handrail, for goodness knows how long, but every member of the family is so used to them he is sure he can descend blindfolded. Maybe mother has used a none-too solid stepladder for hanging curtains and washing woodwork for many years, but no disaster has ever happened, no one has fallen, so why not go on using it for several years more? Water has been dripping off the eaves onto the front steps and freezing there, for many winters, but no one has slipped or broken a leg, so why get excited about it? Sometimes people feel they just can't afford to have repair work done or new installations made, and it seems to be human nature to delay the remedying of faulty conditions until something serious occurs. They continue with slipshod practices until an accident does take place, then bemoan their lack of wisdom after the milk is already spilt. It is always economy to keep the home and its premises in good repair and in a safe condition.

There are many little practices which mothers, especially, should impress upon themselves until they are unconsciously aware of them at all times: handles of pans and kettles should always be turned in toward the stove, away from the reach of curious hands. Three-year-old David spent weeks of suffering in a hospital, and his parents spent hundreds of dollars and weeks of excruciating anxiety because David's mother left the handle of the pan in which she was making seven-minute cake icing, projecting over the edge of the stove. Avoid carrying hot liquids. Stair carpets should be inspected often to make sure they are securely fastened. Toys or other articles should not be left on stair steps. (Falls constitute the majority of accidents and fatalities in the home.) Disconnect electrical equipment when leaving it. Don't leave small children alone. Don't leave a small child in the bathtub while answering the phone or going on any other errand. It takes only a very short time, Page 611 and a very little water for a little one to drown. And no one can predict the length of telephone conversations. 'They may take only a moment, but again they may be ten or thirty minutes in length. Matches and poisons should be kept out of reach of children. Rightly, poisons should be kept under lock and key. In using new electrical, or other equipment, always read and follow instructions carefully. "The right way is always the safe way."

There are certain fallacies that must be overcome, also, if we are to prevent accidents. The National Safety Council lists them in the following order: 1. The attitude that "It can't happen to me." A terrible accident might happen to you, or you, or you, but it just wouldn't happen to me. What a mistaken ideal! A good slogan is: "Be careful, the life you save may be your own." 2. The attitude that "When my number's up, I'll go." This idea is fatalistic and is a denial of personal responsibility. Surely all the accidents that do happen, don't have to happen! 3. Relying on the law of averages to keep safe. 4. The idea that it is "sissified" to be careful.' Young people, especially, are guilty of this fallacy. 5. The idea that accidents are the price of progress that they are the price we pay for any advancement of science or industry and just one of those things we must accept. But figures prove that industry, through concentrated effort, has eliminated accidents to a surprisingly low figure far below the number that take place in the homes. 6. The idea that accidents are the price of sin. We often hear people say, "What have I done to deserve this?" While accidents may not be the price of what we term sin, they many times are the price of someone's carelessness or bad practices. It is an individual responsibility to guard not only one's life but the lives of others, as well.

Let us rid our minds of false notions and let us not relax beyond the point of safety in our homes.

Desert Rain
Eva Willes Wangsgaard

A day like this engenders gratitude. You hear the rain plink-plank a great guitar; you watch it fall where growing ponds include each singing drop to make a silver star. This is a day for walking. You can feel the rain's smooth fingers on your hands and face, and earth's resilience underneath your heel, where grasses spilling silver interlace. You swing off down the pathway, and the rain hangs silver fringes round you everywhere. Each stream-filled gutter is a silver lane as you stride onward breathing silver air. You rise above the city's sordid crowd and pace the silver lining of a cloud.

September Day
Evelyn Fjeldsted

Oh, beautiful September day,
thy calm throughout the centuries
comes gently to the heart attuned
as quiet hours steal away.
Time is painting orchard wealth,
hills are veiled in mystery;
errant winds are whispering
selecting autumn drapery.

Thy peace is sweet, fade not away,
oh, beautiful September day.

Sudden Storm
Carol Read Flake

H, what a beautiful morning!
Janet Harding caroled happily as she ran down the back steps with a pan of scraps for the dog. The world was filled to bursting with the glory of early summer—the iris bowing gracefully along the driveway, the willow tree sweeping the green carpet of lawn. Who could putter around with housework on a day like this? Besides, the flowers at the side of the house needed weeding. Janet's smile broadened at the intermittent clatter of the lawn mower around front. "That was Benny, just turned six, struggling to show his little sister that he, too, was big enough to mow the lawn." "Oh, what a beautiful da-a-y! Here, Ricky! Here, Ricky!" Janet set the pan of scraps on the ground, caught up the trowel that lay in the children's wagon, and rounded the comer of the house. "I have a wonderful fee...." The song froze on her lips. Across the hedge Marj Appleby was hanging a wash, her slight figure straightened, towel in hand, her eyes met Janet's. But only for an instant. Turning her back, she gave the towel a flip that sounded like a shot out of a gun.

Woodenly past the tangled flowers front of the house. "Mommie! Mommie!" Sharon screamed, dancing excitedly about.

Page 614

flamed and for a rooted to the she walked to the Benny and the mower. "See what Benny do."

"Oh, hush, Sharon. Stop that screeching," Janet answered irritably, sitting down on the warm cement step. "Benny, get away from that machine."

The boy's mouth fell open. "But Mom I'm mowing the lawn. You told Daddy it gotta be mowed." 

Janet was not listening. With her chin cupped in her hands she gazed absently beyond the children, her brown eyes troubled, her heart a choking weight within her.

For over a month she had been unable to see Marj or even think about her without this awful sick feeling. They hadn't spoken to each other in all that time. And once they had been so close, running into each other's homes without knocking, walking to the grocery together, keeping each other's children while one went to town.

Oh, it was ridiculous that things had come to this stage. But I apologized, Janet reminded herself for the hundredth time. I fell all over myself trying to make amends. She's the one who refuses to speak.

A flock of blackbirds zoomed out of the blue and settled on the hedge for a moment's noisy chatter. Beautiful day! Janet sprang up and went inside, letting the screen door bang behind her.

THE living room was dark to eyes that had been staring into sun. She jerked at down on the light. It was chilly. The drapes and sank SUDDEN STORM davenport in a patch of sunshine. 

It was right here, she remembered miserably, that she had been comfortably dozing when Marj telephoned. "I've sent Benny home," Marj announced, her voice shrill. "I don't mean to make trouble, Janet, and I hope you won't be mad, but really! He and Martin were playing on the back porch and Benny brought Ricky in. He got to jumping around and knocked over the table where I keep my potted plants broke them to pieces. My azaleas, that I've just been nursing along."

"Oh, Marj," Janet moaned. They had bought their azaleas at the same time. "Marj, I'm just sick. I'll give you mine. They're not nearly so..."

"OH, they're just plants, but really." Benny appeared in the kitchen, inching along the sink, his small face twisted with silent weeping. He cast an unhappy glance at his mother and moved out of sight.

"Benny will certainly be punished," Janet promised hotly. "T'll be over in a few minutes, Marj." Janet hung up and advanced upon her son. "Benjamin Harding, I could just I've told you a dozen times to stay out of Appleby's house. And Ricky...." Benny stepped backward. "Mama," he pleaded, "I didn't take Ricky in there. I didn't. It was Martin who whistled him in. He had a ball he was makin' him jump after." His lower lip quivered.

Janet scowled, somewhat mollified. She was visualizing Marj Appleby scolding him, sending him home "Benny Harding, you take this dog of yours and get outa here. I'm gonna call up your Mama right now!" 

"OH, Benny," the boy sobbed against her, "Ricky broke all her nice plants, darling. You shouldn't have been in there at all, I've told you, Benny." Benny raised his face. "You said not to go in the house, Mama. Is the porch the house, is it, Mom?" Janet stood biting her lip. "I don't know," she answered absently. "I'm going over there now."

MA8J had been sweeping up dirt, and greeted Janet with an annoyed flourish of her arm. "Isn't this a fine mess?" Janet bent and began picking up pieces of pottery. "I'll replace all these pots," she said quietly, "and any of the plants I can." 

"Oh, indeed you won't. I have empty pots in the basement and the plants will all grow again. It's just that oh, they were doing so well." "I know." Janet waited. Then, "Benny said Martin let the dog in."

Marj stopped sweeping. "Martin," she called, "did you let that dog in here?" 616

RELIEVE SOCIETY MAGAZINE SEPTEMBER 1948

Martin came to the doorway, glanced defiantly at the women. He was sick. In his first year at school.

"Course not," he answered. "Ricky won't mind anybody but Benny."

Marj shrugged and went on with her sweeping. "Well, it doesn't matter who let him in, he did a fine job breaking up my plants."

Janet stared at her. It doesn't matter!" She wanted to cry. So it didn't matter that she had humiliated her son, broken his heart.

She turned abruptly. "I'll see that Benny doesn't come again. He does..."

"Oh, now, Janet," Marj broke in longheartedly. "There's no need for that. He and Martin play so well together."

"He disobeyed me by coming inside at all." Janet finished. "He'll never do it again." She closed the door firmly behind her as she went out.

It was Benny who reported the incident to his father. Janet thought Ben unusually harsh on the boy for his disobedience. But she was completely unprepared for his reproof of her later in the evening.

"The trouble with you, Janet," he told her, "is that you have confused the issue. The real cause of the fuss is Ricky, not Benny. It was the dog Marj wanted to get rid of and she had to send Benny home to do it. Your sympathy was all with Marj until you learned it was probably Martin who let the dog in. Then you imagined some great injustice had been done, when as a matter of fact, it was just as Marj said, it isn't who let him in, but the damage he did by being in. You've apologized for that and offered reparation, which was refused. That should be an end of the matter. There's nothing to be so upset about that I can see."

Janet glared. "Thank you so much, Judge Harding, for your esteemed opinion of the case," she said acidly and flung away from him.

Ben caught her hand, laughing. "Oh, now, honey, I know it isn't quite that simple. I wasn't trying to minimize your hurt, or Benny's. But Benny and Martin will have forgotten this thing by morning. It's you and Marj who must see what a small thing it is before it goes any further. Go see her tomorrow. Everything will be all right.

NEXT morning when Janet ran out to bring in the paper, Marj, as it often happened, was just leaving to drive her husband to work. She looked right at her. Janet was positive about that; but before she could speak, Marj had turned back quickly to close the door. Any other day Janet would have called out a cheery good morning, regardless. But this morning, self-consciously, she refrained. All day she fretted about the incident.

The next morning was almost an exact repetition. Marj made a great business of pulling on her gloves and closing the door, giving Janet ample time to pick up the paper and return inside. After that, Janet sent Benny for the paper. And that was the beginning of many awkward evasions that were making life miserable for her.
Such as last week when Benny had his sixth birthday, such an important anniversary to a little boy, and she hadn't given him a party simply because she hadn't the heart either to invite or exclude Martin, SUDDEN STORM his favorite playmate. For, of course, the little boys continued playing blissfully together, just as Ben had predicted. Ben! Janet started guiltily. He was due home for lunch this minute, and here she sat. From the kitchen window she watched as he turned in the driveway. Across the lot she saw Marj Appleby backing out of her garage. Of course. This was Friday. Marj always drove out to her mother's on this day. Often Janet and the children rode along. Wouldn't today be perfect for a drive in the country? Well, at least she could take care of those poor flowers. She had neglected them all these weeks because they were on the side of the house next to Appleby's!
"Hi, honey," Ben greeted her, coming in with Sharon on his shoulders and Benny clinging leach-like to his leg. He deposited his little daughter in her high chair and beamed proudly at Benny. "Well, Mama, I see you have a gardener to help keep up the place. Did you notice the front lawn?" Janet managed a tight little smile. Keeping up the place was often a touchy subject in the Harding household. "He worked real hard at it," she conceded. "But, oh, Ben, there's so much to be done here. The hedge needs trimming and my pansies...." She paused, then plunged on impulsively. "Ben, why don't we sell this place while prices are up? We could get by on a place with half this yard space, get a place closer in or farther out...." Her voice trailed off uncertainly as she became aware of Ben's openmouthed expression. "Sell?" he repeated. "Why, Janet, I thought you considered this place ideal. I know I don't have much time for the yard, but you said yourself we needed plenty of room so we could add to the house as our family increased." Janet bit her lip and bent quickly to tie Sharon's bib. Somehow she did not want to meet Ben's gaze.
The children did most of the talking at the table. As Ben finished his dessert he remarked casually, "I saw Marj leaving for her mother's. Doesn't she ask you to go along any more?" Janet gave him a quick glance. "I have a lot of work to do outside," she evaded. She felt an unaccountable resentment toward her husband. Was he being callous or caustic? She made no move to walk out to the car with him as she usually did and he did not come around the table to kiss her. At the door he turned. "I can ask Browning and Bates how much this place should bring." Then he added pointedly, "You know, you can move away from your neighborhood, but you can't move away from yourself."
Janet stared after him, feeling her face grow scarlet. She squeezed her eyes tightly over the hot tears and left the table abruptly so the children would not see. Almost mechanically she did the dishes, put Sharon down for her nap and went out to the pansy bed. She found no joy whatever in her work. The bursting enthusiasm of the morning that had thrust all thought of Marj Appleby from her mind had dissolved into a spirit of listless dejection. She felt all bogged down in a situation that would not better itself with the mere passage of time. Rather it had grown worse. She had spoken thoughtlessly at noon, and now Ben was hurt and displeased with her. His words still stung: You can't move away from yourself.
Oh, Ben, she pleaded in her heart, what am I going to do? She had waited too long to follow his suggestion. After all this time, could she go to the Appleby door and say, Marj, can't we forget this thing between us, can't we be friends again? No, she could not.
The sun disappeared. Janet glanced up and was mildly surprised to see that the western sky had grown murky. Rain again. She rose stiffly and went inside. Sharon needed covering. Crossing to her own room, Janet stood contemplating the little half-finished pinafore. She was in no mood for sewing. Restlessly she walked through the rooms. It was growing darker. An elusive brilliance darted in and out of the house.
Janet went to the back door and called to Benny, but her voice was lost in the explosion of thunder. She ran down the steps and around the house, her skirt billowing in a sudden gust of wind. Benny was tugging at the lawn mower. "Never mind, Mom," he vowed. "I can get it in the garage." "Well, hurry, dear. It's going to pour in a minute." She turned back. Then she stopped. "Oh!" she gasped, and darted across the lawn and through the opening in the hedge.
A splinter of lightning was hurled across the horizon. "The next will bring rain," Janet mumbled into Marj's crisp, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE SEPTEMBER 1948 whipping sheets as her fingers groped for the clothespins. Back in her own kitchen Janet set about preparing dinner. The children cluttered the floor with their blocks, the eaves of the house dripped monotonously after the downpour. But a song rose to Janet's lips as she contentedly pared potatoes at the sink. She felt refreshed and at peace with herself, a peace she had not known in a long while.
For Janet had reached a decision. It was a simple decision, one she had stubbornly rejected all these weeks. It had come to her after she had hurried with the last armful of clothes into Marj's kitchen and piled them with the others on the table. She brought a basket from the porch and pressed into it all the pieces that had tumbled to the floor. The sheets and towels she folded, making a neat stack upon the drainboard.
And as she worked, there in Marj Appleby's kitchen that was almost as familiar to her as her own, Janet experienced again the warmth and intimacy of their long friendship, remembering their little acts of helpfulness for each other, small services gladly given. The rain swept in gusts against the windowpanes and Janet glanced out of Marj's window across the way to her own home, the Harding home. In that moment it was almost as if she were Marj Appleby, and Janet knew with startling clarity that Marj was as deeply hurt and wretched over the whole affair as she herself was.
It was then Janet had made her decision.

She promised herself that the minute Marj returned, the very minute, mind you, she would run out and throw her arms about her Sudden Storm and tell her what a stubborn, stupid horrid person she had been. And Ben, dear Ben, she could hardly wait to tell him the same. She had raced home through the rain, her heart singing. Janet stopped humming and leaned far over her sink so she could watch the street, watch for Appleby's car. Why, there it was now, in their driveway. She heard a quick sound on the porch. The kitchen door burst open. Marj Appleby stood there, her eyes brimming. "Janet.... My clothes...." "Marj!" The paring knife dropped to the floor. "Oh, Marj," Janet cried as they rushed into each other's arms. They were both crying and trying to talk at the same time. Finally they had to stop and they stood back, laughing at themselves.

Later, as they were chatting beside the hedge, their children and Ricky romped about the lawn. Everything had the green, fragrant freshness that follows a sudden summer rain, and the sun's low rays filled the world with that special mellow glow. Janet heard a car on the gravel and turned eagerly, joyfully. Ben stepped from the car, his face reflecting the sun's golden light as he smiled at the two women across the lawn. "Ben," Janet called happily, waving her arms in a sweeping gesture that took in their house, the yard, the whole world, "Oh, Ben darling, isn't this a beautiful evening!"

BETWEEN FRIENDS
Mabel Jones Gabbott

Last night we disagreed;
And though the cause was slight,
I found no peace at all
Until we talked it right.

Today, the threads that link
Our hearts and bind our need
Are stronger than before
Because we disagreed.

HOMECOMING
Josephine J. Harvey

He saw all the dear, familiar things
That had not changed while he had been away,
And deep within his heart he knew
How good it was, to be back home to stay.

He turned to her who stood beside him,
Whose lifted face was waiting for his kiss.
Her love his beacon light would never dim
He thought: God meant heaven to be like this.

Plain and Savory
NEW RECIPES FOR FAMILIAR FOODS
Sara Mills

F broiled steak and fried chicken aren't compatible with your budget, don't get discouraged. There are still good things to be had.
Some of the world's best dishes had their origins in the cookery of folk who had to make plain food savory and nourishing.
One such dish I herewith christen savory cabbage rolls. Up until now it has graced our table unnamed.
It is served on gala occasions when our guests are specially appreciative of good food. Fine fare it is also for the family.
If it isn't eaten in one meal, it is even better the second day. Six to eight persons may be served from it.

To round out savory cabbage rolls into a complete meal, add only a salad and a dessert.
For balanced vitamins and an artistic effect, you may like to serve a yellow vegetable with the meal.
Carrots, shredded and baked in a covered dish, are good. Frozen cut corm is another easy and pleasing vegetable to serve.

If you have been with me these past months, you know that I favor fruit for dessert.
If I serve a fruit dessert, I let the salad be a green, tossed one. But if I serve cake, I make a fruit gelatine salad.
Along with some hot dinner rolls or some French bread, oven-toasted with garlic butter, a splendid meal awaits.

SAVORY CABBAGE ROLLS
1 large head of green cabbage (or two smaller ones)
1 pound ground lean beef, either chuck or round, but lean
Y% pound ground lean pork
1 generous teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon or so grated onion
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 clove garlic minced (optional)
dash of Tabasco sauce
1 cup uncooked rice, preferably brown
salt and pepper to taste
pulp from 1-quart can tomatoes
juice from 1-quart can tomatoes
1 small can tomato sauce (optional)
a pinch of basil

First remove the core from the head of cabbage.
Place the cabbage in a covered pan containing a cup of water and let cook until the leaves begin to soften.
Then remove the cabbage from the water. Meantime prepare all the other ingredients except the tomato juice and basil by mixing them together in a large bowl. Make sure that you have plenty of salt.

Place a spoonful of the mixture in the center of a cabbage leaf and fold envelope-wise, securing the leaf with a toothpick.
Set the rolls gently in a large, heavy kettle, preferably one with a rack, or in an electric casserole, if you are lucky enough to own one. Pour the tomato juice over the cabbage rolls; add salt and pepper and the pinch of basil; cover and let steam for at least two hours.

After the dish has steamed awhile, I like to add the tomato sauce, or a portion of it.
The trick in cooking is to simmer the rolls gently and get just the right amount of liquid for serving. If you get too little, the dish is dry, too much, and the quality isn't right.
You may, if necessary, add extra juice, a little chili sauce, or even water.

Serve this dish in the electric casserole or transfer it to a large, heated platter. Then wait for the reactions.

My second special meat dish is Lamb Stew, spelled with capitals.
This is no ordinary lamb stew such as legend connects with boarding houses or hasty cooks.
It-is a PLAIN AND SAVORY delectable dish, good enough for any company or Sunday dinner.
The cheapest cuts of lamb are used. And you will do well to remember that the origin of this dish is French.

LAMB STEW
2 pounds lamb cut in small pieces (neck, shoulder, or breast cuts)
10 or so small white onions or one medium sliced onion
2 tablespoons flour
3 cups meat stock or 3 cups water and 3 bouillon cubes
salt and pepper
1 flavor bouquet (1 small bay leaf, 1 sprig thyme, 6 sprigs parsley and 3 sprigs celery leaves, tied with thread)
1 clove. Garlic
1 cup tomato puree
3 carrots, diced
% pound cut green beans
% pound green peas
2-3 potatoes sliced
1 small can mushrooms (or fresh, if you have them)
1 tbsp. Chopped parsley for serving
cheese and parsley dumplings (optional)

Sear the lamb pieces, with fat trimmed off, until all sides are browned.
Bacon drippings are good for this. Season with salt and pepper and add the onions, peeled, or peeled and sliced, and cook until they are well browned.
Drain off all the fat and put the mixture in a stew pot or large earthen casserole.

Now sift the two tablespoons of flour over the meat and mix well.
621

Next add gradually the three cups of stock and the cup of tomato puree, the clove of garlic, salt and pepper, and the bouquet, which you have previously tied with a thread. Bring the mixture to a boil, then let it simmer slowly for about an hour. Then add the diced carrots, the potatoes, the string beans, and peas, along with the mushrooms and let simmer until the vegetables are tender. Taste also for seasoning. Remove the bouquet and serve on a heated, deep platter with the parsley dusting the top of the stew. If you like dumplings, drop them onto the stew about twelve minutes before the dish has finished cooking. Add a handful of chopped parsley and 1/3 cup grated cheese to your favorite dumpling recipe. Or you may prefer a shortcut to dumplings. Mine is to mix a half cup of milk with a cup of prepared waffle flour and season with the cheese and parsley. Remember not to remove the lid while the dumplings are steaming. Serve a fruit salad with this Lamb Stew or a dessert of fresh fruit and cheese.

OMNIPOTENCE
Jeanette P. Parry

I saw the yellow moon above the clouds
That climb into the blue of peaceful skies,
A silence filled the woods like huddled sheep,
Save when the crimson leaves fell down to sleep.
There was no afterglow of summer life,
Only the flash of a late robin's breast;
I saw the grass, frost-browned at winter's will,
The rivulets that trickled cold and still.

I was not troubled that skies were leaden
And leafless aspens graced the frost-touched hills,
A Power greater than our own bestows
The miracle of crimson woods and snows.

The Family Picture Show
Ivie H. Jones
President, Spanish-American Mission Relief Society

MY Dear Aunt Martha:

I guess I really shouldn't address you as Aunt, but that's what Mother used to call you. Let's see, you must be a third cousin, but that's unimportant. You belong to the same family and have some Calkins blood in your veins, and that makes me proud of you, even though I have never seen you. And because you are a relative and the oldest hiring member of your side of the family, I am writing you this letter.

Under separate cover, we are mailing you quite a collection of photographs, snaps, and tintypes. I am sure you would wonder what on earth it was all about, if I did not write and explain the matter in advance. Last night we held our annual "Family Picture Show." It's an old idea of Mother's and has grown into quite an event in our family, and because it was Mother's original idea, we have held it on her birthday.

Sometimes it has been impossible for all of us to get together on that particular day, as we are quite scattered, but in that went we have held our own "Family Picture Show." Yesterday was Mother's birthday, the first one since she died, and all of us were together, quite a group, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. We met in the old home, and in spite of the fact that Mother and Daddy weren't there, it carried on according to the old custom.

We all had dinner together, then while the children played outside, we grownups checked our photographs, exchanged with each other, and then saw to it that every picture was identified by the names on the back in ink. I can just hear Mother say, "Upon my word, it makes me sick the way some folks spend good money for pictures and then never take the time to identify them. Then when the old folks die, the pictures mean nothing to the children, so into the wastebasket they go."

Mother and Daddy were always proud of our family, from the ancestors to the great-grandchildren, and they wanted all of us to know our relatives when we saw them. The "Family Hour" that followed was choice, for it offered opportunity for our different families to present their talents in song, original composition, and verse. And the climax of the evening was our "Family Picture Show."

We have a toy projector that Mother and Daddy bought for us one Christmas, it must have been twenty-five years ago. It cost only five dollars, but it has certainly been worth many times that amount to us. It is a simple little projector, quipped with two electric lights and mirrors inside, and we just slip the pictures in, upside down, and they are reflected on a screen or wall — and in color, too.

It is surprising how even our little tots know their great-grandparents, their aunts and uncles, and even their cousins, when their pictures are thrown on the screen. I am sure that I would know you if I should ever see you on the street, even though I have never actually seen you in my life.

Yesterday afternoon we found a lot of pictures of your side of the family that we thought would mean more to you than they do to us. However, if you already have copies of them, we would be glad to have them back. There is one tintyped marked "Cristina" that I am especially interested in. Perhaps it is because my full name is Page 622 THE FAMILY PICTURE SHOW 623 Anna Cristine, but I have always been called just "Ann." Or perhaps I am interested in the picture because there is a bit of mystery connected with it.

I have asked Mother about this tintype many times, only to be put off. Once I asked her why she didn't add the maiden name, or married name, that is, if this Cristina was ever married. But Mother merely said, "No, my dear, Cristina signed her own name on the picture and that's enough. I know who she was and you children don't know her anyway."

Still not satisfied, I pressed the matter further, only to be told that Cristina died when her first baby was born and the second wife did such a marvelous job of caring for her baby that the family decided not to tell her who her real mother was. "Put the tintype back in the drawer," Mother said, "I will be going to Utah sometime and I will find out if the daughter knows. I have never asked, and no one has ever said."

Once Mother did, however, write something on the bottom of the picture, and yesterday we used a magnifying glass and made out the name of Cristina's parents. Maybe you will know where she fits into the family, or perhaps she is just a dear friend of Mother's.

Please excuse this lengthy letter, and if you do not know to whom the tintype picture belongs, return it to me, as I would like to keep it.

Lots of love to all.

Your cousin, Ann: Your letter and the pictures came several days ago, but I have been too excited to write. The children and grandchildren are all coming over for my birthday today and we are having our first "Family Picture Show." Many thanks for the idea. Lots of love. Aunt Martha

P.S. Yes, I know who this Christine is, and the tintype is worth the world to me. She was an orphan girl from Norway. She joined the Church, and the rest of the family disowned her. Later, she came to Utah and married and had one daughter. We have spent a great deal of money trying to discover her parents. I am so glad that your mother wrote on the picture before she died, "Daughter of Tildy and Hans Nielson." Thanks a million, Ann, that's my mother.

Winds of fear are blowing through the night
That the windbreaks of the heart cannot abate.
With subtle infiltrations, they would kill
The tendrils of our hope, regenerate.
Only barricades within the soul
Of ancient kindnesses withhold their blight.
Only love's assurance can resist
The winds of fear that blow across the night.

The picture on top of the cake was made in sugar, representing the first house in which the Relief Society was held, copied from a picture which the elders gave Brother Leslie.
It was a lovely table, well worth the sacrifice of our rations.
Our Relief Society had a show of work and sale on April 17th, with a concert following. It was a great success. The hand-knitted articles made and donated by members and friends brought in around $100. That is very good for our small branch (9 members)."

The Constitution of the United States and Religious Liberty (Continued on page 581)

Is the Sermon on the Mount obsolete because it was delivered almost 2,000 years ago? Have 300 years made obsolete the drama of Shakespeare, or has it been made obsolete by the modern discovery of the silver screen? Have 170 years made obsolete man's love for liberty? Have the years made obsolete man's burning desire to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience?
The Constitution of the United States is the greatest charter of religious liberty ever written. It will never become obsolete so long as men love democracy more than despotism, liberty more than bondage, God more than the paganism of unbelief.

The Art of Beautiful Tone Quality in Singing
PART II

Florence J. Madsen
Member, Relief Society General Board

The language of tones belongs equally to all mankind, and melody is the absolute language in which the musician speaks to every heart (Richard Wagner).

The Laws of Acoustics

BEAUTY of tone is dependent upon the presence of overtones with their fundamentals. To insure the proper predominance of these essential elements the singer must observe the laws of acoustics.
Some of these are:
(a) The motion of the vibrating column must be regular and unobstructed.
(b) The vibrations must be focused in the direction of, and into all possible open cavities for amplification.
(c) There must be no localization of tone in any one cavity, but equal activity to the exclusion of the others. All the cavities of the head and bones of the face are vocal resonators and, therefore, must be used in speaking and in singing.

Listening
Nature has given to men one tongue, but two ears, that we may hear from others twice as much as we speak (Epictetus).
While listening to music one should be so intent upon what he hears that he can recall, at will, the tone quality he has heard, for comparison with other tonal experiences that he might have.

Imitating
One of the most effective means of learning is that of imitating. This fact is voiced by Weiss in the following statement: "Imitation forms our manners, our opinions, our very lives." Imitation also leads to spontaneous originality. This is strongly asserted by Voltaire as follows: "A good imitation is the most perfect originality."
In order to acquire perfect tone quality one must, therefore, imitate the perfect in tonal art.

Reasoning
Reasoning is the cornerstone of all sound thinking.

It is basically essential to a full understanding of beautiful tone quality. Such reasoning should include, at least, the following facts:
(a) To become an aesthetic singer is a distinctive achievement.
(b) To produce beautiful tones one must first submerge his preconceived notions of tone to the more ideal type of tonal quality as heard in the singing of artists.
(c) The characteristics and mechanics of beautiful tones of the arts can be understood only in proportion as they are unfolded and applied in sincere efforts to sing.
(d) Tone quality can be improved only as far as faults are overcome and proper habits established.
It should be remembered that, as Gilpin says, ". . . Good habits are formed by acts of reason. . . ."
LESSON Department Theology The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 11 "He Spake Many Things Unto Them In Parables" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 19, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, December 7, 1948 Objective: To create a desire to study and understand the gospel of the kingdom. Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ.
During the early part of his ministry Jesus was popular. In fact, frequently the multitudes surrounding him were so large they would impede his progress. Because of these large crowds, he found it difficult at times to speak to the multitudes. He, therefore, devised the plan of going to the seashore and having his disciples provide a "small ship" which was kept in readiness for him and in which he sat down and spoke to the crowds. The boat would be anchored a short distance from the shore. It was during one of these meetings at the water's edge that he adopted the method of explaining his talks by using parables.
All students admit that the Savior was the Master Teacher of the world. In teaching, he followed no definite plan or method. He drew his examples from nature. He would see a sower at work in a field, a fox running across his path, a woman at a well, and each would provide him a story to illustrate his doctrine. The things of nature were his own creations and, of course, he knew how to use them to the best advantage.
"A Sower Went Forth to Sow"
The parable of the sower was probably the first parable used by the Savior in teaching. Everyone is familiar with this parable, but there are many who contend that it should, in reality, be called the parable of the soil. The story is as follows:
And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: But others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear (Matt. 13:4-9).
This method of teaching was a new one even to the disciples and was a departure from the Savior's earlier method. He, therefore, gave an interpretation to this parable. In brief, his interpretation was as follows:
Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty (Matt. 13:18-23).
Space will not permit the giving in full of all of the Savior's parables. The parable of the sower is given as an example. All of the parables of the New Testament may be studied with great profit. They are masterpieces of beautiful and effective literature. Only a few salient features will be given here.
Above all we should notice that the Savior had prepared well for his listeners. He was the sower. However, the parable would apply to any authorized servant of the Lord. "The seed is the word of God." He described four grades of soil. First, the compacted roof or highway made by people and hindered animals walking along or over it. It was natural for those near these highways even to cross fields which had been sown to grain. Second: the shallow soil, underlaid by rock, would sustain the sprouting plant only for a short time, after which it would wither and die. Third: the soil upon which weed seed had been sown. Ground otherwise capable of producing a crop would not yield because of the thickness of thistles and thorns. Fourth and last: the fertile soils which would yield an increase of thirty, sixty, or even an hundredfold.
It is interesting to note that the thorns which spring up in the poor grade of soil to choke the word of God are the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches." In good soil, the teacher sows the seeds of truth with anticipation and enthusiasm, knowing that there will be a harvest; perhaps not the expected harvest, but still thirtyfold if not an hundredfold" (Dr. Carl F. Eyring-Good Tidings to All People). Even Jesus was limited by the soil. Let teachers learn to prepare well the soil.
The Wheat and the Tares
Another of the Master's great parables was the one about the wheat and the tares. (Matt. 13:24-30; 36-43) Here Jesus changes and has the seed represent the children of men. The good seed typifies the honest in heart and the righteous in the kingdom of God, while the tares are the evil minded and those who keep not the commandments of the Lord. The Master's servants wanted to immediately pull them up, but were told it could not be done without great destruction of the precious grain. The disciples were taught a lesson of patience, tolerance, and forbearance. They were assured that a time would come when there would be a separation and the tares would be burned. The time and manner were to be left to the Lord.
The Lord, speaking to Joseph Smith in 1832, referred to this parable (D. & C. 86:4-7). It is suggested that the entire section be read.

The Mustard Seed
The application made in the parable of the mustard seed was entirely in terms, for the children of Israel had long looked forward to the coming in great glory of the Messiah. It startled them to hear its beginning compared with a mustard seed. However, the use of the mustard plant for food was common among the Jews. In Palestine the mustard plant attains a largeness in comparison with time than it does in the northerly climes. The lesson of the parable is relatively easy to learn. "... the seed of truth is vital, living, and capable of such development as to furnish spiritual food and shelter to all who come seeking." The size of the kingdom to be was not to be judged because it had a small beginning.

The Leaven
The parable of the leaven is quoted frequently. It is easily understood. Like the one last considered, it typifies the vitality and inherent power to grow. Yeast diffuses itself throughout a lifeless lump and changes the flour to a buoyant mass of dough. The truths of the gospel have the power within themselves when understood, to leaven the whole lump of humanity. Both the leaven in the flour and the spread of truth are sometimes slow in action but they work quietly and effectively.

A. Perry Picture Hofmann
CHRIST TEACHING FROM A BOAT

While the leaven symbolizes truth, it must be remembered that the same thing, in different aspects, may be used to represent evil. Evil power may also permeate or "leaven" the whole lump.

The Hidden Treasure
The parable of the hidden treasure is recorded only by Matthew (13:44). The critic has often said that it was not honest for the finder to conceal the discovery of the treasure from the owner of the field. We may be assured that Jesus would not commend a dishonest act. The finder followed the Jewish law and all that was done was in accordance with the law of the day. Let us remember, also, that in the parabolic teaching of the day, little attention was given to what might be called the trappings, or outward forms. Certainly no one would, or did consider these trappings as an integral part of the story.

The happy man who found the treasure sold all he possessed and gave up everything gladly in order that he might purchase the field. The Master taught by this illustration that when once the treasure of the kingdom is found, the finder should lose no time nor shrink from any sacrifice needful to insure his title thereto.

The Pearl of Great Price
The parable of the pearl of great price should be carefully studied (Matt. 13:45-46). Of course, the pearl is used to represent great value. The merchant was seeking goodly pearls.
RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE SEPTEMBER 1948

When he found one which excelled all others, he sacrificed all he had to obtain it; it was the pearl of great price. The pearl represents truth. When it is found, no price is too great for its possession. No one can truly become a citizen of the kingdom who is unwilling to surrender all for that citizenship. "The amount each person must pay depends on how much is 'his all.' That only is a sufficient price."

Latter-day Saints have a great heritage. Their pioneer forebears gave their all for the "pearl of great prices."

The Gospel Net
Dr. John A. Widtsoe, in his book The Gospel Net, gives pathos and meaning to the parable of the same name. The gospel of the kingdom has been preached in many lands. It has gathered into its folds good and bad people, mostly good. Often the sorting does not take place until the people have gathered in Zion, and it may not be completely done there. The great "Fisher of Men" will make the final sorting eventually. The just and the unjust will be separated, and each given a reward according to merit.

Questions and Suggestions for Discussion
1. State why you think Jesus was a great teacher. From what source did he draw his great examples to illustrate his teaching?
2. Relate the parable of the sower and tell why it is sometimes called the parable of the soil.
3. Describe the parable of the wheat and the tares. What was the lesson taught by it?
4. If a copy of the book The Gospel Net is available, have someone tell briefly the story of the conversion of the mother of Dr. John A. Widtsoe.

LESSON DEPARTMENT 637
Visiting Teachers Messages
Our Savior Speaks Lesson 3 "Inasmuch as Ye Have Done It Unto One of the Least of These My Brethren, Ye Have Done It unto Me"
Elder H. Wayne Driggs

For Tuesday, December 7, 1948
Objective: To reaffirm what constitutes the true spirit of giving.

Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger and ye took me in: Naked and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me (Matt. 25:34-40).

In essence, is thought of as being temporal rather than spiritual. Most of us are earth-drawn throughout the majority of our living days. We seek learning, work, position, and favor among our fellow men. In our struggle to attain these, we find passing satisfaction in the material things of the world. But there are greater things than these which make the material gains of life of secondary importance. The important values are the joys of the spirit. These come from the perfect service of feeding the Master's sheep.

It is said by modern teachers that if someone holds a grudge against you, and you can get that person to do you a favor, his enmity will disappear for we cannot dislike one to whom we do good. Is it not true that one reason for the love of parents for their children is that they minister lovingly to the needs of their offspring? How then can we demonstrate our love for our Savior whom we cannot meet face to face? By obeying the first great commandment and the second which is like unto it: by loving our neighbors as ourselves. Then we shall better understand that the Lord who so loved each of us that he suffered death that we might live, accepts the service we give any of our brethren as being given to him.

What a great opportunity our Church affords us to give such service through accepting calls to work in any capacity. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).

Work Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 3 Making Women's Wear from Men's Wear Jean Ridges Jennings

For Tuesday, December 14, 1948

N most cases the wool used in men's suits, if it is of good quality, is far sturdier and more durable than that available in stores for women's clothing. Even after it has been discarded as shabby or worn out, the average man's suit offers unusual opportunities for making-over, because of the excellence of its texture and quality. The worn parts are usually found in places where they can be ignored when making over the man's suit into one for a woman. Such parts as sleeve edges, plackets, trouser seat, and cuffs can all be cut away without interfering with a woman's suit. When making a man's suit over into a street suit for yourself, it is usually necessary to shorten the sleeves, which does away with the worn part, and it is unnecessary to use the upper part of the trousers which eliminates those worn parts. The legs of the trousers are turned upside down to make the skirt, bringing any weak spots toward the hem and also allowing a little flare at the bottom. Fit the coat to your proportions. Make the shoulders narrower with a center dart tapered to the bustline in front. Narrow the neckline at the center back seams of coat and collar. Adjust the hip and waistline with a dart taken from the coat hem to under the bust, being sure it is in line with the shoulder dart. The side seams can be fitted as needed according to the lines of the figure. Sleeves can be taken in as needed, tapering them to match the underarm seams and the armhole. Shorten as necessary.

Using the upper part of the trousers for the bottom, make a four-gored skirt. The new longer length can be obtained by making a fitted yoke for the top of the skirt from the unused top of the trousers or from the vest. When the man's suit is too faded or shabby to use on the right side, tip the suit to pieces, clean and remake using the wrong side of the fabric for the right side of your suit. The entire suit will need to be recut, using a commercial pattern.

On most women the pockets in a man's coat come rather low. If they are patch pockets, they can be raised. If bound or flap pockets, a patch pocket can be set over them at a higher more becoming level. An attractive lady's suit can be made by cutting the coat short to just below the waistline thus avoiding the pockets entirely. For this model the collar can be eliminated and a plain fitted neckline used instead. If the suit is striped, many clever effects can be devised as trimming by reversing the stripes in bands, pockets, yokes, etc.

Last, but not least, the man's coat could be easily made into a bolero.

*Literature—*literature of the Latter-day Saints
Literature of the Gospel Restoration
Lesson 3—Gospel Messages from the Book of Mormon
Elder Howard R. Driggs
For Tuesday, December 21, 1948
MAIN emphasis is given in the Book of Mormon to the "things of God." As a result, in every book of this scripture will be found awe-coined, principles of the gospel impressively and plainly stated, and prophetic literature of soul-stirring quality. All of these spiritual expressions are in accord with the Bible, whose divine lessons of life are amplified and clarified by this other "Book of Books."
Our readers may recall that in the study of the Bible from the literary viewpoint, we dealt with what Dr. Moulton calls Wisdom Literature. The book of "Proverbs" is made up of such literature—sayings of practical worth and uplift, pointing the way of righteousness. In the Book of Mormon, there is no such book. Bringing together the bits of wisdom, but similar gems of distinctive literary quality are to be found in many of the chapters of the book. Following are examples of these treasures of wisdom:
Yes, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things (1 Nephi 11:22).
The guilty taketh the truth to be hard; for it cutteth them to the very center (1 Nephi 16:2).
Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy (2 Nephi 2:25).
See that ye have faith, hope and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works (Alma 7:24).
This is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and is my joy (Alma 29:9).
Do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?—do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week? (Alma 32:10).
Blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble (Alma 32:16).
Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek (Ether 12:26).
For the eternal purposes of the Lord shall go on, until all his promises shall be fulfilled (Mormon 5:22).
I love little children with a perfect love, and they are all alike and partakers of salvation (Moroni 8:17).
We have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness (Mormon 9:6).
Many, as they read these gems of spiritual thought, will recall others they have found in the Book of Mormon. A search for such treasures will bring true riches. What may be found of appeal to each one who seeks, will be more deeply impressed if the choice saying is written and kept in a little book of reference. This practice is commended.
Vitality will also be given to this search for precious lines if the gems are studied in their settings. For example, after the soul-testings

For example: For all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your minds are firm, forever (Jacob 3:2). Whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil (Alma 5:40). In the moving story that Alma the younger tells to his son Helaman, of his being redeemed from sin and turned to the joy of active goodness, we have an effective example of stirring literature. Writes Alma: And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul. And.... While I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world. Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.... When I thought this, I could remember my pains no more.... Yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!: Yea, and from that time... I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost (Alma 36:16 ff.). 643 Joseph Wm.

Certainly in the Book of Mormon there is a wealth of Wisdom Literature of practical, sterling worth. Added to this there are many places where the prophets of long ago days on our American continent made plain the divine principles of the gospel. As a striking example take the masterful interpretation of the resurrection and the restoration by the prophet Alma, as recorded in chapters 40 and 41 of the book of Alma, or from the same book in chapter 42, the exposition of justice and mercy. This represents really great religious literature. It is worth reading and re-reading; indeed one must read it often grow up with it, to grasp its deep import. A few concluding paragraphs from these splendid chapters will serve here to illustrate the profound thought, the high literary quality of the whole portrayal of divine truth: But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice. For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus none but the truly penitent are saved... Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds. If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the restoration of God. Only a few hints of the richness of the gospel messages, with some suggestions of their distinctive literary quality, their sincerity and clarity in revealing saving truths could be given in this brief lesson. Brought forth with divine help by the Prophet of these latter days, The Book of Mormon contains a wealth of reference: Book of Mormon. Each member of the class should provide her/himself 1. What is one essential difference between the Presentation of Wisdom Literature, as represented by "Proverbs" and such literature in the Book of Mormon? B. In what respect is there a similarity? Give, for example, one of the proverbs and some like gem from college example of an exposition of basic pos pel principles found in the Book of Mormon. Fall Term Starts Sept. 9-13 a.

Caution: In making any of the foregoing studies keep attention not alone on the doctrine but also upon the effective expression of the principles of life and salvation so well portrayed. The Book of Mormon while in consonance with the Old and the New Testament in the presentation of gospel truth has a distinctive style or way of presenting old truths. This is but natural, because of the different authors who have made the record and it adds to the charm of this "Book of Books." One good way to enhance the appreciation of this "New Witness for Christ" is to have some of its fine passages voiced or read aloud expressively.

From Sar Rosa Lee Lloyd, author of "Learn of Love," says that somewhere during her early education she learned about love and how important it is when writing poetry or fiction or staying married to the same man forever and ever. Rosa Lee began her writing career at the age of seven and even now she has to be careful or her imagination will run away with her. She has won two national story prizes and has sold numerous stories and poems to United States and Canadian national magazines. She was editor of the Year Book at Davis County High School, a member of the Utonian staff at the University of Utah, and she is a past president of the Art Barn board of directors, past president of the Barnacles (story-writing group) and is now the president of the Salt Lake Chapter, League of Utah writers. Mrs. Lloyd and her husband Llewellyn lost their gifted and promising son Tyndale in the recent war.

I should like to take this opportunity to mention the enjoyment I have gained from reading the fine material presented in the Relief Society Magazine. "The Visitors" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) and "'Pankapaw" by Deone R. Sutherland (March 1948) held a particular appeal to me.

Carol Read Flake, author of "Sudden Storm," tells us: 'Words cannot express the joy with which I received notice of the acceptance of my story. I am humbly happy that my first story is to appear in the publication of my own beloved Relief Society. During my mission to the Eastern States (1935-37) I served for a time as mission Relief Society secretary under Sister Don B. Colton. I am the mother of five children, four sons and one daughter. The oldest is eight and the youngest is one. I shall be happy when I can be regularly engaged in Church work, but I hope to have more children girls!

Re KR
I have received letters from people as widely separated as California and New Jersey referring to my recent article ("For Makers of Rhythmic Beauty," June 1948). One lady in the East wanted to start to work immediately on a course of work under me, but I had to tell her I was not teaching a correspondence course in the subject at this time.
You are putting out a very attractive and helpful Magazine. Warmest wishes for your continued success.

Anna S. D. Johnson, author of "The Seventh Handcart Company," published in the July issue of the Magazine, has been requested by many readers to furnish a list of the five couples married aboard ship. Here is the list:
C. C. A. Christensen and Eliza Haarby; C. C. N. Dorius and Ellen Gurinda Rolfson; J. F. F. Dorius and Karen Frandson; Lauritz Larson and Anne M. Thompson; Jacob Bastian and Gertrude Pederson.

"Some young people said regarding my story 'Questing Lights,'" writes Belle Watson Anderson, "that they thought everyone who came over on the trek was an old or tired person. 'How lovely to find they were young people, just like we are, with our problems."
