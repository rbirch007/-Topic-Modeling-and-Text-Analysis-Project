Caroline Eyring Miner Illusive as a columbine with wings, Half bird, half flower, in and out of sight, Fluttering green iridescent wings, as bright As air bejeweled with rain, now beauty weaves A mystic spell about me, for there clings To her the wild sweet longings from a night That I have lately known, the wondrous sight Of apple blossoms cradled in green leaves Freeing themselves and drifting like perfume, Pink purling, fragile, real as earth to me. So long as I can see the world abloom, See spring's fantastic flowered canopy, I shall know beauty that my heart will hold Against the winter when I shall be old.
