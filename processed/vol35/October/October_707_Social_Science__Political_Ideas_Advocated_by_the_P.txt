Political Ideas Advocated by the Prophet Joseph Smith Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, January 25, 1949

Prophet Joseph Smith. Evan Jensen as well as being a prophet, Joseph Smith was an American. As such, he underwent the political experiences of the Latter-day Saints and the Americans of his day. But towards these experiences he applied a growing conception and appreciation for political and religious freedom and related problems. From the revealed word he taught the doctrine and ideal of the kingdom of God.

Section 65 of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, dated at Hiram, Ohio, October 1831, identifies the infant Church he established as the kingdom of God on earth. Moreover, "the keys of the kingdom"�divine authority� had been re-conferred on men�himself and others.

Few people understand or realize the immediate significance of the Prophet Joseph Smith's inspired declarations, viewed in terms of political theory. The Latter-day Saints were exceedingly practical and proceeded with the business of "kingdom-building" on the American frontier, with city planning, economic and social experimentation, and proselyting activities which received local, national, and international attention.

By January 4, 1833, Joseph had written an American newspaperman, N. E. Seaton, that the secular States of the world were facing destruction, and that in order to escape, "all people, high and low, rich and poor, male and female," should repent and be baptized.

The snowball growth of the gospel, like Daniel's "stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands" (D. & C. 65:2) with its social system and Church government, attracted wide attention and received complex reactions, even persecutions. The Book of Mormon, with its ideal of true Christian society (IV Nephi), aroused antagonism as well as support.

This situation led to a rich political experience in Joseph Smith's own lifetime, as he endeavored to find the sphere of freedom within the practical political world, wherein the little "kingdom" could grow unmolested. Joseph Smith on the United States Constitution

Joseph Smith was ultimately forced by experience to the position where he elaborated and justified the use of force in order to maintain liberty. But more fundamentally, the Prophet's political theory presupposed conditions that would make resort to force unnecessary.

As early as August 6, 1833, pronouncement was made (D. & C. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�OCTOBER 1948 98:4-10) that the principle of freedom was God-given and "belongs to all mankind," and that constitutional law should support that principle.

A few months later, December 16, 1833, a revelation was received (section 101:76-80) in which the Constitution of the United States was set forth as the fulfillment of divine purpose "for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; that every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity."

Thus was opened the way for reconciling the conflict between kingdom building and the American nation, one of those nations supposedly headed for destruction unless the people received the gospel. In short, in Latter-day Saint belief, American government has a peculiar and special nature under a Constitution which is inspired because it fundamentally recognizes basic "free agency" or human liberty, a limitation which God established.

When the Prophet offered his dedicatory prayer at the Kirtland Temple, March 27, 1836, mercy was invoked "upon all the nations of the earth" and petition made that "the Constitution of our land... Be established forever" (D.& C.109:54).

Later, on March 25, 1839, a letter was penned in which the Prophet declared that the Constitution was "a glorious standard... Founded in the wisdom of God" because it embraced the principle (federalism combined with civil liberty) which "guarantees to all parties, sects, and denominations, and classes of religion, equal, coherent, and indefeasible rights" (D. H. C. III, page 304).

In other words, the Constitution of the United States sets up a political system within which the kingdom of God, itself mild in nature, subject to self-restraint and toleration, could flourish. The idea is that a good State must necessarily be limited to the extent that it guarantees liberty to and noninterference with religious groups and any other human association based on the liberty of individual conscience, provided that the association, in turn, recognizes the fundamental limitation of free agency, and which is imposed on the American State by its Constitution. As the Article of Faith puts it, as contained in Joseph Smith's letter, March 1, 1842, to John Wentworth: "We claim Almighty God according to the Articles of Faith." A State granting liberty of religion keeps open the avenue to morality in the people; thus may the voice of the people demand that which is "good." And if they do not, the remedy in Latter-day Saint political thought lies in the Church, whose responsibility it is, as Alma said, "bearing down in pure testimony against them," and in love and faith, awakening the individual and social conscience to worthy citizenship.

The Nature of American Government
A "constitutional federal republic" is perhaps the best descriptive phrase for the American governmental system. "Constitutional" means that the Constitution provides the fundamental limits of power while describing and distributing the powers among the government and states. The nation has complete authority over any individual or thing, except in wartime, when total powers have been exercised by the National Government. "Republic" means power is exercised and controlled primarily by representatives chosen from among the people. Thus we have our constitutional federal republic, in which public power is distributed, divided, and subdivided, in the interests of the people's liberties under law, but effective action yet made possible.

The Prophet on Practical Political Problems
On February 7, 1844, in support of his announced candidacy for the American presidency, Joseph Smith published a lengthy booklet. Views of the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States (Joseph Smith: Prophet-Statesman, pp. 144-167; D.H.C. VI, pp. 197-209). A number of interesting views are set forth such as:
1. The ever present danger that those elected to high office will look to their own selfish interests rather than those of the public.
2. Military preparedness: "To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace."
3. Peace, notwithstanding preparedness, must be the unswerving objective of foreign policy.
4. "Agriculture, manufactures, navigation, commerce, need the fostering care of government," including a "judicious tariff."
5. Reorganization of Congress to make a smaller, more workable body.
6. Practical politicians will make free use of "reform" measures to win fame and power instead of accomplishing real improvements.
7. The substitution of remedial, corrective measures for traditional methods of penology. "Let the penitentiaries be turned into seminaries of learning."
8. Abolition of slavery by compensating the owners.
9. Economy in public affairs.
10. Banking reforms suggestive of the federal reserve system of today.
11. Increased responsibility for the President in protecting civil rights.
12. Peaceful expansion of the American system to embrace Texas (then an independent nation), Mexico, Canada, and "all the world: let us be brethren, let us be one great family, and let there be universal peace." (For the Prophet's platform, see D.H.C. VI, pp. 390-392 or Joseph Smith: Prophet-Statesman, pp. 180-183).

The Mission and Destiny of America
Some suggestion of the Prophet's conception of the role of America in world affairs may be gathered from the foregoing discussion. His faithful follower, President John Taylor, put it this way a few years later: "It is true that the founders of this nation, as a preliminary step for the introduction of more correct principles and that liberty and the rights of man might be recognized, and that all men might become equal before the law of the land, had that great palladium of liberty, the Constitution of the United States, framed. This was the entering wedge for the introduction of a new era, and in it were introduced principles for the birth and organization of a new world." (The Gospel Kingdom, page 309).

On May 12, 1844, speaking of the kingdom of God ideal, the Prophet Joseph Smith stated: "I calculate to be one of the instruments of setting up the kingdom of Daniel by the word of the Lord, and I intend to lay a foundation that will revolutionize the whole world." (Joseph Smith: Prophet Statesman, page 200).

On April 8, 1844, he had told the general conference at Nauvoo: "The whole of America is Zion itself from north to south." (Ibid., page 198). As President Taylor expressed it on December 17, 1871: "The worst wish we have for the human family is that the principles enunciated in our Constitution may reverberate over the wide earth, and spread from shore to shore until all mankind shall be free." The obvious meaning of these views, propounded by the Prophet in relation to the mission and destiny of America, is that within the framework of constitutional principles, the restored gospel message of Christ the Lord can be spread and God's kingdom be established throughout the world. Tied with America and its Constitution, the "entering wedge of a new era," then, is the destiny of the human race. Whom the gospel message fails to attract will still have the benefit of American influence wherever constitutional freedom spreads and prevails.

The Constitution of the United States, American government, and the Church and kingdom of God are thus seen as twin, co-ordinate objects in the political thought of Joseph Smith, each with a mission of liberty and service to mankind. Questions for Discussion
1. What is the Latter-day Saint idea of the kingdom of God? (The following books contain excellent selections on the subject: Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith; Joseph Smith: Prophet Statesman; The Discourses of Brigham Young; The Gospel Kingdom; The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff; Gospel Doctrine.)
2. Does the principle of freedom belong to all mankind?
3. What is "all mankind"?
4. What reasons exist to support the belief that the United States Constitution is an inspired document?
5. What is the fundamental connection between religious freedom and good government? Why is the principle of religious freedom an essential element of a sound political theory?

Lesson 3 - The Presidency of Brigham Young

For Tuesday, January 25, 1949 Elder T. Edgar Lyon

THE PRESIDENCY A UNIT THE THREE ARE ONE
BRIGHAM YOUNG President Brigham Young

The second President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Brigham Young, was born in Vermont, June 1, 1801. In 1830 he was living in Mendon, New York, where he was following the trade of carpenter, joiner, painter, and glazier, when he first heard of the Book of Mormon. He was converted largely by this book, but did not join the Church until 1832, after which he moved to Kirtland and became intimately associated with the Prophet Joseph Smith.

At his first meeting with Joseph Smith, the Prophet called upon Brigham to pray, and in his prayer, he spoke in tongues, and the Prophet announced to those present that the gift was from God, and added, "'the time will come when Brigham Young will preside over this Church" (Nibley Preston, The Presidents of the Church, page 52). Brigham Young was selected a 712 member of the first quorum of Twelve Apostles of this dispensation, February 14, 1835. He played a prominent part in the Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois periods of the Church. In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, January 10, 1841, the Lord says: "I give unto you my servant Brigham Young to be a president over the Twelve traveling council" (D. & C. 124:127). Less than six weeks after Joseph Smith was murdered, Brigham Young and the Council of the Twelve Apostles were sustained as the presiding body of the Church. They functioned in this capacity from August 1844 until December 5, 1847, when the First Presidency of the Church was reorganized near Council Bluffs, Iowa. Brigham Young was sustained by the apostles as President of the Church and he chose two counselors, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards. Then the apostles sustained the First Presidency of the Church. Brigham Young was sustained president with Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as his counselors. They were sustained by the Church in the log tabernacle at Council Bluffs, December 27, 1847. The new President was to continue in this calling for nearly thirty more years. During this time, because of the loss of his counselors by death, he was assisted by two additional first and two additional second counselors other than those previously mentioned. Brigham Young stood at the head of the Twelve as the governing body at a time when there was need for a leader of great forcefulness. The members of the Church have all heard or have read the testimonies of those who were assembled in the Grove in Nauvoo, after the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum, when the Quorum of the Twelve, with Brigham Young at its head, was sustained as the Presidency of the Church. Typical of these testimonies is that of Emmeline B. Wells (the fifth general president of the Relief Society) who was present when "the mantle of the Prophet Joseph fell upon Brigham Young and so transfigured him that the people marveled." All through the long years of her life, she related this incident in the assemblies of the saints with earnestness and vigor. It was evident that the saints would soon have to leave Illinois. This called for great organizing ability and much wisdom in choosing a new location as well as resourcefulness in providing the means of getting there. The records of the Church during this period indicate that Brigham and his brethren met frequently and studied reports on the Far West. Then, under the inspiration of God, they decided upon their place of settlement. "We will carry out all the measures of Joseph," said Brigham. Many times he expressed the conviction that his experiences with the Prophet during the journey to and from Missouri with Zion's Camp were the most valuable that could have come to him in fitting him for the exodus to the West. In addition to the practical leadership of Brigham Young, he was preeminently a spiritual leader. Under his direction the unfinished temple at Nauvoo was rushed to completion. This was done at great sacrifice in time, money, and labor even when it was apparent that the saints would not long enjoy its use. He was determined that they should have the benefits of their temple endowments and do some ordinance work for the dead, before they embarked on the long trek to the West. When Brigham Young entered the Salt Lake Valley for the second time in the fall of 1848, he had two counselors who were well qualified for the responsible positions they held. Elder Kimball was a man of sound judgment and great courage, and with his other gifts he had an unusual sense of prophetic insight. Willard Richards was a man of penetrating intelligence and added much to the technical organization of the Church and the establishment of the institutions that were needed for their government and in the regulation of their interrelations in their new pioneer life. After entering the Great Basin, Brigham Young commenced to unfold the plan for building the "kingdom of God" in a most remarkable fashion which indicated a great vision of the future destiny of the Church. Emphasis was placed upon the necessity of providing the essentials to maintain life—the securing of food, clothing for the cold winters, and shelter from the cold and heat. He urged the people to be economically self-sustaining and to this end he encouraged the emigrating saints and the missionaries who were abroad to bring or send to Zion artisans of trades and occupations which could be adapted to the use of the Latter-day Saints in their mountain homes. Coal mining, iron smelting, cotton raising, silk culture and manufacturing, tanning of hides, manufacturing of paint, shoes, harness, hats, linen, paper, ink, glass and lead products, cabinet and furniture works, soap making, woolen manufacturing, the sugar beet industry, and others were commenced, in addition to the usual farming and livestock activities. 713 MUSIC FOR THE RELIEF SOCIETY CHOIRS WURLITZER ORGANS WURLITZER ORGANS WURLITZER ORGANS FOR BETTER ACCOMPANIMENTS SELDON N.

AT YOUR BOOKSTORE The planting of the many settlements from San Bernardino, California, and Carson Valley in the west, and from Call's Landing in Arizona to Fort Lemhi on the Salmon River in Idaho in the north, were all made as part of his plan to establish latter-day Israel firmly in these mountain valleys, and to enable them to utilize the various natural resources for the temporal salvation of God's people. Along with these activities the spiritual needs of the people were not forgotten. Every settlement was in reality a planned Church unit, under the leadership of the bishopric. No settlement was without its combination Church-schoolhouse, and it became the center of the spiritual life of the people. The great pioneer leader did not think it sufficient to send out a colony and then read reports of its activities, but he endeavored to visit each colony, yearly, if possible. On these pilgrimages he encouraged the colonists with sound, practical advice and fed them the bread of life by preaching to them spiritual messages as he spoke under the inspiration of God. He encouraged them to seek wholesome recreation that would restore their tired bodies and invigorate their minds.

Nor was he forgetful of the need of increasing the membership of the Church nor the divine obligation to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth. The missionary work in Europe was expanded to include most of the Continental nations, and more systematic organizations were effected to cover the North American continent and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. Through the organization of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company, many thousands of converts were enabled to emigrate to Zion through this cooperative enterprise who otherwise would never have been able individually to meet the costs of the journey.

Prior to his joining the Church, Brigham Young was an obscure laborer engaged in farming, the building trades, and functioning as an unpaid Methodist class leader. It was through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, his contacts with the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the power of the Priesthood that he was enabled to lead the Church as he did. He declared: I do not wish men to understand I had anything to do with our being here. That was the providence of the Almighty. It was the power of God that wrought out Salvation for His people. I never could have devised such a scheme.

When he passed from mortality on August 29, 1877, at Salt Lake City, the life of a great prophet-leader closed amidst the scenes of the great achievements his leadership had accomplished in the barren wastes of western America. B. H. Roberts said of him: These achievements write down Brigham Young as the Greatest Pioneer and Colonizer of modern times—an Empire founder; and place him easily among the first score of Great Americans.

716 HEBER C. KIMBALL
Heber C. Kimball
The man whom Brigham Young chose to be his first counselor in the Presidency of the Church in 1847 was one of his closest personal friends. He was well suited to the task and Brigham's close acquaintance with him had revealed the characteristics that were needed to help him carry the tremendous load that he would have as President of the Church. Heber C. Kimball was born in Vermont, on June 14, 1801—just thirteen days after the birth of Brigham Young. He likewise had established himself in Mendon, New York, but he had learned the trade of a potter as well as farming, and in 1830 at the time of a "revival," had joined the Baptist church. About three weeks after his baptism he heard of the restoration of the gospel and he and Brigham and Phineas Young and their wives journeyed to Pennsylvania where they visited with members of the Church. In April 1832, he was baptized and in September of that year he and Brigham and Joseph Young visited Kirtland and met the Prophet Joseph for the first time. They soon moved to Kirtland, and from that time until the death of the Prophet, Elder Kimball was closely associated with him, being one of the original group of Twelve Apostles.

He was sent by Joseph Smith in company with other brethren to open the British Isles to the preaching of the restored gospel in 1837, where they firmly established the Church in those countries. In Nauvoo he became an enthusiastic worker for the development of the saints' city, and after the death of the Prophet was a loyal supporter of President Brigham Young. When the Presidency was reorganized on December 5, 1847, President Young assigned to him the first place in the counselorship, and for the remaining twenty-one years of his life, he stood by his best friend as he had previously supported his Prophet.

In the pioneering of the Great Basin, Elder Kimball was one of the planners and stimulators. With Brigham Young he visited the colonies that had been established in the various portions of the then expansive Utah Territory, and spoke prophetic encouragement to the struggling saints. He was also a member of the territorial legislature for many years. His particular gifts in speaking appear to have been his ability to speak the language of the common man and to explain doctrines and make them impressive through the use of homely stories and apt sayings which were long remembered and afterward quoted by the saints as gospel truths. He was also possessed of a fine sense of discernment. Particularly did this spiritual gift manifest itself in predictions.

718 At Nauvoo when they first commenced to establish the city he remarked: "This is a beautiful place but not a long resting place for the Saints." 'This incensed Sidney Rigdon who was convinced that their troubles were over, but Brother Kimball's prophecy was soon fulfilled.

Many are the stories told of his predictions concerning the future of the saints and their troubles and of the Church and its destiny. As a result of a severe fall sustained in Provo, Utah, he died at Salt Lake City on June 22, 1868. Brigham Young lost in him a wise counselor and the saints an approachable leader who lived close to them. God had taken one of the most humble of this world to confound the mighty, the wise, and the strong.

Topics for Discussion and Study

1. What characteristics did Brigham Young possess for the great work that was placed upon him at the death of Joseph Smith?
2. What purpose do you suppose Brigham Young had in establishing many small settlements throughout the intermountain region, rather than the settlement of a few large cities?
3. What particular contribution did Heber C. Kimball make to the establishment of the Church in its western home?
4. Read and evaluate Heber C. Kimball's "Address to My Children," found on page 151 of Life of Heber C. Kimball.

Park Free Articulate, Resonant Words In Singing Florence J. Madsen Member, General Board of Relief Society
Words are freeborn.... They have the same right to dance and sing as the dewdrops have to sparkle and shine—Abraham Coles.

N song the words are just as important as the music. They represent the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are to be conveyed. It is essential, therefore, that they are fully understood by the listener. However, the words are not to be overspoken to the sacrifice of the tone quality, nor should they be spoken in the small speech form of ordinary conversation. The singer, like the dramatic reader, must use the large speech form which means the full use of all the resonating cavities of the head and face.

This further implies that the mouth is well opened, the lower jaw thoroughly relaxed, the tip of the tongue touching the lower front teeth for all vowels. In the meantime all the resonating cavities such as the hard palate, the sinuses, the nose, the face-mask, etc., should be unobstructed so that they can function fully as amplifiers of the tone.

To obtain the most satisfactory word-resonance the hum tone must be cultivated. The singing-hum is properly produced by observing the following:

(a) Yawn position of mouth
(b) Closed lips
(c) Teeth well apart
(d) Tongue relaxed, teeth (e) Lower jaw free and unprotruded touching front

This hum is to be practiced with "M" in three different ways:
1. Sustained on various pitches in the medium part of the voice
2. Partial scales and arpeggios (chordlines) then in their entirety
3. Well-known song melodies, such as "Sweet Hour of Prayer," "Abide With Me," "Love's Old Sweet Song" (chorus), etc.

During all humming and word singing the following vocal positions should be adhered to:

(a) Erect standing or sitting
(b) High and expanded chest and ribs
(c) Contracted abdominal muscles

With practice these positions can be maintained without the least semblance of rigidity. This is accomplished when all of the released energy used in singing is balanced and equally distributed and when all of the muscles concerned remain elastic and easily subject to the dictates of the will.

Singing, as well as being an aesthetical expression, is very definitely a physical exercise, and all normal physical exercises are possible only through equalized and correlated energy.

From fear and Sar
Maryhale Woolsey, author of "Curtain Call," was born in Spanish Fork and has lived in Utah most of her life. As a young person, she was indignant that no one had ever written a song about our western mountains—so she did something about it and the ever-popular "Springtime in the Rockies" was the result. She writes stories, poems, plays, and songs. Her work has been published in the Church magazines and Eastern and Canadian magazine. She is a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), League of Utah Writers, Art Barn Poets, and National Writers Club.

Mrs. Woolsey has four daughters who are also talented in writing and art. She attended the B. Y. U. In Provo, Utah.

Your executive officers very kindly placed me on the complimentary list for The Relief Society Magazine. I should like to become a paying subscriber if this is possible, as the articles on the old pioneering days and old customs are interesting.... During the war the Rector one day had two young American ladies in uniform who paid us a visit from London and asked to be shown over the church. During the visit one stated that her grandmother had been in service as a housemaid in the rectory over ninety years ago and her mother wanted a photograph of the old rectory, which was duly done. It is things like these which link our two nations together, also our two churches, although many miles apart.

I am taking this liberty to send in my appreciation for your splendid Magazine, although I am not a member of the organization, being a man, but I have been treading the Magazine for almost half a century, and I must say some of the finest contributions include the short stories.


I used to wonder why we didn't have more writers of stories, real life stories, written by our own people. Now that wish has been realized during recent years for some of the very best stories are found in The Relief Society Magazine.

F. M. Shafer, Moab, Utah

One of the most interesting pages in the Magazine to me is the reprint page from "Sixty Years Ago." It seems to link my contribution to Relief Society, small as it is, with all those who have gone before. I feel the magnitude and timelessness of this work.

Wasn't it fun to read the fashion notes in the last issue on that page (September 1948)? Mabel Jones Gabbott, Salt Lake City, Utah
