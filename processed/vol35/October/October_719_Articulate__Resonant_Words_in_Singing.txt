Articulate, Resonant Words In Singing Florence J. Madsen Member, General Board of Relief Society
Words are freeborn.... They have the same right to dance and sing as the dewdrops have to sparkle and shine—Abraham Coles.

N song the words are just as important as the music. They represent the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are to be conveyed. It is essential, therefore, that they are fully understood by the listener. However, the words are not to be overspoken to the sacrifice of the tone quality, nor should they be spoken in the small speech form of ordinary conversation. The singer, like the dramatic reader, must use the large speech form which means the full use of all the resonating cavities of the head and face.

This further implies that the mouth is well opened, the lower jaw thoroughly relaxed, the tip of the tongue touching the lower front teeth for all vowels. In the meantime all the resonating cavities such as the hard palate, the sinuses, the nose, the face-mask, etc., should be unobstructed so that they can function fully as amplifiers of the tone.

To obtain the most satisfactory word-resonance the hum tone must be cultivated. The singing-hum is properly produced by observing the following:

(a) Yawn position of mouth
(b) Closed lips
(c) Teeth well apart
(d) Tongue relaxed, teeth (e) Lower jaw free and unprotruded touching front

This hum is to be practiced with "M" in three different ways:
1. Sustained on various pitches in the medium part of the voice
2. Partial scales and arpeggios (chordlines) then in their entirety
3. Well-known song melodies, such as "Sweet Hour of Prayer," "Abide With Me," "Love's Old Sweet Song" (chorus), etc.

During all humming and word singing the following vocal positions should be adhered to:

(a) Erect standing or sitting
(b) High and expanded chest and ribs
(c) Contracted abdominal muscles

With practice these positions can be maintained without the least semblance of rigidity. This is accomplished when all of the released energy used in singing is balanced and equally distributed and when all of the muscles concerned remain elastic and easily subject to the dictates of the will.

Singing, as well as being an aesthetical expression, is very definitely a physical exercise, and all normal physical exercises are possible only through equalized and correlated energy.

[Note: The short articles on music which appear in the Magazine may form the basis for the discussion in the choristers' and organists' department at union meeting.]

From fear and Sar
Maryhale Woolsey, author of "Curtain Call," was born in Spanish Fork and has lived in Utah most of her life. As a young person, she was indignant that no one had ever written a song about our western mountains—so she did something about it and the ever-popular "Springtime in the Rockies" was the result. She writes stories, poems, plays, and songs. Her work has been published in the Church magazines and Eastern and Canadian magazine. She is a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), League of Utah Writers, Art Barn Poets, and National Writers Club.

Mrs. Woolsey has four daughters who are also talented in writing and art. She attended the B. Y. U. In Provo, Utah.

I am truly grateful for all the many years of fine reading I have enjoyed through the Magazine.
—Mrs. Wanda E. Stewart, South Gate, California

It is nearly 100 miles to the nearest Church from our home and my only connections are through the monthly Magazines and I enjoy them very much and look forward to receiving them. Thank you very much for the wonderful Magazine and may God bless and keep you.
Mrs. Lilly Bennett, Menasha, Wisconsin.

Just now I sent in another group of Magazine subscriptions for our small branch. I picked up my expiring copy and again read the inspiring poetry therein. Such a beautiful book you are giving us. Money couldn't buy mine back. The contents are complete, especially for a homebody like myself, but the poetry is the best anywhere. It is the first thing I read.
—Darliene Thompson, Tulsa, Oklahoma

Your executive officers very kindly placed me on the complimentary list for The Relief Society Magazine. I should like to become a paying subscriber if this is possible, as the articles on the old pioneering days and old customs are interesting.... During the war the Rector one day had two young American ladies in uniform who paid us a visit from London and asked to be shown over the church. During the visit one stated that her grandmother had been in service as a housemaid in the rectory over ninety years ago and her mother wanted a photograph of the old rectory, which was duly done. It is things like these which link our two nations together, also our two churches, although many miles apart.
—F. Z. Claro, Sidesman, St. Mary's Church, Corringham, Essex, England.

I am taking this liberty to send in my appreciation for your splendid Magazine, although I am not a member of the organization, being a man, but I have been treading the Magazine for almost half a century, and I must say some of the finest contributions include the short stories.


I used to wonder why we didn't have more writers of stories, real life stories, written by our own people. Now that wish has been realized during recent years for some of the very best stories are found in The Relief Society Magazine.

F. M. Shafer, Moab, Utah

One of the most interesting pages in the Magazine to me is the reprint page from "Sixty Years Ago." It seems to link my contribution to Relief Society, small as it is, with all those who have gone before. I feel the magnitude and timelessness of this work.

Wasn't it fun to read the fashion notes in the last issue on that page (September 1948)? Mabel Jones Gabbott, Salt Lake City, Utah
